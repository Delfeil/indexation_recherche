 Patients presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain represent a substantial challenge to the physician. To differentiate among the various causes of abdominal pain, several key features of the history must be explored in depth (onset of pain, location of pain, intensity of pain, particular pattern of pain referral) and a complete physical examination should be meticulously executed. A number of metabolic or primarily medical conditions may cause abdominal pain, and great caution must be maintained if these are to be recognized (pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, diabetic ketoacidosis, etc.). There exists several groups of patients in whom the usual symptoms and expected findings are not apparent; children, the elderly, the chronically debilitated, the depressed, and those patients chronically exposed to steroids are examples. Laboratory findings and imaging techniques should be carefully evaluated because they may provide the only clue to a diagnosis not previously considered. A useful guide to the management of patients with abdominal pain in the emergency room concludes this brief review.
