Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was first described by Northway et al. in 1967. Since that time advances in neonatal intensive care have markedly improved survival for preterm infants; however, bronchopulmonary dysplasia has remained a clinical problem and is associated with high mortality and morbidity at present. Data on preventive and therapeutic strategies are in part conflicting. A current survey is absolutely necessary for the neonatologist to choose appropriate treatment for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
