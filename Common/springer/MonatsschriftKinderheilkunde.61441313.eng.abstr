The surgical approach to the newborn with PAt-IVS is to establish an adequate source of pulmonary blood flow and, when possible, relieve right ventricular outflow obstruction. The selection of patients for pulmonary valvotomy, alone or in combination with a systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt, depends on the presence of a right-ventricular outflow tract and the adequacy of the right ventricular chamber.  During the last years novel interventional approaches by heart catheterization have been developed, which allow perforation and subsequent balloon dilatation of an atretic pulmonary valve and/or stenting of the ductus arteriosus.  We report our experience with these new interventional techniques in four neonates. In three patients highfrequency or mechanical perforation and subsequent balloon dilation of the atretic pulmonary valve was performed without complications. In one newborn with hypoplastic right ventricle and sinusoids with retrograde coronary perfusion the ductus arteriosus was stented via left arteria axillaris.  Although no general conclusion can be drawn from our applications, interventional perforation of the pulmonary atresia and/or ductus stenting become an attractive interventional approach for the initial treatment of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum.
