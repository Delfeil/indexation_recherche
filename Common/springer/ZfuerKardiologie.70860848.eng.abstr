 We report about a 66-year old patient with Non-Q-wave infarction in coronary artery two-vessel disease. During an echo- and transesophageal multiplane echodardiography preoperatively before a coronary artery bypass surgery a right atrium septal tumor of unknown form was discovered. The computerized axial tomography (CAT) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scans did not demonstrate extracardiac pathologic findings. A transesophageal echocardiography-guided biopsy of the right atrial septum over the vena femoralis and the right atrium enabled intra vitam a very early diagnosis of high malignant B-cell Non-Hodgkin-lymphoma without the need for thoracotomy. The diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically and immunhistochemically and early treatment with cytostatic therapy could begin. To our knowledge the transesophageal echocardiography-guided biopsy has never been described in the worldwide literature.
