The hereditary ataxias are a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterised by progressive ataxia that results from degeneration of the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent connections. With respect to the pathogenic mechanisms, the hereditary ataxias may be tentatively  divided into three groups: (1) The recessive ataxias are induced by the functional impairment of a protein that is essential for the  survival of specific neurons while the autosomal dominant ataxias are either caused  by (2) mutations of genes coding for ion channels thus resulting in a channelopathy or by (3) a novel deleterious function of a extended polyglutamine sequence within the proteins encoded by the respective genes.
