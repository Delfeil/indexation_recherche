Intraoperative control of torsion is delicate in intramedullary nailing of femur and tibia fractures. Post-traumatic torsional deformities cause clinical problems if the rotational 0-position, according to the neutral-0-method, cannot be attained or exceeded. The necessary precondition for every indication and planning of corrective osteotomies is conscientious analysis of the geometry of the lower extremities by clinical means, radiography and computed tomography. Operative procedures and techniques of corrective osteotomies in case of torsional deformities after intramedullary nailing are presented. Preoperatively, the intraindividual torsional differences in 15 patients with maltorsions of the femur were 33 ° (-37/+50) and in 7 patients with maltorsions of the tibia 23 ° (-21/ +29). Positive signs indicate external and negative signs of internal maltorsions. Postoperatively, the intraindividual torsional differences were 6 ° (-3/+14) in the femora and 7 ° (+3/+12) in the tibiae. Therefore, the physiological torsional tolerance of 15 ° was respected in all 22 patients. Additionally, limb lengthening was realized in 4 patients with shortening after intramedullary nailing of the femur. In 3 patients a one-step procedures with interposition of allogeneic cancellous bone in the osteotomy gap was performed and in one patient continuous callus distraction by external fixation.
