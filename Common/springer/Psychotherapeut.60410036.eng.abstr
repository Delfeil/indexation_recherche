Psychosomatic diagnostic aims at increasing the precision of the indication and the effectiveness of the therapeutic process. The concept of simultaneous diagnostic has proved to be beneficial in clinical work. It establishes a focus for various diagnostic and therapeutic facets: soma vs psyche, psychodynamic vs family dynamic and institution vs individual. It requires a procedure that adapts to the specific situation of the patient and takes into account that the therapist himself is a diagnostic instrument. This concept of simultaneous diagnostic is discribed in this article through an example drawn from the practice of a psychosomatic clinic. The value of the operational psychiatric classification systems as well as the value of individual case histories is discussed, on the basis of empirical research which has accompanied the clinical work.
