In recent times, psychotherapeutic strategies tend to be based on empirical studies. These otherwise important efforts can only be of limited value when investigating human and psychotherapeutic communication. "General psychotherapy' and'ntegrative psychotherapy' need a basic understanding of psychotherapeutic communication. Such a basis can be derived from the philosophical and anthropological concept of "communicative existence' as put forward in the work of H. G. Gadamer. The anthropological definition of psychotherapeutic communication as a playing field of human intercourse leads to an integrative, basic "hermeneutic position' of understanding psychotherapies in general. Apart from this, certain factors for effecting change in psychodynamic psychotherapies are described which can be summarized under the headings "Hermeneutic counselling' and "Hermeneutic psychotherapy'. "Hermeneutic counselling' and "Hermeneutic psychotherapy' make systematic use of three human abilities in order to deal with desintegrated experiences: the formation of memories, the creation of representational images and interactional experience.
