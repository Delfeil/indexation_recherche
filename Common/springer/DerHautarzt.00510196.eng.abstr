Therapy of Darier disease is rarely satisfactory. Oral retinoids can improve the skin lesions. Because of previous positive results with topical retinoids, which were often not practical because of marked skin irritation, two patients were treated with the new, topical acetylene-retinoid tazarotene in a 0.01% gel preparation. In both patients skin cleared within 2 to 4 weeks. After stopping the medication patients did not develop any new skin lesions for 12 months. In a third patient, healing with tazarotene gel 0.025% was faster than with a topical preparation containing 10% urea. Tazarotene is an important addition to the therapeutic possibilities in Darier disease.
