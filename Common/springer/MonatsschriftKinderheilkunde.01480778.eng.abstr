Case report. We report on the case of a 14- year-old female patient who initially attracted attention by dyspnea and retrosternal pain. An echocardiographic examination revealed aortic dissection of the ascending aorta. She succesfully underwent an operative therapy. In spite of some typical symptomes the diagnosis marfan syndrome hadn't been made before.
