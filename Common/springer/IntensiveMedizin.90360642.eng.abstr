 Myocardial infarctions may be precipitated by external triggers. External triggers include physical activity and emotional stress as well as other infrequent triggers such as war threats or earthquakes. Changes in the environment also play an important role in the incidence of myocardial infarctions; circadian, seasonal, and weekly variations have been observed. Patients' behavior at the onset of symptoms depends on various factors and influences outcome and mortality. Appropriate preventive measures are indicated in order to protect patients during vulnerable periods. Health education should be directed towards patients' behavior and promptly seeking medical assistance at the onset of symptoms.
