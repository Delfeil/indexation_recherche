A 69-year-old woman presented with widespread symmetrical papular lesions in submammary and inguinal areas. History revealed that the disease had only been present for a few years. A skin biopsy showed focal suprabasal acantholysis, dyskeratosis up to the horny layer and in part parakeratotic hyperkeratosis. The patient had no further evidence for Darier disease, Hailey-Hailey disease or pemphigus vegetans. In particular, characteristic lesions of Darier disease of hands and nails were absent. We found several reports in the literature describing similar skin lesions in intertriginous and genital areas with histological evidence of acantholytic dyskeratosis under various terms. This report discusses the difference between these cases and the differential diagnoses, in particular Darier disease. We propose to designate cases of intertriginous papulosis with histological proof of acantholytic dyskeratosis but without further evidence of Darier disease as intertriginous acantholytic dyskeratosis.
