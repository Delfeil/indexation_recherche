 Prognostically relevant factors based on the histological assessment of the resected pancreas are known. However, additional parameters, such as biological staging of the intrinsic malignant potentiality of the tumor, would be useful. There has been no uniform finding of a relationship between CD44 variant expression and tumor progression. Method: We assessed the expression pattern and prognostic impact of CD44 standard and CD44 isoforms v4, v5, v6, v7 and v10 in 40 ductal pancreatic carcinomas by immunochemistry on paraffin-embedded tumor material in patients after tumor resection. At the time of the investigation neither histomorphological parameters nor the survival time were known. Results: There was no correlation between the histomorphological parameter and the expression of CD44 splice variants. CD44 splice variants v4-v10 were almost only expressed in tumor tissue. In ductal pancreatic carcinoma, patients with an overexpression of CD44 splice variants had a worse prognosis. However, because of the small number of cases this was statistically not significant. Conclusion: CD44 splice variants may have an influence on prognosis in ductal pancreatic carcinoma. However, further investigation on a larger number of patients is necessary to confirm these results.
