 A 53-year-old female patient developed disseminated, filiform keratoses up to 4 mm long on the back, arms and neck and upper thorax for the first time 10 years ago. There were no associated diseases or symptoms. Treatment with etretinate was successful. After discontinuing this therapy the patient had a relapse. With this observation we bring new arguments into the discussion on filiforme keratoses.
