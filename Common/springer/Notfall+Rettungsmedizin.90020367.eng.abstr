Duties, function and position of the Chief Emergency Physician (CEP) as found in the literature are well defined by law. The present study analyses quality and quantity of the realization of this law at the end of december 1997. The study shows 7 areas without a CEP-system and 4 areas with a system, not legitimated by the authorities. Only in 7 out of 24 CEP-systems a regulated schedule for the CEP on duty was found, only 11 systems worked with written official regulations. Essential equipment like safety-clothing, communication-systems (radio, cellular phone), legitimation-papers and administrative-material was seen complete in just 3 systems. In 11 systems the CEP had to use his private car to reach the scene of emergency, without the possibility of using siren and lights. The worst equipment was found in systems where physicians had to use their own car.
