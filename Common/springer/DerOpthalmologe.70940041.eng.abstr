Correct positioning of transscleral haptics for sulcus fixation of IOL haptics may be difficult due to lack of visual control by the surgeon. We determined the haptic sites in eyes which underwent secondary IOL implantation with transscleral suturing using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) (Humphrey Instruments, Inc., San Leandro, CA, USA). Eighteen eyes of 17 patients were included in the study. The follow-up time ranged from 1 to 36 months (mean: 7 months). The positions of 36 IOL-haptics were documented by UBM examination. Twelve haptics (33%) were found in the sulcus, whereas 18 haptics (50%) were located posteriorly to the sulcus. Six haptics (17%) were identified anteriorly to the sulcus. There were no complications resulting from dislocation. In one of the eyes, suture infection occurred requiring surgical revision and antibiotic therapy.
