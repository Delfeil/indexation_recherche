We report on 30 cases where we have used cortical stimulation mapping to define the areas representing sensorimotor, language and speech functions under local anesthesia to facilitate resection of space-occupying lesions near these areas. Under the simplistic concept that Broca's area lies in the frontal operculum (inferior frontal gyrus) and that Wernicke's area is located in the posterior perisylvian area (superior temporal, angular and supramarginal gyri), we found language and speech function to be represented outside these areas in up to 4 stimulation sites of 15 patients. The results of cortical stimulation mapping were therefore essential to decide on the optimal access route to the lesions that were located subcortically and on the optimal resection plane in gliomas. After the limits of these areas and of the lesions had been established with stimulation mapping and with intrasurgical microscopic smear preparations, respectively, lesions were safely removed under continuous monitoring of sensorimotor, language and speech function. Immediately after surgery we encountered language and speech deficits in 9 patients (30%), which resolved completely in 5 and inclompletely in 4 instances. Thus, language functions were normal in 26 patients (87%) at the end of the follow-up period. It is concluded that use of this technique allows safe and extensive resection of lesions that would otherwise have been considered hazardous to remove or inexcisable.
