Chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia makes the immuncompromized cancer patient even more susceptible to severe infections. The risk of infections correlates with grade and duration of febrile neutropenia. Empiric antibiotic treatment can diminish the high infection-associated mortality. There are guidelines for antimicrobial treatment and modifications of therapy. To individualize therapy decisions, it is helpful to characterize high- and low-risk patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis in afebrile neutropenic patients is only indicated in special cases. Use of G-CSF for prophylaxis of neutropenia can be recommended for high-risk patients, but it should not be used for the treatment of infection.
