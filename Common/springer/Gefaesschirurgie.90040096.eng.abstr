 Four years after extensive pneumonectomy on the left side with resection of the aortic wall and patch reconstruction for a T4 carcinoma, 2 years after adjuvant radiation and 10 months after drainage therapy of late intrathoracic empyema, destruction of the infected Dacron patch led to rupture of the aorta descendens. Successful primary emergency reconstruction of the aorta descendens was followed by venetian blind plasty (Heller) and transposition of the omentum majus for omentoplasty of the aortal wall and reduction of the pneumonectomy cavity. The rate of prosthetic infections is between 0.3 and 2.5% and must be taken into consideration even in cases of intrathoracic vascular reconstruction with alloplastic prostheses. After lung resection it is necessary to cover up the prosthetic graft by using autogenous material to obtain prosthetic incorporation into the protective tissue. In intrathoracic infectious complications, extra-anatomic bypass grafting or autogenous vascular graft implantation should be considered. If there is no possibility of carrying out these procedures, first aggressive local debridement of the infected vascular wall and afterwards coverage with alloplastic prosthetics with omentum transposition and thoracoplasty are essential to minimize postoperative infection and obtain solid anchorage in the surrounding tissue.
