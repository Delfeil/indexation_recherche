Compression therapy was employed for 4 weeks 20 patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage CVI I and CVI II according to Widmer's classification. Compression bandaging for 2 weeks was followed by compression stockings for 2 more weeks. The cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated before therapy, after 2 weeks and after finishing compression therapy after 4 weeks. Marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after 4 weeks, along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume. Video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and pericapillary halo diameter. Compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation. The efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar.
