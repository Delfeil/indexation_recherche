In a retrospective study we examined the clinical and sonographic changes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with lig. patellae. 51 patients were evaluated clinically and sonografically after arthroscopically assisted ACL-reconstruction with a bone-patella tendon 3-6 years (mean 4,3 years) postoperatively. Certainly 18 patients (35%) reported about an anterior knee pain, but only 2 patients (4%) complained about pain during activities of daily living and 3 patients (6%) about pain during slight sports activities. Retropatellar crepitations was found in 24 patients (47%) on the operated side and at 11 patients (22%) on the non operated side. Twenty nine patients (57%) complained about a discomfort or pain when kneeling on the operated side. In13 patients (26%) sonography showed a shortening of the patella ligament by 4 mm or more. Only few patients are strongly limited in their activity by the anterior knee pain. Neither our results nor the literature give evidence, that the tendon defect is the underlying cause of this pain syndrome. However, the number of patients with pain during kneeling on the operated side was relatively high. The semitendinosus gracilis graft should be considered for patients who have to knee during working or recreational activities.
