Processes in the middle ear can occasionally lead to clinical disorders extending beyond the anatomic boundaries of the area of the mastoid process. In contrast to this, pathological processes of the areas adjoining the middle ear might also lead to secondary involvement of the tympanic area. The report describes an initially asymptomatic epidural hematoma, which secondarily led to involvement of the middle ear. In general, such cases affecting the middle ear will produce symptoms usually interpreted as primary middle ear pathology. This association shows which disorders must be considered, the differential diagnosis and methods of therapy.
