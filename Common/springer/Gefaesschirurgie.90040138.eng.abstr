 Heparin-induced or -associated thrombocytopenia type II (HIT II) is the most important clinical side effect of heparin therapy. At the University Hospital of Jena the detection of HIT II antibodies has been done using the heparin-induced platelet activation assay (HIPA) since 1995. During this period, 89 patients of the surgical clinic were examined under a clinical suspicion of HIT II syndrome. Indication for the HIPA was thrombocytopenia or any thrombembolic complication during therapy with heparin. In 21 patients the results were positive. In 15 cases, prior to the diagnosis of HIT II, complications known as white clot syndrome occurred [pulmonary embolism (n = 1), shunt reocclusion (n = 3), arterial thrombosis, embolism or reocclusion of bypass (n = 8), deep vein thrombosis (n = 4)]. 8 patients had a history of similar events during earlier phases of therapy with heparin. Three of the patients died. Therapy with heparin implies frequent control of thrombocyte count. In any case of thrombocytopenia and/or thrombembolic complications testing for HIT II antibodies is necessary. If it is positive and vascular reconstruction is indicated, we recommend hirudin for anticoagulation.
