The electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) is characterised by an up to 10-fold increased speed in comparison to a spiral CT scanner. Although originally designed for diagnosing the heart, some indications in the chest and for the vessels have also become well established. In the forefront exists the possibility to exam a large volume with a small slice thickness in a short time period without having to sacrifice on important features of spiral CT scanning. During one breathhold, the thorax can be continually examined with 1.5 mm slice thickness, which means that indications for high-resolution (HR-) CT, spiral-CT and for virtual bronchoscopy can be combined into one examination. Beyond the artefact-reduced images, the EBCT presents image data which, following image processing (sliding MIPs, coronal reconstructions), allow recognition of a new horizon in thoracic diagnostics.
