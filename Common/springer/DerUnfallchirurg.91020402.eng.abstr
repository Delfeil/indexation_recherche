A technique utilizing the Ilizarov ring fixator to stabilize a tibio-calcaneo-naviculo-cuboideal arthrodesis following talus resection is introduced. The advantages of this method will be demonstrated with the help of a case history. The described method permits early weight bearing, while supplying stability and compression of the fusion, thereby avoiding further loss of bone stock, while reducing the risk of thromboembolic complications. The Ilizarov ring fixator construction allows for the combination of the fusion with the correction of a preexisting or ensueing leg length discrepancy.
