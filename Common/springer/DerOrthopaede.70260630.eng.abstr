After loss of active glenohumeral motion the arm cannot be positioned in space and function is impaired. Fusion of the glenohumeral joint creates a new platform for the movement of elbow, hand and fingers and leads to an improvement of function. The use of the reconstructive plate makes the operation easier. Shoulder fusion is especially suited if the function of elbow and hand is well preserved and if the patient is physically active. But fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered.
