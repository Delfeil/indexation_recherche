During the last 30 years a great number of case reports presented severe anaesthetic complications with sudden cardiac arrest in patients with muscular dystrophies, mostly unsuspected at the time of the event. As succinylcholine was involved in the majority of the intractable incidents with lethal outcome the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States recommended a warning of the administration of succinylcholine in young children and adolescents in 1992 and an extensive international discussion on the routine use of succinylcholine in paediatric anaesthesia. Epidemiological studies on this issue are rare. We projected an inquiry about the incidence rate and type of severe anaesthetic complications in an utmost large number of patients and families with Duchenne (DMD) and Becker type (BMD) muscular dystrophy.
