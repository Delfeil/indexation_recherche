One rare case of so-called massive idiopathic osteolysis Gorham-Stout is presented. In a 77-year-old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2.5 month following trauma. As a histologic cause for the osteolysis, a marked stimulation of osteoclasts on the spongiosa, especially intracortically, was observed.  The course and the clinical findings are described, and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature. The results suggest that an early antiresorptive therapy (calcitonin, bisphosphonates) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes.
