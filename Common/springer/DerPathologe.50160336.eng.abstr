Recanalisation of the carotid sinus is one of the most frequently performed vascular interventions; endarterectomy of the coronary arteries is an auxiliary measure accompanying aortocoronary bypass. Enucleation of the sclerotic plaque is followed by reconstruction of the intima and by rapid smoothing over of the "steps" along the side of the recanalised segment by proliferation of smooth muscle cells from the remaining media. The thinner the residual media, the thicker grows the neointima. Occasionally elastic lamellae reminiscent of a lamina elastica interna are formed close to the lumen. Moreover, in some cases renewed formation of the characteristic intimal spur (fibrotic ridge) is seen at the carotid sinus inlet, a sign of continued irregularity of blood flow postoperatively. In contrast, no focal lesions are generally observed in recanalised segments in the coronary arteries. New sclerotic pads that occur in the late phase bear a morphological resemblance to those in operated restenoses. The distribution of these pads is largely congruent with that of the sclerotic plaques in non-operated cervical arteries. Thus, even when recanalisation of the carotid sinus is uncomplicated, reparative processes are followed by the re-formation of sclerotic pads, largely determined by haemodynamic factors. In the coronary arteries, concentric rather than focal sclerotic lesions predominate.
