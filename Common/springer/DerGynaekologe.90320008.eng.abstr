In the future the goal should be increased cooperation between the different disciplines of obstetrical work (maternity ward, lying-in ward, parents' school). At the same time, personnel continuity in patient care should be ensured. Since the solution is difficult, inclusion of freelance midwives in the clinic like the Charité-Virchow model could be helpful. More important for the acceptance of clinical obstetrics than the means "alternative" delivery is how interested the members of the obstetrics team are in the patient and her care and well-being.
