 Acute spinal cord injury affects more than 3000 individuals per year with predominantly young people between 15 and 20 years of age being involved. Analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care. Therefore, there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed. The first hours after the accident are decisive, because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later. Besides the fate of the individual patient, the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care, long lasting rehabilitation, as well as post rehabilitative care.
