In a retrospective study 47 patients with 68 amateur and 25 professional tattoos were examined, considering clearance of tattoo pigments and the frequency of side effects after finished treatments with the Q-switched ruby (694 nm) and the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (532 and 1064 nm). Black amateur tattoos were found to lighten faster than professional tattoos (13,2 and 18,6 treatments respectively). For the clearance of multicolored tattoos (amateur or professional), similar numbers of laser treatments were needed. Green pigments were removed with the Q-switched ruby laser and red pigments with the frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm). Compared to the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm), the Q-switched ruby laser and the frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) more often caused blistering and transient hypopigmentation (5,4% and 7,5% vs. 1,1% (blisters); 8.6% and 15.1% vs.4.3% (hypopigmentation)).
