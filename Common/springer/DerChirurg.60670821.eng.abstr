 Between 1983 and 1993, 680 patients with rectal carcinoma were treated at Ulm University. The resection rate was 84 %. After undergoing radical surgery, 492 of the patients were followed up regularly at our hospital for a median of 66.9 months (range 4-177.6). Recurrences occured in 172 patients (35 %) and were diagnosed a median of 13 months (range 4-106 months) postoperatively: 9.4 % had regional recurrences, 10.4 % regional recurrences and distant metastases and 10.2 % distant metastases. The 10-year survival rate of the patients in tumour stages I, II and III was 88 %, 62 %, and 32 %. In patients with carcinoma of the midrectum, after anterior resection or abdominoperineal amputation the same local recurrence rate was found.
