 Benign tumors of the pancreatic head are normally treated by a partial duodenopancreatectomy. This operation has been developed for the treatment of malignant alterations in the pancreatic head and includes resection of the gastric bowel, duodenum and common bile duct. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the less radical duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is a suitable surgical procedure in the treatment of benign pancreatic head tumors. From May 1982 to December 1996, seven patients underwent surgical treatment for benign pancreatic head tumors. Two patients suffered from gastrinoma of the pancreatic head, four exhibited a serous or mucinous cystadenoma, and one patient suffered from an intraductal papillary-mucinous tumor in this region. All patients were treated by duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection. The operation was easily performed with little blood loss and a low rate of complications. None of the patients had to be reoperated upon due to postoperative surgical complications. After a follow-up period of a median 3 years, six of seven patients were had no recurrence of the disease and were symptom-free. One patient who had initially been operated on for gastrinoma still exhibited high gastrin values postoperatively. The endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function was not impaired in the early and late postoperative phase as compared to the preoperative assessment. From our results, it is concluded that duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is an adequately radical, yet organ-preserving procedure for the treatment of benign tumors of the pancreatic head without compromising endocrine and exocrine function.
