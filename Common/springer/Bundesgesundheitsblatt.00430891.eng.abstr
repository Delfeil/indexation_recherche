Patients infected with viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF), pneumonic plague or zoonotic orthopoxvirus infections usually require intensive care and a special isolation. Contact persons must be traced and monitored. Last year our working group published a concept for the management and control of these life-threatening highly contagious diseases.  Now the principles of our plan have been accepted.  The development of guidelines for rapid reaction to those communicable diseases is an important task for all EU Member States. In Germany microbiological diagnosis is performed by a diagnostic centre (Biosafety-Level BSL4) and supported by a corresponding confirmation laboratory. At present four high security infectious disease units for patient care (HSIU) are available in Munich, Leipzig, Hamburg and Berlin. Another one located in Frankfurt will be functional by 2001. In addition to the HSIU a corresponding number of centres of competence shall be established in order to support and advise the hospitals initially treating the patients as well as the local public health officer.  The risk categorisation for contact persons, which has been developed by our working group, has proved to be very useful in practice. Ambulances should be used for transfer of patients to the HSIU. So-called transport-isolators are not suitable for patients who are seriously ill. Air-based transport without using an isolator is a problem, since no decontamination procedure exists.  As soon as the last HSIU in the Rhine Main area is working the centres of competence will be established. This will provide competent health care for VHF-patients and a convincing management for these kinds of threats to public health everywhere in Germany.
