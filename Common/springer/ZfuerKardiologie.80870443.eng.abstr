  The role of enteroviral myocardial infection in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy could only be substantiated after the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in-situ hybridization) in virological diagnostics of dilated cardiomyopathy. By using histological and especially immunohistological techniques for the detection of myocardial inflammation in patients with the tentative clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, a differentiation between inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of the WHO classification 1995 (31) was made. Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis in association with cardiac dysfunction and is diagnosed by established histological and especially immunohistological techniques. The combination of histological, immunohistological, and molecularbiological techniques enabled a subgroup analysis of the incidence of enteroviral myocardial RNA in patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy in comparison to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
