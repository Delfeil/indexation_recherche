The invisible long-wave ultraviolet radiation (340-450 nm, max. 365 nm) produced by a Wood lamp can help to diagnose dermatoses with a characteristic fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas infections, porphyrians, and pigmentary alterations). It is also used in the detection of medications that are taken systemcally (tetracycline) or that are applied to the skin. Recently, a fluorescence technique with Wood light has been used as a preventive measure to monitor and quantify skin protection at the workplace and to teach workers in high-risk occupations the proper use of protective creams.
