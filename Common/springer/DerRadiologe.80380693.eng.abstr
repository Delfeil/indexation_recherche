In Europe ultrasonography has displaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in the primary survey of polytraumatized patients with suspected abdominal trauma. Hemodynamically unstable patients who are brought to the emergency room with blunt abdominal trauma will go directly to the operating room after a rapid ultrasonography examination with evidence of hemoperitoneum. In hemodynamically stable patients, in addition to ultrasonography, computed tomography can be done. This is especially efficient if evaluation with sonography is not completely possible or shows little pathology (e.g. small amounts of hemoperitoneum).
