The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint. In all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in 111 patients (79,3%) we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results. All in all we have found complications in 14 patients. In 4 cases we have seen a delayed wound healing, in 2 cases a superficial infection, in 3 cases a deep infection, in 3 cases a neural damage and in 2 cases a phlebothrombosis. Our study show, that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy, exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the portals. The use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate.
