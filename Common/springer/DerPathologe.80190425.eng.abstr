Lung dust analyses were performed on tumor-free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors. The measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients' occupation as stone mason. No evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found.
