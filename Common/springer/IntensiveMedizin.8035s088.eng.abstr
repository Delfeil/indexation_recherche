  Patient data management systems (PDMS) are hardware/software products especially designed for the documentation of treatment in intensive care medicine. The advantages of PDMS are continuous high quality documentation, comparability of data due to the availability of a data bank, additional information at the bedside, precise data for the calculation of the overall cost of the patient's stay. The technical design of PDMS depends on an integration of network technology into the hospital. It will be appropriate to conncect the systems to the Internet, but safety requirements have strongly to be followed. Concerning the database, client server architecture as well as language standards like SQL should be used. Object oriented databases will be available in the near future. Another future goal of PDMS will be using knowledge based technologies within these systems. Drug interactions, disease related diagnostic and/or therapeutic techniques and other information sources can be integrated.
