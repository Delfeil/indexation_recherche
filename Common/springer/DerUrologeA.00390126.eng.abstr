Radiotherapy unequivocally has to be regarded as standard therapy in stage I and IIA/B testicular seminoma. Using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95-98 % in stage I disease and 80-95 % in stage IIA/B can be achieved. Disease specific survival reaches 100 %. Likewise, radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) in a solitary testis or in case of a double-sided TIN yielding safe eradication of the in-situ carcinoma of the testis. Objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates.
