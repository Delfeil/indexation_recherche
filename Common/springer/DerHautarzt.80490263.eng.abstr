Between 1988 and 1994 more than 40 monographs dealing with dermatologically relevant drugs have been published in an official German government publication, the "Bundesanzeiger". These monographs represent reviews compiled by independent dermatological and pharmaceutical authorities working together in an expert commission and most of their information has proved valid. Thus, knowledge of these official reviews could help physicians to decide about the use of many drugs. However, they are not well-known to doctors. With this brief summary we hope to make more physicians familiar with these important monographs published in the "Bundesanzeiger".
