It is still a matter of controversy whether anastomosis of the sensory nerves is necessary in free transplants of microvascular reanastomosed myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flaps in the oral cavity and oropharynx. Some surgeons perform this routinely because they expect fewer complications in skin with a sensory nerve supply. We clinically examined 30 patients in order to assess the sensory innervation of the transplant tissue. All patients received free transplants of microvascular reanastomosed latissimus dorsi flaps during a tumor operation in the oral cavity. Sensation was determined clinically according to pain, temperature, pressure, two point discrimination and vibration. In most patients sensation in the Latissimus dorsi flap does not return. These findings suggest that reinnervation in the myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap mostly does not occur, indicating that there is a need for anastomosis of a sensory nerve during transplant surgery with a myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap to reinnervate it.
