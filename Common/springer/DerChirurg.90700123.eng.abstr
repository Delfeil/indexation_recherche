 For patients with liver metastases, surgery currently represents the only possibility for cure, with a mean 5-year survival rate of 25-35 %. Due to refinement in operative and anesthetic techniques and improved critical care with decreased morbidity ( < 25 %) and mortality ( < 5 %), hepatic resection is a safe and efficient procedure. Surgery has repeatedly achieved long-term disease-free survival in 20-25 % of patients. However, only 10-25 % of patients with colorectal liver metastases can undergo potentially curative liver resection. Therefore, accurate staging plays a pivotal role in selecting patients who would benefit from surgery. For metastatic colorectal cancer, resection offers the only potential for cure. For symptomatic neuroendocrine tumors, hepatic resection offers long-term palliation in many cases and cure in some. The role of hepatic resection for noncolorectal and nonneuroendocrine metastases, however, is less well defined. Recurrence of hepatic metastases after seemingly curative resection is observed in about 40-60 % of the cases. Only 20-35 % of these recurrent metastases appear to be resectable, resulting in an overall 3-year survival rate of about 30 %. The morbidity and mortality from repeat hepatectomy is similar to that of first hepatic resection. All results together demonstrate that resection and re-resection of liver metastases can provide long-term survival rates and can be beneficial in a carefully selected group of patients without extrahepatic disease.
