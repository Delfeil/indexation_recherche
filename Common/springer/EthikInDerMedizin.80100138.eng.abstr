Abstract.  Definition of the problem: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a new technique to test the in-vitro embryo for genetic disorders. Currently in Germany a debate arises whether the use of PGD is ethically acceptable. Many authors emphasize that PGD might lead us on a slippery slope towards the killing of persons, the creation of designer babies or the discrimination of disabled.
