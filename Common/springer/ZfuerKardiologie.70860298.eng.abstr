  Chronic myokarditis predisposes to the occurrence of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. It is not known if an immunosuppressive treatment - as a causal therapy - leads to arrhythmia suppression. In the present study, 12 patients (four female, eight male, mean age 53  +/-  15 years) with a mean left-ventricular ejection fraction of 52  +/-  19 % were included. After exclusion of coronary macroangiopathy, the presence of chronic myocarditis was demonstrated by immunohistological evaluation of right-ventricular biopsies taking the number of specific lymphocytes (CD 2-8), of activated macrophages and the degree of HLA-expression on interstitial and endothelial cells as a basis. Seven patients had a successful resuscitation due to ventricular fibrillation in their case history, three patients presented sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and two syncopes with inducible tachyarrhythmias. As a "conventional" therapy ten patients received antiarrhythmic drugs and four patients an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator. After confirmation of the diagnosis by a second biopsy after 3 months, all patients underwent an immunosuppressive therapy with methylprednisolone. The initial dose of 1 mgkg body weight was reduced by 20 mg each every 2 weeks, until a maintenance dosage of 8-12 mgday was achieved. If the control study after 6 months still gave a positive result, a combined therapy with azathioprine, 100-150 mgday, was carried out for a further 6 months.
