We report the cases of four abused children from two families, in which despite a correct medical diagnosis social and legal measures failed to protect children from further harms and injuries. As a consequence one of the children already seriously harmed by abuse was injured again; in both families a second sibling suffered severe physical injuries with fatal outcome in one child.
