 The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ventilation with positive endexspiratory pressure on regional systolic wall motion of the left ventricle using transesophageal echocardiography. The study group consisted of 17 patients with acute respiratory failure admitted to our intensive care unit. Patients with regional wall motion abnormalities were excluded. The transesophageal probe was placed in standard position for evaluation of the left ventricle (LV) in the four chamber view (long axis) and for monitoring LV cross section in the transgastric view. Continuous videotape recordings were made during ZEEP ventilation (zero end-expiratory pressure), continued after mode switch to PEEP 16 cm H2O over 5 minutes and again after removal of PEEP 16 cm H2O over 5 minutes. The endocardial contours were examined in stop frame video projection. Wall motion was analysed semiautomatically using a centerline model. Regional motion of the LV wall was evaluated by systolic percentage changes of segmental hemiaxis.
