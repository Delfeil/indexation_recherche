The prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not treated is unfavorable, with a reported 5-year survival of 0-18 %. Before the era of immunotherapy and in the absence of effective nonsurgical therapy, resection of metastases was the accepted way to prolong survival, giving a 5-year survival of 7-69 %. Retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis. Some patients will benefit from resection of metastases, but most patients with metastatic RCC are not candidates for such aggressive surgery. The use of interleukin-2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions. Without randomized trials, it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients, but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long-lasting remissions in selected patients. Many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit-to-risk ratio of immunotherapy, but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic RCC.
