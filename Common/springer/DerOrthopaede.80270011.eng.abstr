The hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man's work. The multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality, sensibility, motor function and stability. In severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor. In a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand. The cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw. Basically, we recommend an extended primary repair. After the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures. We start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints. Thereafter, suturing of extensor and flexor tendons. Then, we do the microsurgical reconstructions of vessels and nerves. In case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap. In a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first. Our results in vitality and sensibility are listed. In the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important. Therefore, it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery.
