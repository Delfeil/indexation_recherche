Angiofibromas are usually characterized by their occurences in adolescent males with a typical localization and involvement of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx. Even the suspicion of an extranasopharyngeal angiofibroma or an angiofibroma in young children must be viewed in general with skepticism, although reports of angiofibromas with atypical localizations and manifestations in young children have appeared in the literature. Three cases of this fibro-vascular neoplasm with manifestations in the first decade of life and atypical localizations are presented: (1) an angiofibroma medial to the left lacrimal sac in a 15-month old boy, (2) a right paranasal localization in a 9-year-old boy and (3) an angiofibroma limited to the right sphenoid sinus in a 6-year old boy. In all three cases the neoplasm was resected via an endonasal, micro-endoscopic approach that avoided an external incision. According to the literature and based on our own experiences with typical histological findings in all three cases, the clinician has to be aware that the rare angiofibroma can occur in pre-adolescent children with atypical localizations. The endonasal surgical approach is without any doubt the least traumatic one and in selected cases allows resection of a circumscribed tumor considering functional and aesthetic aspects.
