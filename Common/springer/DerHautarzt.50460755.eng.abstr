Naturally occurring animal models are not available even for most common skin diseases. Transgenic technology developed during the 1980s is closing this gap. It was initially used as a tool by scientists in basic research, but during the last 5 years it has increasingly been applied by clinically oriented basic researchers in dermatology. This technique, has made it possible to imitate HIV-associated diseases and genodermatoses in the murine model and to elucidate their pathogenesis. Owing to specifically induced epidermally localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice exhibited similarities to those of the psoriatic epidermis. Such animals are also useful for studying wound healing. Furthermore, transgenic technology enables us to induce cutaneous tumors selectively. The availability of animal models for human skin diseases is also of value in elucidating experimental therapeutic approaches, e.g. the somatic gene therapy.
