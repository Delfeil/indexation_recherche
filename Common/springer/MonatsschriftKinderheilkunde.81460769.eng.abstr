Enteritis and pseudoappendicitis are typical manifestations of Yersinia infections in children. This is a report on a child with localised tumourous mesenteric lymphadenitis due to Yersinia enterocolitica persistent for a long time. We found specific antibodies against Yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat-edly in the patients' serum. Only after a ciprofloxacin therapy for 16 weeks we observed a recovery of our patient.
