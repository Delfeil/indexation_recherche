Laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years. Due to its physical properties, the CO2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and ablating tissue. The high absorption of its wavelength in water (=10600 nm) is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue. Shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects, such as carbonization and coagulation. This effect can be lessened with the SilkTouch scanner, since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating mirrors. This enables a controlled and reliable removal of various dermal lesions. Particularly well-suited for treatment hypertrophic scars, post-acne scarring, perioral and periorbital wrinkles, rhinophymas and benign neoplasms including verruca vulgaris. Cosmetically favorable reepithelialization of the treated skin surfaces occurs within a very short time after treatment. Periorbital resurfacing and correction of a rhinophyma are used as examples of dermal treatment with the CO2 laser and the SilkTouch scanner.
