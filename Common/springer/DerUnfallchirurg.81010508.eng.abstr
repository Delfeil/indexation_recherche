2-4 % of vascular injuries need operative reconstruktion. In polytraumatized patients the rate is even 10 %. Arterial vascular repair should precede venous reconstruction and orthopaedic stabilization due to limb threatening ischemia. Penetration or blunt vascular trauma result either in acute blood loss, ischemia or compartmental compression. Reperfusion syndrom leads to vital threat of patient. Clinical assessment, measurement of limb pressures using a Doppler device and use of duplex ultrasonography are reliable adjuncts in the rapid evaluation. Arteriography is rarely indicated and should be spared for patients with abnormal physical examination. Minimizing ischemia (6-8 h) is an important factor in maximizing limb salvage. Vascular repair include direct anastomosis or lateral suture repair mostly combined with primary shortening of the extremity. In most cases autogenous vein graft is required. Rethrombosis, arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysms are possible complications. Stabilisation of the fracture has priority over vascular reconstruction. The initial steps to success are surgical debridement, adequate bony stabilization mostly by external fixation, revascularisation of vascular injury, immediate fascial decompression and early soft-tissue reconstruction. The best results are obtained when a multidiciplinary approach is used combining expertise in orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.
