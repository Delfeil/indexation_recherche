Background: The paper focuses on the issues, how couples cope with SIDS and how this can be facilitated by subsequent children, self-help and professional support. Methods: In a retrospective study, 60 couples, members of a self-help organization, were studied at the average of 5 years (2-215 months) after their loss. Depression, anxiety, physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires. A community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls. Results: Average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample. Men and women coped differently with the loss: Bereft mothers were more depressed and ruminated more about cause and preventability of the death than fathers. They expressed their grief more openly and found it more helpful to speak about their loss. The presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss; an early subsequent pregnancy was fraught with increased anxiety. Conclusions: The self-help group serves an important function as a coping resource; the pediatrician plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families.
