Study objective: Ketoprofen exerts its clinical effect by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, but also acts as an NMDA-receptor antagonist by means of the kynurenic acid. Based on ketoprofen's supposed central mechanism of analgesia, we expected a pre-emptive effect, which was assessed by the present study.
