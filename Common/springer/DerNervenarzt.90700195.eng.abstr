A multifactorial etiology underlies the  majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both ill-defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease. Allele 4 of ApoE is a genetic risk factor. Its presence increases the risk of developing AD. However, presence of e4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise. Apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease, there are rare variants which are inherited as Mendelian traits. To date three genes are known that can be  mutated in these rare forms of AD. Of these, mutations in the gene presenilin 1 on chromosome 14 are most frequent. In addition, mutations in the gene presenilin 2 on chromosome 1 and in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP on chromosome 21) occur in autosomal dominant AD. This article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of AD and discusses its relevance for patients with AD and their relatives.
