Fifteen patients at the University of Mainz were diagnosed as having T3 or T4 carcinomas of the paranasal sinuses that invaded the orbit. Treatment involved surgical resections of tumor with adjacent periorbita but without enucleation in an attempt to preserve vision and/or cosmesis. Survival rates and especially the rate, time and locations of recurrences were investigated. Analysis of the data revealed that preservation of the eye in these cases with advanced sinus carcinomas with orbital tumor involvement did not seem to worsen prognosis. The individual gain in terms of quality of life through the preservation of vision and cosmesis seems to justify the surgical approach used.
