Contrast enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) provides high resolution angiograms within 20-40 sec. The technique is based on the acquisition of heavily T1-weighted threedimensional (3D) gradient-echo data sets (FISP) with ultrashort echo- (< 2 ms) and repetition times (< 5 ms) during the arterial phase of an intravenously injected bolus of a T1-shortening agent such as Gd-DTPA. For MR-angiography of abdominal vessels CE-MRA is better suited than "time-of-flight" (TOF) and phase-contrast (PC) MRA because motional artifacts can be obviated with breath-held acquisitions. We have optimised the technique and evaluated its potential for angiography of the abdominal aorta and its branches as well as the portal vein and its tributaries. Whilst CE-MRA provides reliable diagnostic accuracy in the aorta and the proximal sections of its branches, small peripheral arteries cannot be assessed accurately. The portal vein and its tributaries can often be depicted better with CE-MRA than with conventional angiography but, like conventional angiography, CE-MRA is hampered by slow and reversed flow, conditions under which TOF or "true FISP" MRA may perform bst. We have also investigated FLASH-echo-planar imaging (EPI) hybrid techniques, a further technical development which due to shorter acquisition times of 12-15 sec. allows semi-dynamic imaging of the arterial and venous phase and provide better vessel contrast due to the use of fat-suppression.
