  Myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions. Frequent causes are intercurrent infections, fluctuations due to the natural history of the disease and insufficient immunosuppressive treatment prior to the crisis. Early referral to an experienced neurologist is essential. Specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with clucocorticoids. Infections must be treated vigorously. Thymectomy in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized. In cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties, early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed. Adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications adversely affecting prognosis. Whenever it can be achieved, the best therapy of myasthenic crisis is its prevention by appropriate long-term management and follow-up of patients with myasthenia gravis.
