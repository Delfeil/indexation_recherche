During the years 1985 up to 1995 53 patients between 18 and 80 years of age (mean age 54,7 years) with histologically and clinically proven Zoon's balanitis were treated by circumcision. The majority of patients had symptoms for more than 12 months. In five cases they had lasted for 8, 10, 16, 17 and 47 (!) years. 30 patients were investigated by means of physical examination and questionaire in this retrospective study. Lesions involved glans in all patients, while in 17 of 30 patients both glans and prepuce were involved. None of the patients showed lesions of the prepuce only. In most cases Zoon's balanitis was successfully treated by circumcision in a period of two to four weeks. In four cases, psoriatic lesions, and in one case lichen ruber was diagnosed. In the remaining patient, whose circumcision was inadequate, a small area of balanitis persisted in the sulcus coronarius still covered by the foreskin. The curative effect of adequate circumcision in 100% of patients suggests that Zoon's balanitis is a relatively non-specific reactive balanitis caused by a disturbed "preputial-ecology". It is remarkable that other distinct inflammatory diseases of glans and prepuce can show features which are identical to those Zoon's balanitis.
