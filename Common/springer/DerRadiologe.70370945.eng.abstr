High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) provides excellent contrast between osseous structures, air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution. Therefore, thin-section HRCT with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures. The indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma and tumor, the "postoperative middle ear", and malformations. In most cases, HRCT enables differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor. The excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells, of osseous defects of the tegmen, of the bony labyrinth, and of the tympanic course of the facial canal. In addition, HRCT enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles. Although HRCT is the first method of choice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases. This is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. In addition, MRI offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of IV contrast material. Therefore, MRI may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by HRCT. The differentiation between a meningocele or meningoencephalocele and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by MRI. Furthermore, MRI can accurately depict cases of labyrinthitis or of neuritis of the facial nerve or of intracranial disease caused by middle ear processes, while this is not always possible by HRCT.
