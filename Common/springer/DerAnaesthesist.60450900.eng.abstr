Cimetidine is a commonly used H2-receptor antagonist that has been recommended for the prevention of acid aspiration syndrome and has been shown to potentiate vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of a single IV dose of cimetidine on the neuromuscular effects of rocuronium, an analogue of vecuronium with a short onset time.
