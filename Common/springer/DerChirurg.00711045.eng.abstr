Abstract.  Over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee. Among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials, the central bone patellar tendon bone graft, a quadrupled hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance. With some limitations, allograft materials can also be used. Each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties, graft fixation and graft incorporation. Clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others. When choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered. For the treatment of multiple ligament injuries and for revision cases, thorough preoperative planning is necessary and modified graft selection may be required.
