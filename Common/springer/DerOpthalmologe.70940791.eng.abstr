Background: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is associated with the development of a posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC). The development of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) after cataract surgery and a decrease of central visual acuity is sometimes misinterpreted by the patients as natural course of RP. Therefore, therapeutic intervention is often delayed.
