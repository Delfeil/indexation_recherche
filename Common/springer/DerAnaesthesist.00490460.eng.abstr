Today, substrates with immunomodulatory effects are not only identified in all groups of macronutrients, but also in the domains of vitamines and traceelements. Mainly they interfere with 3 areas of the immune response: 1. the mucosal barrier function, 2. the cellular defense function, and 3. the local or systemic inflammatory response. Enteral formulas enriched with immune-enhancing diets are already in clinical use to encounter "immunoparalysis" of cellular defense during critical illness. Considering defined outcome variables, indeed, current clinical studies point out some improvements. Using an evidence based approach, a grade A recommendation was proclaimed for its broad clinical use. For defined subgroups of patients, however, presenting with most severe appearances of SIRS and consecutive organ failure, the current concept of enteral immunonutrition remains to be a matter of debate, and the evidence of clinical benefits persist to be questionable.
