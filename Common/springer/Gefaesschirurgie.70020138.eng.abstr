 Patients with pAOD who are considered inoperable sometimes can be operated upon successfully when paramalleolar and isolated tibial arterial segments are present and revascularization seems possible. These vessels must be searched by additional examinations, including surgical exploration. Availability of a good quality vein and careful surgical technique are the primary conditions for good results. Using the "in situ" technique for grafting, we were able to achieve a limb salvage rate of over 70% by discharge from the hospital in 16 selected patients. In directly compared cases the segmental revascularizations show better results than pedal reconstructions.
