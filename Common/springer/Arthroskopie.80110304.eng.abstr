The aim of this retrospective study was to compare operative and nonoperative medial collateral ligament (MCL) treatment in patients who underwent arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. In 38 patients we performed operative MCL repair by adaptive sutures; in 27 patients the MCL injury was treated conservatively. The postoperative rehabilitation protocol includes brace treatment for all patients over a 6-week period. Group II patients (conservative MCL treatment) had significantly better mean quadriceps muscle strength at 4 months postoperatively. In group I (operative MCL treatment) we performed a rearthroscopy due to postoperative loss of extension in nine patients. In group II postoperative loss of extension was removed arthroscopically in four patients. After a mean interval of 23 months we saw no difference in the prevalence of anterior or medial instabilities. Four patients of group I had a loss of extension (-5 ° in comparison with the uninjured leg). In group II two patients had a loss of extension. The Lysholm scores of the two groups were similar (group I: 85.05; group II. 85.3). The position on the Tegner activity scale was 5.4 (preoperatively: 6.1) in group I; group II reached a level of 5.5 (preoperatively: 6.0). The results of our study demonstrate that 2 years after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction there is no difference between patients who have had conservative or operative MCL treatment. With regard to the higher operative risk, we conclude that there is no need for operative MCL repair.
