 Transfer of both ventilatory work and control of breathing from the ventilator to the patient are the hallmarks of weaning from mechanical ventilation. According to these principles, we investigated four modern ventilatory modes for supported spontaneous breathing: Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV; ASB, IPS), Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure Ventilation (BIPAP), and Proportional Assist Ventilation (PAV, PPS) with Automatic Tube Compensation (ATC).
