A 39-year-old female patient presented with an intense allergic reaction and shock after ingesting sunflower seeds and simultaneously acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Skin tests and CAP specific. IgE demonstrated an IgE-mediated sensibilization to sunflower seeds. When sunflower seeds were eaten alone, only discrete paresthesias of the oral mucosa occurred. Surprisingly, an oral challenge with ASA was well tolerated. The supplementary centribution of ASA to the allergic reaction was done-dependent. The quantity of the allergen also modified the intensity of the symptoms. This surprising effect of ASA may be attributed to increased gastric resorption of the allergens. During the course of this reaction, eosinophil-cationic-protein was released.
