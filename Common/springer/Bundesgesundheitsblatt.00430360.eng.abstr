In a world with continuous political and economic change it is a clearly stated goal of the World Health Organisation to promote a strong consciousness of the need to protect the public health within the European region. Environmental conditions that detrimentally affect health should be minimised through internationally agreed upon measures, or preferably, be avoided. To achieve this it is critical that there is agreement on international standards in the areas of environmental health, estimation of health risks and problem solving strategies. It is important to ensure that there is a thorough understanding of environmental health problems/issues/concerns on the part of governments and the general public. The Regional Office of the WHO for Europe, Copenhagen, co-sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Health, Bonn established in the summer of 1997 a WHO Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health (WHO-CC), at the Robert Koch-Institute in Berlin to develop and maintain a system by which environment and health experts can communicate important information among themselves and to the public in clear and mutally understandable ways.
