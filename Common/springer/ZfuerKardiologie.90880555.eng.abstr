 Diagnosis of systemic venous drainage is mandatory for patients with congenital heart disease planned for cavopulmonary anastomosis or any Fontan-type palliation. Preexisting venous channels as the persistent left superior vena cava are common in cardiac anomalies and may lead to postoperative deterioration and cyanosis. We describe a 6 month old boy with a complex imbalanced atrioventricular septal defect who developed cyanosis in the very early postoperative period, following bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. It was caused by ineffective lung perfusion due to a reopened persistent left superior vena cava with drainage to the coronay sinus.
