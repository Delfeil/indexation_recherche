 Since the middle of the 1980s,? reports of invasive infections caused by streptococcus pyogenes are increasing world wide. In a retrospective study the frequency, symptoms, course, therapeutic possibilities, and microbiological characterization of this disease were examined. In the study, all 10 patients (seven females/ three males, average age 45.0 [4-71]) of the district hospital of Reutlingen were included who had a proven streptococcus pyogenes infection between Sept. 1994 and May 1996, defined by isolation of group A streptococci from a sterile site. Isolates were analyzed for serotype and production of exotoxins in the National Reference Center (Jena) of that time. In relation to the approx. 272,000 inhabitants of the district of Reutlingen, our numbers for invasive infections are within the range of the data established in the USA on population-based studies (incidence between 1.5 to 4.3 per 100,000). In seven patients,? influenza-like symptoms were observed previous to the acute deterioration of the disease. There was a conspicuous accumulation of the severe courses of toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) with the following criteria: shock, multiorgan failure, soft tissue necrosis, and generalized erythema (n=6). All surviving patients with TSLS had to be treated during several days with assisted respiration (7-16 days). One female patient with TSLS died on the day of admittance due to an intensive septic shock. In the analysis of the isolated strains,? no uniform results regarding the serotypes and the production of exotoxins were found. The following therapeutic measures are required immediately: antibiotic treatment, surgical treatment of the infective focus, and the established intensive care therapy in cases with multiorgan failure. The observed prodromal symptoms underline emphatically the possibility of an early intervention in the course of the disease.
