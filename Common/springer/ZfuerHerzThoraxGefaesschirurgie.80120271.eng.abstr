  In myasthenia gravis the management of anesthesia should always be individually adapted to the severity of the disease. Current medical therapy with cholinesteraseinhibitors should be continued till the morning of surgery. Regional anesthesia is the preferrable anesthetic technique. The administration of muscle blocking agents should be avoided. This can be facilitated by the sole or additional use of spinal/epidural procedures. These will furthermore provide adequate postoperative pain relief without significant respiratory depression. If non depolarizing muscle relaxants cannot be avoided they need to be used with extreme caution and should be titrated to effect, as patients with myasthenia gravis show an increased susceptibility to these drugs. Independent of the anesthetic technique monitoring of neuromuscular function must be performed. As myasthenic patients are especially susceptible to postoperative respiratory depression they need to be observed closely for the first 24 hrs postoperatively and should have their respiratory function monitored and regularly evaluated.
