Background and objective. In 1970 Ralph W. Grover described a clinicopathologic entity characterized by pruritic keratotic papules and papulovesicles predominantly on the trunk, disappearing spontaneously after a few weeks or months and demonstrating the histological features of epidermal acantholysis. The etiology remains unknown; sweating, heat and sunlight are suspected trigger factors. In our survey the clinical spectrum of the disease will be examined.
