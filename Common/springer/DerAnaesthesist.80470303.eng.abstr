Study objective: The clinical effect of ketoprofen is based not only on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Ketoprofen also acts through kynurenic acid as a central antagonist on the NMDA receptor. Due to this central analgesic mechanism of ketoprofen, we expected an analgesic preemptive effect. This study was carried out following the Breivik/Stubhaug preemptive effect study design.
