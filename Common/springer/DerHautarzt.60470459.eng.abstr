The kava plant is a member of the black pepper family; an intoxicant beverage prepared from the roots of this plant is used ceremonially by many traditional societies of the Southern Pacific. The beverage induces relaxation, enhances a sense of sociability and promotes sleep. These effects are utilized in herbal drugs containing kava, which are sold for insomnia, nervousness and depression.
