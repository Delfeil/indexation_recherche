Port wine stains (PWS) can lead to considerable emotional distress. The present study evaluated a) the coping with illness, the quality of life and the body image of patients with PWS and b) the effects of dye laser treatment on psychosocial parameters. Seventy PWS patients undergoing treatment with the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (FPDL) were assessed with questionnaires regarding coping with skin disease, quality of life and body image. Major clinical criterium was the lightening of PWS under treatment. PWS patients showed significant social phobia and avoidance similar to patient suffering from chronic skin diseases. The anxiety correlated with size and darkness of the PWS. In terms of helplessness and depressive mood, PWS patients were less affected than the comparison group. Also, PWS patients had reductions in quality of life and in body image. The coping strategies had a differential effect on the body image. Since there is a correlation between lightening of the PWS and reduction of emotional distress, FDPL therapy can be considered an effective treatment of PWS also in psychosocial terms.
