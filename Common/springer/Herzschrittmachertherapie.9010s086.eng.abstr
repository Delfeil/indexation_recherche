 Catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, the risks of catheter ablation have to bee weight against antiarrhythmic therapy. With catheter ablation AV-block III °, pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade (in some cases followed by death), arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described. Especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients. On the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown. The risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after mayocardial infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease.  It is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
