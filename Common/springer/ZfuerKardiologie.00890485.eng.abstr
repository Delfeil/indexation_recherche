 Angioplasty in acute coronary syndromes is complicated by a high rate of early vessel reocclusion and restenosis. Therefore, it is recommended to achieve a "stent-like" result by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or otherwise use coronary stenting (provisional stenting).   This study sought to determine angiographic and patient-related factors that are associated with early target vessel reocclusion or luminal renarrowing after coronary intervention in acute coronary syndromes (ACS).   In an observational prospective study we investigated 161 patients with ACS (acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina) submitted to PTCA. In 140 patients a follow-up angiography after 10 days was obtained. All angiograms were quantitatively evaluated by computerized measurements.   Target vessel reocclusion and early luminal renarrowing was observed in 10 patients (7.1%) and 19 patients (13.6%), respectively. Using univariate analysis, significant risk factors (P <0.05) for early reocclusion and renarrowing were diabetes mellitus (relative risk [RR] 6.1 and 5.0), arterial hypertension (RR 7.7 and 3.3), postprocedural lesion length >=2.5mm (RR 6.8 and 7.1), postprocedural minimal lumen diameter <=2.5 mm (RR9.0 and 5.8), residual stenosis >=25% (RR 4.8 and 3.5) and absence of stents (RR 4.1 and 3.2). Moreover, in multivariate analysis hypertension and postprocedural lesion length could be identified as independent risk factors for reocclusion and renarrowing. Diabetes mellitus was found to be an independent risk factor for renarrowing.   Conclusions: In a consecutive series of patients with ACS undergoing PTCA with provisional stenting the occurrence of early target vessel reocclusion and luminal renarrowing is lower than previously reported for this subset of patients treated by PTCA alone. Adverse outcome is related to absence of stents, angiographic factors (residual stenosis, lesion length, minimal lumen diameter after procedure) and patient-related factors such as diabetes and hypertension.
