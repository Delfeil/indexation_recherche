 In sexing of skulls the mastoid process is considered to be an important sex trait because of its greater dimension in males. Quantitative studies of the volume of the process are limited to air cell system investigations. The objektive of the present study was to quantify mastoid processes and test the value for sex determination. The three-dimensional study of the mastoid processes was carried out on 72 human skulls of which 38 were females and  34 males. The surface of the processes, limited to the part which projects from the skull base, was scanned with an optical measurement system. The resulting data were used to reconstruct virtual processes on a personal computer. Volume, suface area and height of the 3-D images were measured. There was no significant difference between the left and right mastoid processes. All of the parameters showed significant differences between the sex groups (volume: male 833.31 mm3, female 647.88 mm3, P = 0.04118; surface area: male 339.51 mm2, female  286.80 mm2, P = 0.0383; height: male 8.93 mm, female 8.06 mm, P = 0.0039). But the female values for volume and surface area were scattered completely within the male range and the female and male values for the height were widely overlapping. In discriminant function analysis the accuracy was only 65.28%. The results verify the sexual dimorphism of the dimensions of the mastoid processes but because of the widely overlapping range of male and female values the results are not of use for determination by measurement.
