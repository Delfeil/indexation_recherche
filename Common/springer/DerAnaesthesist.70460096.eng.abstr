Mivacurium has a short duration of action because it is rapidly hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase. There is ongoing controversy concerning the antagonism of mivacurium-induced neuromuscular block, firstly because of its short spontaneous recovery time, and secondly because the metabolism of mivacurium may be inhibited by anticholinesterases. We therefore compared neostigmine and edrophonium reversal of deep and moderate mivacurium-induced blocks.
