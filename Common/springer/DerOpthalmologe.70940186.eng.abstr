Background: Staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye. In addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found. According to Valenton und Okumoto, with this staphylococci-associated blepharo-kerato-conjunctivitis in culture-positive cases S. aureus is found in 31% and S. epidermidis in 69% of smears. Microbiallergic and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology.
