A study of verbatim transcripts of 47 psychotherapeutical assessment interviews. Four groups were examined: patients with neurotic depressions (n=11), patients with phobia and panic disorders (n=12), patients suffering from severe personality disorders (n=12), and patients with bulimia (n=12). The interviews were systematically evaluated by means of qualitative content analysis focussing on the following categories: subjective theories of illness, biography, and characterization of their own personality. As a result ideal types of self-description were found which also serve to reconstruct the determinants of the diagnostic process. Based on the patients' self-descriptions arguments could be developed for reducing the present confusing multiplicity of nosological concepts. One could arrive at a simpler system of broader diagnostic concepts in the field of neurosis and personality disorders which is more appropriate to the needs of clinical psychotherapy and psychotherapy research.
