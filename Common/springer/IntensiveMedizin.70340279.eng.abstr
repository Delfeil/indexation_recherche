 Intoxications with betablockers are common cases in emergency and intensive care medicine. Main symptoms are bradycardia, low blood pressure and neurological symptoms. The present study is based upon 244 intoxications with betablockers between 1986 and 1996. During childhood (age 1 - 5 years) an accidential intake of 1-2 tablets of a betablocker (max. 320 mg) does not cause any severe symptoms, hence the necessity of emesis and gastric lavage have to be considered cautiously. There is no correlation between ingested dose of the betablocker and expected symptoms, especially at higher doses when taken in a suicidal attempt. It is necessary to take into account preexisting diseases for examination of the expected grade of intoxication. The present study cannot give definite results about pharmacological properties and toxic effect of several betablockers. Considering the results of this study and from careful examination of the literature early detoxication and consequent clinical monitoring is recommendable. In case of clinical symptoms, as described above, drugs like dopamin and glucagon could be applied.
