High resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) and computed tomography (HR-CT) of the inner ear are becoming more important for the diagnosis of peripheral vestibular lesions. Modern HR-MRI techniques allow visualization of detailed anatomic features of the vestibulo-cochlear regions as well as pathologic findings in the inner ear such as, neoplastic lesions (e.g., small intracanalicular acoustic neuromas), anomalies causing vertigo and hearing loss (e.g. Mondini' s-malformation, perilymph fistula, vestibular paroxysmia), and inflammatory diseases (e.g., Cogan's syndrome, labyrinthitis, zoster neuritis). HR-CT is still the first examination that should be performed in patients with middle ear diseases (e.g., tumor, infection), trauma (e.g. temporal bone fractures), or fibro-osseous diseases. Although the imaging of the vestibulo-cochlear system has dramatically improved, there are still several peripheral vestibular disorders that cannot be visualized so far, e.g., benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo, idopathic vestibular neuritis or Menière's disease.
