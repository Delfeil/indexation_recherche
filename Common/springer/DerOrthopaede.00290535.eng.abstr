We report on three years of experience with a new method of a simultaneous endoscopically assisted anterior release in the prone position, combined with transpedicular posterior scoliosis correction and fixation. In 60 cases this simultaneous approach yielded substantial advantages. True derotation of the apex - even in the thoracic spine - is achieved.
