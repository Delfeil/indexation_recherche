Based on a short description of psychodynamic inpatient psychothearapy and behaviorally oriented therapeutic roleplays for the enhancement of social skills, an evaluation of a time-limited combination of both treatment approaches is presented. Results indicate that especially patients with high levels of social anxiety or a diagnosis of social phobia show clear improvement in measures of social-phobic symptomatology. Problems due to implementation of elements of cognitive-behavior therapy in a psychodynami- cally oriented treatment setting as well as an increase in acceptance of this combination within the therapeutic staff are discussed.
