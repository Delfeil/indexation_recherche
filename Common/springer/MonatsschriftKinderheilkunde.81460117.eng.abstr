A sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time. Both occasions were associated with menstruation. Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in the tracheal secretions once. Discussion: The etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described. The toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 acts as a superantigen in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. This case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar immunopathogenetic process.
