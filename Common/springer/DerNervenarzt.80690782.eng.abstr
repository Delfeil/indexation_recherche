A mental hospital and a psychiatric department of a general hospital in the region of Kassel have jointly analysed their basic documentation to produce an overview of hospital treatment of psychiatric patients in the region. Patients from the urban population occupy twice as many beds as those from the rural population which is a hint that standard bed-ratios per population are inadequate. Instead of the unsuitable official definition of duration of stay in hospital we used "days in hospital per person per year". Making allowance for groups of diagnoses this made possible interesting comparisons about the contributions of the two hospitals to the treatment of the psychiatric patients in the region. The two hospitals are not similar and the results show how the patients make use of the possibility of choosing the various specialities of the two hospitals.
