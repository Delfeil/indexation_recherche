Plaque-like glomus tumours are an unusual and very rare clinical form of multiple regional glomus tumours. We report on a 16-year-old girl with this variety of glomus tumours. The irregular angiomatous plaques localized on her back and right hip were present from birth and enlarged with body growth. In addition, there were some bluish nodules scattered on the right mamma, the abdomen and the left shoulder. The family history showed hereditary influences. The proper diagnosis was based on histological and immunohistochemical findings. In the present case report, the clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical features and the differential diagnosis of multiple plaque-like glomus tumours are discussed.
