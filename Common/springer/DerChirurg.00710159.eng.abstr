Abstract.  In vitro functions of stimulated peripheral T cells and monocytes were investigated in patients experiencing sepsis following major visceral surgery. Cell culture supernatants were analyzed by ELISA for IL-2, IFN-, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-12 p40. In addition, monocyte HLA class II expression was determined by flow cytometry. T cell secretion of IL-2, TNF-, and in part IFN- (but not IL-4) was significantly diminished in non-survivors throughout the entire course of sepsis, compared to controls and sepsis survivors. Production of IL-1 and IL-12 p40 by monocytes was strongly reduced in both survivors and non-survivors at the onset of sepsis. Persistence of depressed monocyte cytokine secretion correlated with lethality. Thus, overall suppression of cytokine production by T cells and monocytes was already observed at the beginning of postoperative sepsis. HLA class II expression by monocytes exhibited a strong and sustained down-regulation with no significant differences between sepsis survivors and non-survivors. In summary, suppression of both T cell and monocyte functions develops early during postoperative sepsis. Recovery of immune functions and severity of immune defects are associated with outcome.
