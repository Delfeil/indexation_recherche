 Noninterventional standard treatment measures for acute myocardial infarction in the ICU consist of routine care (medical examination; adequate bedding and bed rest; monitoring; venous access; oxygen and nitroglycerin therapy; analgesia; heparin), measures to reduce infarct size and thereby acute and long term mortality (acetyl salicylic acid; thrombolytics; betablockers; ACE inhibitors - at least in case of more severe pump failure) - and - finally - prophylaxis and treatment of infarct complications (heart failure, pulmonary oedema and cardiogenic shock; life-threatening bradycardias and tachycardias; ongoing myocardial ischemia), with consecutive reduction of immediate mortality. While calcium antagonists are no longer drugs of choice in patiens with myocardial infarction, intravenous magnesium and glucose-insulin-potassium solutions do not yet represent established treatment procedures in myocardial infarction. In case of right ventricular infarction and cardiogenic shock noninterventional treatment alone fails to reduce the high mortality; this may only be achieved by additional reopening of the infarct related coronary artery - mostly by coronary angioplasty - yielding a sufficient coronary flow.
