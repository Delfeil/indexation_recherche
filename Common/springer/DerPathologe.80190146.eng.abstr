Leiomyosarcomas of the spermatic cord are very rare tumours, which, in contrast to the rhabdomyosarcoms of childhood, occur almost exclusively in adults. We report the case of a 51-year-old male patient with a metastasizing, pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma of the spermatic cord. The tumour showed paraneoplastic secretion of beta-chain human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG), as was demonstrated by the elevated levels of -hCG in serum samples and by immunohistochemistry. Histologically, the tumour was a high-grade leiomyosarcoma which showed an aggressive course with pulmonary metastases appearing 4 months after primary surgery. A concomitant rise in the serum levels of -hCG was also noted at this time. A wide spectrum of tumours with a choriocarcinomatous component or paraneoplastic production of -hCG has been described, the vast majority being carcinomas. Only two leiomyosarcomas producing -hCG have so far been reported. The paraneoplastic production of -hCG should prevent confusion with germ-cell tumours, especially teratomas.
