 The guideline "Joint Swelling" is addressed to primary care physicians - general practitioners, internists or orthopedists without special experience in rheumatology. It provides a framework for interviewing patients, as well as for physical, laboratory and imaging examinations and for selection of treatment appropriate to the level of primary care. Situations which call for urgent evaluation and criteria for referral to rheumatologists are described. The appendix contains comments on signs and symptoms to differentiate arthralgia from joint swelling and on the diagnostic value of a history of joint swelling without confirmation by the physician. Further recommendations for the evaluation of patient history and physical and technical examinations are given in a tabular form. The significance of laboratory and imaging procedures is discussed.
