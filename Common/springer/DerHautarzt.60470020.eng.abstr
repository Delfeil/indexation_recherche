In a multicenter study, 100 patients with chronic urticaria were examined with a standardized personality test (Gieﬂen test), a standardized symptom questionnaire (Gieﬂener Beschwerdebogen) and a specially developed questionnaire concerning symptoms, history and behaviour during symptomatic periods. Almost one third of the patients showed elevated scores both for depression and for symptoms that are often associated with depression. It therefore seems worthwhile examining such persons more specifically and possibly treating them by psychosomatic methods. The present results do not allow the classification of chronic urticaria as a somatization disorder. Since one-third of the patients had symptoms of depression, combined dermatological and psychosomatic approach may make it possible to offer them an appropriately targeted treatment.
