Abstract.  A 69-year-old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non-small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus, pulmonary artery and left atrium. Staging examinations were negative. Using cardiopulmonary bypass, an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed. The cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch. The lower lobe was divided ex situ from the upper lobe and reimplanted with anastomosis of the lower pulmonary vein to the left auricle. After a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence 2.5 years postoperatively.
