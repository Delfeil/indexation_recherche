The introduction of flow-directed pulmonary artery (PA) catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology. There have been several developments of this equipment in recent years, including continuous monitoring of mixed-venous O2 saturation (Sv\=O2) and cardiac output (CO). The high purchase price, however, is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill. The aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to standardly used intermittent monitoring of Sv\=O2 and CO.
