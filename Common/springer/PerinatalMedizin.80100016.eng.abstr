Whether nitric oxide (NO) contributes to ischemic neuronal cell damage in the fetus independently of its effect on the vascular system is a matter of debate. To clarify this point we used a recently established hippocampal slice model. Postischemic alterations of energy metabolism and protein synthesis were taken as markers for neuronal cell injury. Methods: Mature (E 60) fetal guinea pigs (term is at 68 days) were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. Hippocampi were dissected out and cut into 500-µm slices. The slices were incubated in artifical cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), supplemented with 10 mM glucose and amino acids, and gassed with O2/CO2 (95%/5%) in a flow-through chamber for 90 min. Ischemia was induced by incubating slices for 10 - 40 min in glucose-free aCSF gassed with N2/CO2 (95%/5%). In one half of the slices NO synthase was blocked by 100 µM N-nitro-l-arginine (NNLA). Production of NO during in vitro ischemia was determined by measuring tissue levels of cGMP using a radioimmunoassay. Tissue levels of adenylates and protein synthesis were determined 12 h after in vitro ischemia. Adenylates were measured by HPLC after extraction with perchloric acid. Protein synthesis was determined as incorporation rate of l-[1-14C] leucine in tissue proteins. Significant differences within and between groups were assessed by a two-factor analysis of variance and Scheffé post-hoc test (P<0.005). Results: After 40 min of in vitro ischemia (I) the tissue concentration of cGMP increased significantly (control: 1.35 +/- 0.38 pmol/mg protein vs. I 40: 18.6 +/- 1.04 pmol/mg protein; P<0.05). The increase in cGMP during ischemia was almost completely inhibited by NNLA. The alteration of energy metabolism and protein synthesis 12 h after ischemia was not influenced by NO blockade. Conclusion: During in vitro ischemia there is considerable production of NO in the fetal brain. However, NO does not seem to play a major role in the development of ischemic neuronal cell damage independently of its effect on the vascular system.
