We report a case of visual loss and bilateral papilloedema under therapy with the antiarrhythmic substance amiodarone, which is used in treatment of refractory and life-threatening supraventricular and ventricular cardial tachyarrhythmias. After excluding intracranial hypertension, local tumors and an inflammatory genesis we consider this case to be an amiodarone-induced toxic opticusneuropathy. Amiodarone, a diiodated benzofuran derivative, is a cationic amphiphilic drug, which is able to cause ceratopathy and neuropathy. The rarely described and less known opticusneuropathy caused problems in differential diagnosis. A brief review about current knowledge of pathophysiology, differential diagnosis and course of illness is presented.
