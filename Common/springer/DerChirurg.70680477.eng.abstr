This article reviews the molecular basis of cell adhesion and its possible implications in surgery. Adhesion of circulating cells to endothelial cells is mediated by a variety of celladhesion molecules. The first steps in the celladhesion cascade (rolling, tethering) are regulated by selectins (P, E, L selectin). Stable adhesion and transmural migration predominantly involve integrins (LFA-1, etc.) and members of the immunoglobulin supergene family (ICAM-1, etc.). The mechanisms of leucocyte-endothelial interaction are markedly similar in various organs under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. However, it is likely that cell trafficing to specific tissues/organs (e.g., homing) is regulated by additional organ-specific, topical adhesion molecules (e. g., MAdCAM-1). In surgery, cell adhesion molecules are involved in organ-transplantation pathology (ischemia/reperfusion injury, rejection), inflammation (e.g., chronic inflammatory bowel diseases), tumor metastasis. Animal experiments with anti-adhesive substances show that blocking the leukocyte-endothelial interaction reduces the cellular inflammatory infiltrate and organ rejection. The transfer of experimental data into clinical practice requires further understanding of the regulators of cell adhesion (cytokines, chemoattractant substances, etc.) and the specificity of the process. Current experimental data suggest that early intervention in cell-adhesion mechanisms may offer innovative therapeutic strategies.
