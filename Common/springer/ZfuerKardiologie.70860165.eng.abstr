  Measurement of baroreflex sensitivity is a new method to identify patients after myocardial infarction with a high risk for sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. In this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a FINAPRES-device and correlating this with the R-R intervals of the ECG after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of Norfenefrinhydrochlorid (Novadral). According to other investigators a correlation of >0.7 with a significance of p<0.05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity <3 ms/mm Hg being judged as decreased. We investigated 302 patients (mean age 59 +/- 17 years, 224 males, 78 females). 75% of the investigations showed acceptable results. In 77 cases (25%) reasonable results could not be achieved. We found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in 18 investigations (6% of all investigations). 41 (13.1%) of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason. When we looked closely at these nonevaluable results, we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%), diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group.
