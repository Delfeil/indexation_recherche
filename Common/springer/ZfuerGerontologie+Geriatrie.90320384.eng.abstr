 The quest for postponing ageing has been in the mind of man since the earliest civilisations and the ancient symbols (healing water, herbs, sleep and the snake) are also found in the attempts undertaken today. Maximum life span, however, has not changed much due to these efforts. The rate of increase has been estimated to be about 10 year per million years. Mean life span has, on the other hand, increased dramatically, due to major environmental improvements, from about 30 to 80 years. Much of this increase is due to decrease in childhood and early adulthood mortality and has occurred during the last 130 years. Whether and to what extent this increase will continue is not clear.
