The age of standardized instrumented scoliosis correction and stabilization began with Harrington instrumentation (HI). With HI, satisfactory long-term correction of the frontal plane averaged approximately 50 %, but without notable derotational capabilities.The distraction of the concavity leads to reduction of the sagittal contour of the spine (flat back), which is biomechanically disadvantageous. The newer multisegmentally attached implant systems avoid this disadvantage. The first prototypes of these systems were Luque- (SSI) and Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation. Ideal indications for posterior instrumented curve correction are structural idiopathic double major curves and flexible single curves. However, even with these newer doublerod systems derotation is low, because derotation is, without any doubt, related to anterior release and thus decoupling of the segments by means of disc resection.
