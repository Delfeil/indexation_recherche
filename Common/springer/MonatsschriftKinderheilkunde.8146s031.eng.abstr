Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram-positive organism, which have in common a fermentative metabolism with lactic acid as the major end-product. Except for bifidobacteria, the LAB are phylogenetically closely related. They directly contribute to human well-being as they are the most important germs in the production process of fermented foods which constitute one fourth of our diet. They are, furthermore, an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora. The genus Streptococcus contains highly pathogenic species which can be clearly differentiated from the useful germs. The intestinal flora contains such species of the genus Lactobacillus that are also important in food fermentation and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore, can be found exclusively in this ecological niche. A special status characterises bifidobacteria and enterococci. The former are located in a separate phylogenetic branch and also occur virtually exclusively in the intestines. Enterococci are rather ubiquitous, participate in indigenous food fermentations, are found in the mucosal flora and are counted as opportunistic pathogens. To influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects LAB are isolated from the intestinal flora, grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or additions to food (usually fermented milk). These bacteria are termed "probiotics". The exposition of consumers to high numbers of germs belonging to one or a few species needs an evaluation of their safety for human health. In this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion. In front of this background, LAB in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe, nevertheless some restrictions have to be made. Generally, the germs used should not contain genes encoding transmissible resistance to antibiotics. In addition they should not produce biogenic amines (e.g. histamine, tyrosine or phenylethylamine) and should not degrade mucine. The assessment may also include the following: absence of a potential for deconjugation of bile salts, induction of platelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen and fibronectine. These examinations may be required as certain LAB have been identified in clinical isolates. The isolates were, however, obtained in the most majority of cases from debilitated patients. The germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment, organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated.
