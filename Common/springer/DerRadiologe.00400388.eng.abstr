A world wide homogenous level of knowledge for all members of an expert community is the proposed aim of academic education. The potential of the World Wide Web (WWW) with respect to under- and postgraduate education maybe accomplished if its use will become a definite part of cultural skills. Additionally, the process of simple collection of information should be added by the process of gaining knowledge and experience. Adaptation to the target group and a high degree of interactivity are the two main characteristics of high-quality technology-based learning materials. Considering both most of the web-ressources show deficits. Instructional design as well as information technology have means to overcome these deficits. With respect to the didactic principles of materials for beginners and advanced students, the architecture of computerised learning programs plays a significant role. However, costs to develop high-level learning materials is extremely high. Therefore it is necessary, to use synergetic effects with other digitized clinical and scientific materials.
