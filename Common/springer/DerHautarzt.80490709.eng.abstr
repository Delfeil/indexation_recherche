Background: Dermatologic surgery is usually possible under local anesthesia, even when large amounts of highly diluted anesthetic solutions are required (tumescent anesthesia). Although special pumps now render such large injections effortless, it is usually still necessary to hold and guide the injection cannula. We have overcome this handicap by injecting anesthetic solutions slowly with an Infusomat, which allows slow painless automatic infusion into the subcutaneous layer.
