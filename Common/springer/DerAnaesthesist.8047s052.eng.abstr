The low blood/gas solubility, the rapid uptake and nonpungent odor permits mask induction with sevoflurane in adults. Depending on the induction techniques (tidal breathing, deep breaths or single-breath induction), the use of nitrous oxide and the concentration of inspired sevoflurane anesthesia can rapidly be induced within 41-178 s. Adverse effects like coughing, breath-holding or increased secretions occur with a low incidence of 2%-20%. Some 88 to 100% of the volunteers or patients would accept a mask induction again. Clinical experience shows that sevoflurane is well indicated for mask induction in adults.
