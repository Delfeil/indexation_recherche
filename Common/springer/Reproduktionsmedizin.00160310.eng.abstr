Estrogens induce a pleiotropy of relevant neuroprotective effects. They occur via actions on vascular factors, on the metabolism of toxic free radicals, on the cholinergic system and on growth factor systems. Beside this, estrogens affect neurocellular phosphorylation, antiapoptotic proteins and the metabolism of Alzheimer's disease-related proteins, partly mediated by their "classical genomic receptors" and partly by other mechanisms. The available clinical and epidemiological database however, reveals no relevant effects (except for some verbal functions) in already demented patients and on normal neuropsychological symptoms of ageing. Whether estrogen treatment in earlier periods (e. g. perimenopause) or the endogenous hormone production reduce the risk of dementia in later life, is not clear yet. Pathophysiological interactions of a variety of biological, psychological and social factors must be taken into account. The article defines questions to be solved.
