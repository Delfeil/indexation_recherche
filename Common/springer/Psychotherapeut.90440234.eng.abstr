Psychotherapy research is a form of evaluation research. Two paradigms of evaluation can be distinguished: "comparative" and "non-comparative" evaluation studies. This differentiation is fundamental, since a study designed to answer a question concerning the non-comparative or "isolated" efficacy of a therapy cannot simultaneously serve to answer the question concerning the relative efficacy of two or more therapies aiming at the same goals or objectives - and vice versa. The reason for this lies in the fact that - in order to control for relevant interfering variables - comparison groups have to be investigated. Their selection depends on the particular question which is to be answered. Some consequences of this distinction are discussed, including the matter of necessary sample sizes.
