In times of reduced funds for health care expenditures, like other medical specialities, acute prehospital care is more often subject to total quality management. Structure, process and result quality must be continuously evaluated and improved. In the USA, Great Britain and Canada guidelines have been well accepted and established instruments in total quality management for many years regarding principles in diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients. After an overwhelming initial development of guidelines in Germany, the usefulness and advantages are now discussed critically. A lack of quality in comparison with international standards and concerns about the legal aspects endanger the acceptance and effective implementation of guidelines. In the field of prehospital emergency medicine, structured protocols such as guidelines or algorithms (e.g., for cardiopulmonary resuscitation) have been used for years now. Despite a variety of local attempts a national concept for Germany is still not reality. Guidelines in emergency medicine offer an opportunity to improve the quality of prehospital care, e.g. co-operation between physicians and EMS personnel. Nevertheless, the physician's freedom to choose in the area of therapeutic decisions cannot be touched by guidelines in any way. Therefore, new guidelines in prehospital emergency medicine in Germany must be scientifically well proven, based on a high level of real evidence, and continuously observed with strict clearing criteria in order to establish a system of total quality instead of total quantity management.
