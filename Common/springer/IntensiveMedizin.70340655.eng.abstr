 Gram-positive bacteria are increasing in importance as causes of hospital-acquired infections. Staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci are the aetiological organisms in up to 60% of nosocomial blood stream infections. Resistance to available antimicrobial agents is increasing and includes, in particular, resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (oxacillin and methicillin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin), lincosamides (clindamycin), and macrolides (erythromycin) amongst staphylococci, resistance to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) amongst enterococci, and resistance to penicillin and some other -lactams to pneumococci. This emergence of multiple bacterial resistance to various antimicrobial agents of different antibiotic classes now poses one of the most serious threat to our ability to treat patients. New antimicrobial agents for effective therapy of infection with antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive species are urgently needed. New compounds show high in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, especially against methicillin-resistant S. aureus or glycopeptid-resistant enterococci, and are under rapid development and clinical investigation. This review article summarizes the available data on the susceptibility of gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci to individual antimicrobial agents.
