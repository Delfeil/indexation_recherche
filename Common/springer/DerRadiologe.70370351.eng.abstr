Tumors of the heart are very rare. Due to the nonspecific clinical presentation the diagnosis is usually made by radiological procedures. Cardiac myxomas and thrombi are the most common cardiac masses. Two-dimensional echocardiography is the method of choice for the initial evaluation of cardiac tumors, because it permits the accurate determination of the tumor's size, localization, point of attachment, mobility and haemodynamic significance. Inadequate or nondiagnostic ultrasound examination and the need for preoperative assessment are indications for further examinations, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography. Both these methods are helpful in the assessment of paracardiac structures and of the tumor invasion into great vessels and the mediastinum. MRI allows a limited degree of assessment of whether or not the tumor is malignant by soft tissue characterization. In the case of resectable, symptomatic, cardiac tumors surgical excision should be performed.
