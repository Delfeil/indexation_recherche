 Interchange of information has become possible independent of the user's place or time by modern telemedical services and opens up new dimensions for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. For teleconferences and teleconsultations in surgery, the intraoperative high-quality transmission of live images is essential without disturbing the sterility and operation routine. The clinical specifications require special systems for broadband, stereoscopic online image transmission both intra- and inter-institutionally. Moreover, a telemedical concept integrates the communication equipment suitable for the different diagnostic and functional facilities of a clinic, a digital multimedia patient record and modules for cooperative working. These implementations are a prerequisite for extensive telesurgical interventions using navigational tools, guided instruments or autonomous roboter systems. The realization of such a comprehensive telesurgical concept (OP 2000) is presented.
