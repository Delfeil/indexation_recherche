 In a prospective study we investigated 168 patients with musculoskeletal tumors, including 71 sarcomas, by core needle biopsy using the high-speed device Autovac. Monitoring with colour-coded duplex sonography allowed a well-aimed puncture of smaller or deeply localized lesions and also permitted the discrimination of necrotic and viable parts of the tumor. Adequate material for histologic diagnosis including grading and determination of tumor subtype was obtained from soft tissue sarcomas, soft tissue metastases, malignant lymphomas, plasmacytomas, and osteolytic skeletal secondaries. In contrast, in benign soft tissue and bone tumors the diagnosis could be established in only 66 % of cases. Although skeletal sarcomas were identified as malignant mesenchymal lesions, a complete histologic classification of tumor subtype frequently was not possible due to an insufficient tissue specimen. With an accuracy of 97 % for the diagnosis of malignancy and of 94 % for the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma the results of core needle biopsies were comparable to those of incisional biopsies, the reference standard in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal tumors. Regarding the known disadvantages and the oncological risks of incisional biopsies, needle biopsy should replace the open procedure as the primary means of diagnosis in soft tissue and osteolytic bone tumors.
