HELLP syndrome is characterized by a high incidence of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. It is known that the clinical and biochemical course in patients with HELLP syndrome improves spontaneously after prompt termination of pregnancy. The disadvantages of this regimen is the high rate of prematurity before the 32nd gestational week. In contrast to the routine recommendations, 12 studies including 330 patients have demonstrated that pregnancy prolongation in patients with HELLP syndrome may offer certain advantages. There is evidence that glucocorticosteroids may affect the course of HELLP syndrome before and even after the pregnancies are terminated. In 8 out of the 12 studies steroids were at least administered in some of the cases. Nevertheless, only a single randomized and controlled study was performed that demonstrated an effect in patients treated with steroids as compared to non-steroid-treated HELLP patients. Several additional studies have shown that puerperal recovery in patients with antepartum HELLP syndrome is accelerated if steroids are given. In contrast to evidence of the benefit of steroids, another study has demonstrated pregnancy prolongation in HELLP patients without the administration of glucocorticoids. In the future additional extensive studies should define inclusion criteria for pregnancy prolongation in patients with HELLP syndrome. Furthermore, the effect of different existing therapeutic regimes - particularly the effect of steroids - on the course of pregnancies complicated by HELLP syndrome should be investigated.
