Artificial insemination from donor (heterologous insemination) is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility. In this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors, the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized. Although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy, most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not-identifiable information on biological and social characteristics. Semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population. The decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples. Retrospectively, however, the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership. The most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children. The course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural procreation. They receive more love and care than "usual" children. Their rights concerning the insemination, however, are poorly considered. If we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights, non-disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems.
