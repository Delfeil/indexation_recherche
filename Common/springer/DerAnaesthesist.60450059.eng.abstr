Portofemoro-axillary bypass systems are commonly used to treat adverse haemodynamic effects during the anhepatic phase of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). However, low shunt flows may reduce the efficacy of these bypass systems. In order to improve veno-venous bypass management, a percutaneous cannulation technique (PCT) was used to insert large-bore catheters (21 F) into the left femoral and subclavian veins. This study prospectively addresses the complications of the PCT in 195 adult patients undergoing 203 OLTs.
