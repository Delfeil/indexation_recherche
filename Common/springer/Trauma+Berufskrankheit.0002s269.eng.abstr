The increasing complexity of performance processes in medicine requires a quicker and more consistent flow of information, especially between health care sites that are far distant from each other. The Regensburg model, a realisation of lean telemedicine from the low-cost domain using PC-based standard videoconferencing systems, shows the use of modern telecommunications specifically in trauma surgery. In 203 prospectively evaluated teleconsultations with 15 persons taking part, a total of 6597 images were transmitted via videoconferencing. In 95% of the trauma cases concerned the material transmitted was judged to be at least sufficient. In an evaluation parallel to the project the efficacy of these systems and their benefit were clearly demonstrated. Savings of up to 4400 DM per case were achieved on transportation costs. The faster flow of information resulted in qualitative improvements for all parties concerned, and some considerable costs of health care were avoided or lowered. Based on these thoughts, a new communication platform will be established in Regensburg as a closed medical intranet for the administrative region of eastern Bavaria.
