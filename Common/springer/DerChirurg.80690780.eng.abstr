 We report the case of a 34-year-old woman with severe rectal bleeding since the age of 17. The cause of the bleeding was a cavernous haemangioma of the rectum. The extent of the disease was not realised for many years. Sclerosing injections, laser coagulation and even suture ligation were helpful in acute bleeding episodes but did not result in definitive healing. Finally cure was achieved by resection of the rectum and colo-anal sleeve anastomosis. The clinical presentation and the management are described and discussed.
