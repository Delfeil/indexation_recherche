Epinephrine (adrenaline) is an important drug in the treatment of severe anaphylactic reactions. Along with other drugs such as H1-antihistamines and glucocorticosteroids, it is found in every first aid kit for at-risk individuals, such as those who are allergic to insect stings. Subcutaneous or intramuscular injections if carried out by an untrained individual or the patient himself might give rise to potential problems. Therefore, it is common to prescribe epinephrine pressure aerosol as a safer alternative. If epinephrine aerosol is overused, it can cause serious problems. A patient developed by self-medication following a wasp sting lung edema as well as an erosive gastroduodenitis. She consumed two aerosol vials each of which contained about 73 mg of adrenaline.
