Objective: To investigate nasal airway changes through transverse maxillary distraction osteogenesis by means of an objective, reliable, non-invasive investigation technique with special attention to nasal valve changes and widening of the posterior maxilla. Patients and intervention: Eight patients with a severe maxillary transversal deficit underwent surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion in local or general anesthesia. Before and after the distraction process, a transnasal series of acoustic measurements of nasal airway profile was performed under topical decongestion. Nasal volume was calculated by integration of the area profile. The cross-sectional area of the nasal valve was also determined. Results: A significant enlargement of nasal volume was recorded in all patients (P < 0.01: Wilcoxon signed rank test). The average increase measured 5 cm3 (23%). The increase in volume was recorded in all parts of the nasal cavity, indicating complete maxillary expansion even in the posterior segment. The nasal valve area raised from 0.56 to 0.70 cm2 (P < 0.01). Six out of eight patients reported striking improvement of nasal patency after maxillary distraction. Conclusion: Besides correction of the maxillary arch deformity, rapid palatal expansion contributes to improved nasal patency by resolving nasal valve constriction. Significant widening of the posterior nasal cavity was achieved, indicating a translational pattern of maxillary movement, although the pterygomaxillary junction was not touched in the osteotomy.
