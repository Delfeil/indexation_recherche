Abstract.  Introduction: Although the effectiveness of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is proven, it is not used adequately. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether hospital-based guidelines are useful tools to improve the management of perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis. Material: In a retrospective study the actual quality of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis as given by the criteria choice of drugs, dosage, timing, continuation and 2nd dose after > 3 h was evaluated. After information and establishment of adequate guidelines we started a prospective analysis to test compliance and rate of adequate prophylaxis. Differences were calculated according to the 2-test with P < 0.05 significance niveau. Results: The percentage of cases in which antibiotics were indicated but not administered was reduced from 15.5 % to 8.4 %. Compared to the result of the retrospective analysis, the prospective study showed a significantly higher percentage of adequately administered antibiotics (35.7 % vs. 63.5 %). This was mainly due to the compliance with dosage recommendations and to the 2nd dose in longer surgical procedures. Discussion: Guidelines lead to a significant improvement in perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. To increase this effect, further approaches such as integration of guidelines into computer-based systems should be evaluated.
