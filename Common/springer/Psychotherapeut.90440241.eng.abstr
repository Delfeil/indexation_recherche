The paper describes the concept for a form of in-patient treatment for anxiety disorders based on a combination of psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral therapy which is currently still being applied as a model. We present the case history of one male patient with an anxiety disorder and in addition a severe personality disorder as an example of our therapeutic approach. The diagnose, according to the ICD-10 classification system is an agoraphobia with a narcistic and dependent personality disorder. The idea for a form of treatment based on a combination of behavioral and psychodynamic therapy is based primarily on the hypothesis that there is a subgroup of patients, still to be identified, who benefit more from an interrelated combination of both therapeutic approaches than from one therapy alone. As far as the psychodynamic component is concerned, the 12-week combination treatment essentially comprises a highfrequency group therapy with a psychodynamic orientation and a distinct focus of treatment. The behavioral therapy is conducted in an individual setting with co-therapeutic support and consists of an exposure and response prevention as the central component of treatment. A significant and steady improvement in the goal symptoms was achieved in the patient in the course of treatment. In addition to a concrete description of the therapeutic approach, the paper provides psychometric evaluation data, including an eighteen-month catamnesis.
