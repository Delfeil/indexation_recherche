The arthroscopic extraarticular Bankart procedure tries to imitate the open Bankart procedure. An anterior-inferior transmuscular approach through the subscapular muscle permits to implant self-locking tacks into the anterior inferior third of the glenoid rim. The extraarticular location of the implants makes a superomedial capsular shift possible, if required. A total of 257 arthroscopic repairs following traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation have been carried out between 1992 and 1996. 177 patients were treated only with bioabsorbable Suretac device. Clinical and radiological follow up was possible in 165 patients. According to the Rowe score 69,7 % were classified as excellent, 10,9 % as good, 9,7 % fair and 9,7 % poor. Postoperative complications: the recurrence rate was 9,7 %, allergic reactions representing a foreign body reaction to the synthetic material were seen in 5 cases (3 %) and a frozen shoulder in 6 cases 3,6 %). 61 % of the patients involved in overhead or contact sports returned to their preoperative sport activities.
