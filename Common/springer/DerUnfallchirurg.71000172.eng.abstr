Owing to advances in adjuvant therapy, the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades. This applies both to improved survival and to increased limb salvage rates. The diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined. Technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures, such as Tikhoff-Linberg resection at the shoulder, internal hemipelvectomy, proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented. The use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures. In the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk-adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery.
