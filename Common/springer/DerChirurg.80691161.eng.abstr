 Post-traumatic malalignment can occur on one or several planes following fractures in close proximity to the knee joint. In a clinical and radiological analysis of deformities, the frontal, sagittal and longitudinal alignment, as well as differences in femoral or tibial length and torsion, must be taken into account. The location of the correctional osteotomy is usually defined by the center of the angular and torsional deformity. Of decisive importance when choosing the site of the osteotomy are the local quality of bone and the soft tissue envelope, the condition of the articular cartilage in the different compartments of the knee, the stability of ligamentocapsular structures and preexistent deformities of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Therefore, the location of correctional osteotomies must be modified, depending on the individual situation. The appropriate approach and technique must be chosen from the different available operative techniques. Inaccurate planning and inappropriate operative techniques pose severe risks. Specific postoperative complications are compartment syndromes, nerve irritation and infection.
