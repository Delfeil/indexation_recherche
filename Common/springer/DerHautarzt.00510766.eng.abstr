Verrucous carcinomas represent rare, highly differentiated variants of squamous cell carcinoma. They preferentially develop on the oropharyngeal mucosa (Ackerman tumor), the urogenital mucosa (Buschke-Loewenstein tumors), and the soles of the feet (epitheliomata cuniculata). Various synonyma have been coined for these tumors. We report the uncommon occurrence of a large verrucous carcinoma on apparently uninvolved chest skin of a 79-year old patient. The tumor was excised radically. Complete extirpation was confirmed histologically and there was no sign of recurrence during a 3 month observation period. The clinical appearance, histomorphological features, epidemiological aspects, differential diagnosis, therapy, and nomenclature of verrucous carcinomas are discussed.
