To get an idea on the compliance of our patients treated with growth hormone and on any problems relating to therapy administration we conducted an anonymous questionnaire in 204 patients/parents. 174 evaluable forms (85 %) were returned to us. The acceptance of treatment turned out to be satisfactory: 91 % of the families found the therapy practicable, but 15 % of mothers and 10 % of fathers expressed doubts on its effectiveness. 36 % of the families admitted to having left out injections occasionally. 88 % of the reasons offered for non-compliance were banal and unserious, and in only 6 % were there suggestions for therapy improvement indicating the need for more education and instruction. Thus, the day-to-day inconvenience appears to be an important aspect restricting therapy compliance. The intense medical care and education of patients and their families is essential in improving their compliance with treatment.
