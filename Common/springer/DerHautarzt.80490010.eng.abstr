A rising incidence worldwide of skin cancer has been observed for years. A high cumulative exposure to UV radiation is a major factor in the development of such neoplasms. Suitable protective measures are therefore becoming increasingly important. Textiles provide simple, effective and medically safe protection against UV radiation. At present, however, in Europe - in contrat to Australia - the UV protection factor (UPF) for summer textiles is not stated. It is a largely unknown fact that by far not all textiles offer sufficient protection. Our goal was to study the factors which determine the UV transmission of fabrics and, based on these findings, to design materials which provide enhanced protection. A spectrophotometric method was used to determine the UV transmission by fabrics made of cotton, silk, polyester and viscose. The UV protection factors of the fabrics were computed on the basis of the transmission data. The UV protection factor is dependent on the type of fibre, yarn and surface design, weight per square metre, moisture content, colour, finishing method and degree of wear. To optimize the UV protection via textiles, a viscose yarn with a low UV transmission was used. This yarn makes it possible to design light-weight summer fabrics with optimized UV protection. This development will make it possible to offer clothing with high UV protection on the European marked. This clothing will not be more expensive than normal products, so that effective prevention should be more available.
