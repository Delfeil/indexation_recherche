 According to the growing clinical interest in early indicators of dementia, numerous studies have examined the association between subjective memory complaints and cognitive performance in old age. Their results are contradictory. In this paper, studies carried out over the last 10 years are compared with regard to the study design and the assessment instruments used. The results are discussed with particular reference to the diagnostic validity of subjective memory complaints. The majority of case-control studies and cross-sectional studies of non-representative samples could not demonstrate an association between subjective memory complaints and cognitive performance. Most field studies of larger representative population samples, however, have come to the opposite conclusion. A consistent assessment of these statistically significant associations against the background off diagnostic validity showed that memory complaints cannot be taken as a clear clinical indicator for cognitive impairment. Subjective memory complaints may reflect depressive disorders and a multitude of other processes, of which an objective impairment of cognitive performance is just one aspect. As a consequence, an inclusion of subjective memory complaints as a diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of "mild cognitive disorder" according to ICD-10 is not justified.
