The mortality of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is still above 50% despite continuous progress in intensive care medicine. Recent therapy regimens such as the extra corporeal life support (ECLS), permissive hypercarbia, high-frequency ventilation techniques and inhaled nitric oxide (NO) are being applied. All of the above techniques are aimed at different parts of the problems caused by ARDS. This study was designed to evaluate the possible additive benefits of superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) and inhaled NO.
