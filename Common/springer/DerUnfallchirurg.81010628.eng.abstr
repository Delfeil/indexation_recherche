The infection after intramedullary nailing is a severe complication, which is hard to eradicate. The results of reaming the intramedullary canal after removal of the infected nail were evaluated in our investigation. From 1984 to 1991 fifty-five patients with infected intramedullary nails of the lower extremity were included in this trial. Twenty-one patients had an infection of the femur. Thirty-four patients had a primary infection of the nail, twenty-one patients had multiple operations with periods of infection prior to nailing. All patients had signs of a chronic osteitis and sinus formation. At the time of the follow-up the success of the procedure was evaluated regarding recurrence of infection, range of motion of the extremity and patient comfort. The mean time of observation was 10,1  +/-  4,9 years. All patients with initially infected intramedullary nails had no recurrence of the infection, compared to 62 % of those with multiple operations prior to nailing. At the time of the follow up all fractures had healed. 85 % of the patients performed full weight bearing. 32 patients (91 %) had good or excellent ROM of the adjacent joints.
