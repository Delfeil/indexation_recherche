 The head-space method has commonly been employed as a reliable method for the analysis of ethanol and other volatile drugs and poisons. The pulse heating method is characterized by the following advantages: 1) Analysis can be performed with small samples (1 µl), 2) pretreatment is not required, 3) requires little time, 4) gives exact measurements. Volatile substances can be isolated and identified within 15 min and thermal decomposition has not been observed. Toxicological screening of volatile substances was performed on 452 samples from 280 emergeny patients using the pulse heating method. The pulse heating method could clearly be shown to be useful for the analysis of volatile substances and could be used as an emergency toxicological screening system and for the quantitative analysis of clinical samples obtained from medical emergencies and forensic autopsies.
