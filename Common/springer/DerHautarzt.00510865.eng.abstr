Cystic tumors of the neck are usually cysts, inflamatory masses, lymph nodes, benign and malignant tumors or metastases. Malformations are less common. Ectopic salivary tissue is a rather rare but clinically important malformation. Accessory and aberrant tissue can be identified histologically. There may be an association with lymphatic tissue. Possible complications include inflammation as well as the development of benign and in rare cases malignant salivary gland tumors. We report on two patients who underwent surgical treatment under the tentative diagnosis of epidermal cysts which histologically turned out to be ectopic parotid tissue.
