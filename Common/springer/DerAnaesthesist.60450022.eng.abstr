Due to its low blood:gas partition coefficient (0.69) and its neutral odor, sevoflurane (S) is suitable for inhalational induction of anaesthesia. At the moment halothane (H) is preferentially used for this purpose due to its non-irritating odor and the smoothness of anaesthetic action. However, experience is limited with the use of S in children, and concern exists about potential renal toxicity of its metabolite, i.e. fluoride. Therefore, we compared S and H in an open, randomized phase III trial.
