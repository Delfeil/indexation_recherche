Sevoflurane is a viable alternative to propofol and desflurane for both induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia in the ambulatory setting. As a result of sevoflurane's lack of respiratory irritant properties, it provides for a smooth induction and prompt emergence from outpatient anaesthesia. In addition, the relatively low incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting facilitates "fast-tracking" after ambulatory surgery. Although no single anaesthetic agent is ideal, when sevoflurane is combined with other adjunctive drugs it can produce excellent surgical conditions for a wide variety of ambulatory surgical and diagnostic procedures.
