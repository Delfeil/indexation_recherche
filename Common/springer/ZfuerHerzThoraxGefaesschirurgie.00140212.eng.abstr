 Leiomyosarcomas of the heart and great vessels are extremely rare and highly lethal diseases. Diagnosis is difficult due to their unspecific symptoms, which are frequently confused with other clinical conditions such as pulmonary embolism.   This report describes a 31-year-old man with leiomyosarcoma of the pulmonary artery originating at the pulmonary valve and involving right ventricular outflow tract and central pulmonary arteries. Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical therapy has led to long-term survival; five years after the operation the patient is alive and disease free. The importance of a timely diagnosis and radical surgical excision is delineated and a review of the literature included.
