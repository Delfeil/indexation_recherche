Abstract.  This study investigated multiple trauma patients, who were injured between 1991 and 1995 and treated in our department. The aim of this study was to identify the determinants of quality of life after multiple trauma. From a total of 186 patients 173 (93 %) were examined. The patients were asked to rate their quality of life according to the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and to a visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS and the NHP isolated the age of the patients, the duration of artificial respiration, and the duration of rehabilitation as the predictors for a reduced overall quality of life. These results show that quality of life after multiple trauma not only depends on the severity of injury but also on demographic and psychosocial factors.
