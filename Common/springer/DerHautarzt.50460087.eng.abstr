Abstract.  In 77 patients with port-wine stain under 18 years of age we performed 100 test treatments with the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (585 nm, 450 µs, 5 mm beam diameter). In 54% of cases we could obtain excellent or good lightening with one test treatment. In only 9% of cases did the patients show bad or no response to laser therapy. In the following treatment of larger areas (n=125), the rate of good or excellent lightening was even higher (60%). Side effects were infrequent and consisted mostly of transient hyperpigmentation. In contrast to argon laser therapy, the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser is safe and effective for treatment of port-wine stains in childhood and adolescence. Our results and the good results reported in the literature confirm the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser as the laser of choice for port-wine stain treatment in young patients.
