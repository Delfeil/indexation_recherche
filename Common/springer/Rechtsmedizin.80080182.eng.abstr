 Platelets from corpse blood samples (n = 77) taken during the first 9 h post mortem (repeated collections in 1 or 2 h intervals) were stimulated in vitro with collagen, arachidonic acid, ADP, epinephrine or by agitation. Activatable platelets released endogenically stored serotonin upon adequate stimulation. The plasma serotonine concentration was measured by means of an immunoassay and is a direct measure of functional platelet status. Results: The platelets in corpse blood can initially (up to 3 h post mortem) be activated differentially depending on the type and concentration of the agonists. By the 6th hour post mortem, platelets lose their capacity to react adequately with a release reaction. Later, the secretive capacity of the platelets disappears completely.
