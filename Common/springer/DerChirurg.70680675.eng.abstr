 Immunosuppressive therapy and its influence on perioperative pathophysiology present special challenges in the event of surgical intervention. Immunosuppressive agents alter the patient's response to surgical stress and infectious complications. The often masked signs, even in the case of severe infection, require a high index of suspicion to establish the diagnosis. This may result in a fatal delay of therapy. In addition, the immunosuppressed state increases the patient's susceptibility to infection and leads to an impairment of wound healing. Therefore, careful perioperative clinical monitoring of the patient and complete control of the immunosuppressive therapy are mandatory. Elective operations in immunosuppressed patients should be performed with special caution regarding the potential perioperative risks for the patient and the graft. On the other hand, if there is evidence of, for example, an acute abdominal event, a more aggressive approach is required to rapidly establish the diagnosis and institute appropriate therapy. From the surgical point of view, special emphasis should be placed on wound closure and on anastomotic sutures when operating on a patient receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
