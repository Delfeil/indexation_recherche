Abstract.  Introduction: The most common benign ampullary tumors are adenomas (80 %). They are considered as premalignant lesions with a transformation rate to carcinoma of up to 30 %. Methods: From 1 January 1997 to 28 February 1999 we treated 11 patients with adenoma of the ampulla of Vater. An ampullectomy was performed in 10 cases. One poor-risk patient could not be operated on. Results: No operative mortality occurred. In two patients a pT1 adenocarcinoma was diagnosed postoperatively. One of the two patients with a high-risk carcinoma underwent a second operation, a Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy. Nine of 10 patients had no recurrence with a median follow-up of 12 months. Conclusion: One patient died of glioblastoma. We would therefore recommend ampullectomy as the first-line treatment for benign tumors of the ampulla of Vater. In low-risk pT1 carcinoma (G1/G2, L0) and R0 resection, local excision is acceptable. In high-risk pT1 carcinoma (G3 and/or L1) Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy is mandatory.
