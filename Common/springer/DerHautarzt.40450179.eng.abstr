Abstract.  In Schönlein-Henoch purpura, a distinctive form of leucocytoclastic vasculitis, immune complex deposits in vessel walls characteristically contain IgA. Complement activation, neutrophil chemotaxis and the subsequent destruction of vessel walls make up the pathologic substrate behind the clinical symptoms, which are characterized by palpable purpura lesions, renal and gastrointestinal symptoms and arthralgias. Viral infections, malignant neoplasms and drugs, but especially streptococcal infections, are incriminated as possible causes of the disease. A case of Schönlein-Henoch purpura associated with chronic osteomyelitis is described. It is noteworthy insofar as there is only one similar case reported in the literature.
