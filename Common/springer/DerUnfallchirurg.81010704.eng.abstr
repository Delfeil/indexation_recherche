Simple bone cysts are asymptomatic, benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph. Etiology and treatment are controversially discussed. The weightbearing status of the calcaneus and possible pathologic fracturing lead many authors to recommend therapeutic measures after diagnosis has been made. We present a case report of an intact unicameral bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma. Several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested. The question whether treatment is unconditionally necessary is controversially discussed. It is the author's opinion, that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment.
