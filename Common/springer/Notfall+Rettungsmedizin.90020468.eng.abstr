The organizational and legal aspects of emergency medicine have not kept pace with recent technological advances in mobile communication. However, telemedicine applications have the potential to significantly improve processes in the field of emergency medicine through rapid recording and processing of information. Numerous uses of telematics in emergency medicine can be determined through economic analyses of current situations and by identifying shortcomings in emergency treatment and quality management. Many projects that involve telematic devices for prehospital emergency management (e.g. home monitoring, automatic emergency call systems, telematic support systems for dispatch centers, and mobile applications for emergency transportation systems) have reported impressive effects. It is now our task to further specify shortcomings, articulate the substantial requirements, evaluate and integrate successfully tested components into a fully functional system.
