During the past 15 years urologists have acquired a widespread knowledge on physiology and pathophysiology of male erectile dysfunction and consequent etiology-based therapies. The same period was characterized by a profound change of sexual behavior and public appearance of sexual issues. On the other hand the socio-demographic effects of prolonged life-span and reduced socio-economic resources for reimbursement of medical therapies become visible. Sexology of aging men is an interdisciplinary research field; its scientific results should be included into therapeutic decisions in impotent patients. Especially in recognition of our new treatment options such as oral sildenafil, a partner- and libido-oriented sexual counseling should accompany somatic therapy in most of our elderly patients. There exists no general "sexology of the aging male" but rather an individual sexual behavior and self-understanding that is transported into senescence. "Zeitgeist"-phenomena, partner problems and age-dependent physiologic changes can coincide and potentiate the resulting sexual dysfunction. Modern therapeutic plans should recognize these facts and create behaviour- and partner-oriented counseling strategies combined with minimally invasive somatic approaches.
