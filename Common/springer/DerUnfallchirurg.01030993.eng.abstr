Stress fractures occur in 13.2-37.0% in running athletes. There is a decreasing incidence of these fractures in the tibia (33%), navicular (20%), metatarsus (20%), femur (11%), fibula (7%) and pelvis (7%). Clinically stress fractures present themselves with uncharacteristic local pain under weightbearing conditions. In 75% the medial tibial crest is involved. Usually the pain disappears when the patient is non-weightbearing. As causal factors wrong training methods, oligomenorrhoe (6 x incidence), low nutrition input (8 x incidence) and a genu recurvatum-morphotype can be found.
