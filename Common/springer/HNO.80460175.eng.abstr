Metastatic lesions represent 1-8% of all malignant tumors of the mouth and jaws, with rare sites of metastasis originating from different primary tumors, especially the lung and breast. The vast majority of these lesions (up to 90%) have been observed in the mandible and maxilla (5-20%). Another rare type of cancer that usually metastasizes to the lungs, lymph nodes, bones, liver or brain may occasionally also show spread to the paranasal sinuses. In the present paper we report our management of a 5-year-old male with renal cell carcinoma who developed metastases to the frontal and ethmoid sinuses.
