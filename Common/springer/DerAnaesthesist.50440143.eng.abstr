The safety of blood and blood components is an important aspect of transfusion medicine. Even if absolute safety of blood products cannot be achieved, this goal has come closer due to significant improvements. These include: (1) exact donor registration; (2) component preparation according to legal requirements and GMP guidelines; (3) determination of all relevant diagnostic parameters according to GMP/GLP guidelines; (4) adequate storage of products; and (5) an often underestimated parameter ensuring safety, strict guidelines for the use of blood products in the treatment of patients. Some of the results of the first Graz Consensus Conference on Transfusion Medicine are presented.
