In recent years, mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease. However, since October 1994 a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed. At four hospitals in the Saarland, Germany, 45 cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period. In addition to the case history and clinical findings, the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased IgM titer. None of the patients had been previously vaccinated. The main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination, one which has almost no side effects. The goal of this study is to describe the disease, present our own results, and indicate the need for vaccination. In addition to providing information, a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination. Although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years, the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination.
