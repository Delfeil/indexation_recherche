The analysis of THR-failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement. The acetabular cup fails more often than the stem. In the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups. The known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases exponentially 8 to 10 years after implantation, could of course not be seen in this study. The success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, age over 70 and the fixation manner: the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of pressfit cups although the Zweymüller-cup as well as the Link type V-cup showed good results. The midterm results of the stem were very good for the cementless as for the cemented technique. Some implants showed compared to others significantly worse results. The further implantation should be thought of, what partially has already happened. The results of cementless stem fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis and dysplastic osteoarthritis is comparable, so that cementless fixation should be thought of in case of adequate conditions (ability of partial weight bearing for some weeks, age under 60).
