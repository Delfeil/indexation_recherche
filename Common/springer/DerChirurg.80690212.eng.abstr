 Methods: In a 300-bed acute-care hospital we compared optical instruments employed, for orthopedic, urological and gynecological operations during their use in practice. The comparison between 33 ethylene oxide(EO)-sterilized optical instruments and 14 steam-sterilized optical instruments took into account the following criteria: frequency of use; availability; sterilization cycles; kind, cost and number of repairs. Results: The 33 EO-sterilized optical instruments were handled 1043 times and were repaired 10 times (at a cost of up to 2000 SFR). The 14 steam-sterilized optical instruments were treated 1101 times and were repaired 8 times (2000 SFR). The total costs were 77 000 SFR for the 14 steam-sterilized instruments and 132 000 SFR for the 33 EO-sterilized instruments. Interpretation: Steam-sterilization is a reasonable, safe and fast method of sterilizing optical instruments. We prefer this method, given its advantages (less toxicity, personal care and pollution control).
