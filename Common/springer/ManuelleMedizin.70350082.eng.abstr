A new bed, designed to fit physiological demands, was investigated in a controlled polysomnographic study in six middle-aged chronic insomniacs. Compared to a hospital bed, sleeping in the experimental bed yielded a number of significant sleep improvements. Normalization of the sleep maintenance function resulted in an increase in sleep duration by 1 h, an effect comparable to that of modern hypnotics. The different sleep stages showed a parallel, physiological increase. In the first study of this kind, it was possible to demonstrate the importance of the bed construction for the sleep of insomniacs.
