  In a 64-year-old male patient with severe angina pectoris (CCS III) a systolic compression caused by a coronary muscle bridging in the left anterior descending artery could be detected by coronary angiography. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) as well as intracoronary Doppler examination showed a significant systolic reduction of the cross-sectional luminal area of 35.9% and a reduced coronary flow velocity ratio (CFVR) or 2.6.
