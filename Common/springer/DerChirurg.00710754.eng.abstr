Abstract.  Deep wound infection of the abdominal wall and postoperative abdominal wound rupture are dangerous complications of laparotomy that require emergency operative intervention. The wound infection quota after laparotomy is between 5 and 10 %. While subcutaneous infections heal without consequences after wound treatment, deep infections of incisional wounds are a problem. The cause is often an intra-abdominal infection. There are some standard operational measures: consistent debridement of the necrotic parts, careful reexploration of the intra-abdominal site and early fascial closure with special sutures. All other procedures depend on the individual case. Abdominal wall rupture only occurs in 1 % of the cases, but the mortality is high (15-45 %). Besides local wound factors and the technical aspects, there a many general causes. Abdominal wall rupture also requires emergency operation. Repeated wound closure without further steps is possible in half of the cases. The mass technique should be used. Both deep wound infections and rupture are important complications in the development of incisional hernias.
