 The present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding (PET) in the conjunctivae and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation. In a series of 473 autopsies the over all occurrence of PET was 13.3%. The highest frequencies were found in fire victims (31%), persons who had died after intensive care (24%), cardiac death (22%), drowning and intoxication (16% each). The frequency of PET decreased with increasing age and increased with the body mass. At first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) seemed to influence the occurrence of PET, because the rate was 11% without and 19% with CPR (x2: p < 0.05); an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature. However, further analysis showed that a higher rate of PET could only be observed in causes of death where PET are often fround irrespective of CPR, whereas in the other groups PET (with or without CPR) are uncommon. Furthermore, a case-by-case analysis showed that in several cases with PET after CPR the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than CPR. In a second series of autopsy cases with only cardiac deaths (181 cases), the influence of age and body mass on the rate of PET was statistically significant and there was a tendency for more frequent PET with increasing heart weight. On the other hand, no statistically significant influence of CPR on the rate of PET could be found in this relatively homogeneous group.
