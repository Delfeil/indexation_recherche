Polydactyly may be preaxial or tibial (halluxside), postaxial or ulnar (side of the little toe) and central (middle toes). The duplication may appear at the distal and medial phalanges or at the whole digit. The metatarsal bone may be partwise or completely duplicated, the accessory toes may share only one metatarsal. Surgical intervention may be indicated in shoeproblems, for esthetic reasons or, especially in duplication of the metatarsales, because of secondary deviation of the toes and therefore shoeproblems or plantar callosities. Preoperative analysis including x-ray is of great importance to achieve good functional and cosmetic results.
