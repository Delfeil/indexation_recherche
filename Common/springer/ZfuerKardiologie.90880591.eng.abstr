 Endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis. The aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) release following a local endothelial injury during PTCA (group A) and after sustained myocardial ischemia (group B). Additionally, the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed.
