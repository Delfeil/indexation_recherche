On 90 patients with 93 unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may 1996 and april 1998, in 46 patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed. The diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining costal base. After partial corporectomy and discectomy, a tricortical bone graft has been inserted. An additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system. The incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal endostapler. Controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by X-ray and CT-scan. There was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection. Splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures.
