 Inflammation-mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation. We found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process, in addition cytokines are increased. Treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation.
