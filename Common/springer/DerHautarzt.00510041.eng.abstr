Cutaneous metastases from a leiomyosarcoma of the testicular tunica albuginea are very rare. Primary leiomyosarcomas in this site are uncommen and furthermore cutaneous metastases develop only in 1,4% of all malignant tumors of the internal organs [10]. A 71 year old patient with such a sarcoma underwent primary excision. Nine months later multiple, firm, nodules were identified as cutaneous metastases. Further staging revealed already extensive, diffuse pulmonary and bony metastases without contiguous or regional lymph node involvement.
