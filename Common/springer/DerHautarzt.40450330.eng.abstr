 We report on a 31-year-old white woman, who was bitten in her right calf by a "spitting cobra" (Neia nigricollis) during a safari in Tansania. Minor initial systemic symptoms such as nausea and vomiting were followed by severe oedematous swelling of the extremity after 2 - 3 h and demarcation of a 2.75x2.75 in. area of necrotic skin. The patient returned to her home country, where 8 days after the snake-bite necrosectomy was performed. Antibiotics, antiinflammatory agents and local therapy with hydrocolloidal wound dressings were administered. With this therapy the lesion healed completely with minor scarring within 5 months. A new Salmonella strain was isolated from the ground of the ulcer.
