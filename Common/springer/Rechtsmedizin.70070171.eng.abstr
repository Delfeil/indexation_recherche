 Intoxication is the monotone reaction of the CNS to consumed psychoactive substances. Intoxication-like conditions may also occur without taking drugs. We then use the term "ecstasy". Intoxication can follow typical or atypical course. The main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood, affect, drive and initiative, train of thought and self-control. The diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course, occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication.
