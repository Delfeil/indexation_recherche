Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) can determine the true volumetric bone density of trabecular and cortical bone separately and at any skeletal site. QCT, because of its sensitivity to changes in bone status, is widely accepted as the superior method for the axial skeleton because of the high responsiveness of spinal trabecular bone to osteoporotic changes. The precision and accuracy of QCT at this site are somewhat lower than the respective values of other densitometric techniques. Nevertheless, because QCT measures a higher rate of bone loss at early premenopausal age, it allows better estimation of risk of vertebral fracture and smaller time intervals between follow-up measurements. The clinical acceptance of QCT is constrained by limited access to CT scanners for bone densitometry, the higher degree of operator dependence and the inability of QCT to measure the femur. New developments currently in scientific trial show that using volumetric CT can increase precision of QCT at the spine and allow highly accurate, precise and meaningful measurements at the femur.
