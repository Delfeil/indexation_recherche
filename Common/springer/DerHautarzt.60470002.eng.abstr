The eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions. Swelling - often oedematous - is a frequent symptom. This publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short characterisations of possible causes. The subjective complaints of the patient charts (pain, pruritus) are shown to be important criteria for orientation. Special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling.
