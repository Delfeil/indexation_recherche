After some introductory remarks about the traumatizing experience many parents have after the birth of a very small preterm baby (<= 1500 g), a developmental risk model is presented. This is the basis for an early beginning preventive psychotherapeutic intervention. In the Ulm Study the comprehensive parent-centered intervention program includes insight oriented focal individual psychotherapy, supportive group psychotherapy, a home visit and a video-based sensitivity training. The intervention aims to improve parental coping, the process of attachment and parent-infant interaction. The theoretical implications, the design and the methods of this prospective randomized longitudinal study will be discussed.
