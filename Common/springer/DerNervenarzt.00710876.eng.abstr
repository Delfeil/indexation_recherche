The assessment of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is complicated by poorly defined diagnostic criteria and a lack of valid instruments. The present pilot study examines the possible benefit of specific instruments in the discrimination of other body image disorders. Thirteen patients with BDD, 13 with disfiguring defects, and 21 with no significant impairment of appearance participated in the study. The participants were recruited from dermatological outpatients on the basis of semistructured diagnostic interviews and clinical ratings of disfigurement. Furthermore, structured interviews were conducted to determine comorbidity with depressive disorders and social phobia and to obtain a clinical rating of obsessive-compulsive symptoms using the modified version of the YBOCS for body dysmorphic disorders. In addition, the Beck depression inventory, the Social Phobia Scale, and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale were completed. Patients with BDD differed significantly from disfigured and unimpaired patients in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, in particular obsessions, and the discrepancy between personal and clinical rating of disfigurement. However, depression and social phobia scores were only higher in comparison with unimpaired patients. Comorbidity with depressive disorders was significantly increased. Our results support the utility of the specific diagnostic instruments and indicate the particular importance of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in BDD.
