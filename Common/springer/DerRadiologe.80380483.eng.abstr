Malignant bone tumors require the same careful staging as, for example, lung cancer. However, well-established staging systems for non-osseous tumors are not suitable for bone tumors. Therefore we present Enneking's staging system for malign bone tumors here, which is better adapted to the special problems of these entities because it integrates clinical, radiological and histological findings. The weak points of Enneking's staging system (e.g. inflexibility, changes in radiological modalities in the past 20 years) are discussed.
