After two years clinical experience using an open 0,5 T - MRI, which make it possible to control all steps of a brain tumor resection, the high expense in relation to the effect is proofed. In 80 MRI-guided brain tumor resections the indication, the degree of resection, the appearance of operative induced changes, complications and clinical state are analysed. The advantage of the method consists in safety of localisation and detection especially of intraaxial cerebral tumors, recording of intraoperative invisible tumor parts and saving eloquent areas during tumor resection. To have optimal results, all over the operation time, the participation of a special experienced radiologist is necessary. The best results are shown in treatment of low grade gliomas and tumors near eloquent areas.
