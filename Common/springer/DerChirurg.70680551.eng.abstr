 Trauma, operative interventions, infection and other disturbances of homeostasis lead to a uniform reaction of the body, namely release and activation of hormones and cytokines. Profound alterations of substrate flow result, with mobilization of energy stores and degradation of structural and functional proteins of vital organs like the gut mucosa. Due to these reactions the energy demands of the organs are met and energy-consuming synthesis of substrates is indicated. Clinically, hypermetabolism, hyperglycemia, lipolysis and increased urea production with negative nitrogen balance can be observed. The metabolic reactivity is reached by an increased substrate cycling. To avoid negative consequences such as organ dysfunction, a rational situation-adapted substrate supply is warranted as well as reduction of catabolic stimuli and stimulation of anabolic factors. The metabolic care of the surgical patient is still a basic and important task.
