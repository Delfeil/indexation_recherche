Today, enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice, partially due to the belief that intestinal resorption of macromolecules is impossible. However, there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity, and placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy. The documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma, resulting in pain reduction and better mobility. There are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery, traumatology, plastic surgery, and dental surgery. A further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes. In gynaecological treatments, enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries. Breast engorgement is a further indication for enzyme therapy. Further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits.
