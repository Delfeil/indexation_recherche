Health care costs have risen considerably since 1970 in all industrialized countries. This has several causes: changes in demographic structure, the large number of physicians, increased personnel needs resulting from generous vacation and special leave privileges, wage increases and - last but not least - medical progress. Advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for spiralling costs in health care. Careful analyses reveal, however, that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high-technology (CT, MR) imaging. The legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained. Relevant suggestions, such as generally accepted examination strategies, should be realized with the help of the scientific societies.
