  We report on 2 infants with Ullrich-Turner syndrome in whom partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage was diagnosed noninvasively by color-coded Doppler sonography. Several patients with the combination of anomalous drainage of one or more pulmonary veins and Ullrich-Turner syndrome have been described in the literature. However, in the majority of those previously reported cases the diagnosis of partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage was established by angiography during cardiac catheterization performed for confirmation of other cardiovascular malformations. Our patients show that partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage can be diagnosed easily in neonates and young infants, as long as this anomaly is taken into consideration.
