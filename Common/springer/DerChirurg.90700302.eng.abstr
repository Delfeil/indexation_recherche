 A case of malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis is reported in a 77-year-old male patient. There was no history of asbestos exposure. Recurrent right hydrocele with a papillar inguinal mass was the main clinical feature. An inguinal radical orchiectomy with en bloc resection of the surrounding tissue was performed. The therapeutic options for this rare, but aggressive neoplasm are discussed. Because of the disappointing results of antineoplastic chemotherapy or radiation therapy, the importance of initial radical surgical treatment with complete excision is emphasized.
