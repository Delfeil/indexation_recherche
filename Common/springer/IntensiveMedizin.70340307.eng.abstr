 Several studies have shown that HME-filters are not able to prevent the contamination of anesthetic equipment in inhalation anesthesia under experimental conditions. No study could show so far that the frequency of postoperative pneumonia can be decreased with HME-filters. Thus the use of HME-filters in inhalation anesthesia cannot be recommended at present. In addition there are no studies indicating a reduction of frequency of pneumonia during mechanical ventilation by HME-filters in intensive care units. Tubes of mechanical ventilated patients can be changed once a week without the use of HME-filters. This is possible without additional risk for patients to acquire pneumonia. From an economical point of view heat and moisture exchange by cascade is superior to HME-filters. In consequence, for hygienic reasons there is no rational for the use of HME-filters in intensive care units.
