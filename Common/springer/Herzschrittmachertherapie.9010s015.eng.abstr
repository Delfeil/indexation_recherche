  Background: The incidence of atrial arrhythmia (AA) in a DDD paced population is high. Mode switch (MS) functions are today widely used to manage AA during dual chamber sequential pacing. Aim and method: This work aims to present the new MS function of the Chorum (ELA Medical). It is based on the diagnosis of the acceleration of the atrial rhythm to detect premature atrial contractions and on the statistical analysis of the atrial rhythm to diagnose sustained AA. It is fully automatic and independent from programmed parameters including upper rate limit. Results: A clinical evaluation with Holter recordings in 194 patients revealed a high sensitivity; due to the statistical approach of the atrial rhythm AA was appropriately detected even in the case of partial loss of atrial sensing. Additionally, a high specificity could be demonstrated due to the ability of the algorithm to discriminate between pathological atrial rate and normal sinus tachycardia on the basis of the rate acceleration. Still false-positive response of MS occurred, for example, due to oversensing of ventricular far-field signals which can be corrected by reprogramming the device. Specific memory functions allow the clinician to follow up the patient using stored MS episodes. Especially marker chains recorded during MS help to identify false-positive response of MS and to suggest reprogramming of the device.Conclusion: Thus, MS and associated memory function are complementary tools to optimize the functioning of the device and the patient's follow-up.
