Primary intramedullary nailing of femoral fractures is well known to increase the risk of pulmonary complications, especially in multiple-trauma patients with severe thoracic injuries. Aim of this study was to investigate the influence of primary plate ostesynthesis of femur fractures on maior complications after trauma. This retrospective study based on the records of 325 multiple trauma patients (Injury severity score ISS > 18, no letal brain injury, age 16-65). According to the abbreviated injury scale of the Thorax (AIS T) patients were divided in groups without (AIS T < 3, "N") or with relevant thoracic injury (AIS T > = 3, "T"). Both groups were additionally divided in subgroups without severe trauma to the extremities (AIS E< 3, "0") or primary plate-osteosynthesis of femur fractures (< 24 h, "I"). 4 groups were performed: N0 (n = 39, ISS 25  +/-  1, pneumonia 10 %, ARDS 5 %, lethality 10 %); NI (n = 55, ISS 27  +/-  1, pneumonia 4 %, ARDS 5 %, lethality 4 %); T0 (n = 137, ISS 28  +/-  1, pneumonia 21 %, ARDS 15 %, lethality 16 %); TI (n = 94, ISS 31  +/-  1, pneumonia 21 %, ARDS 17 %, lethality 15 %). Primary plate-osteosynthesis of femur fractures did not increase lethality or incidence of pulmonary complications in patients with or without severe thoracic injuries. Also complication rate after primary plate-osteosynthesis was less compared to published results after intramedullary nailing. For this, primary plate-osteosynthesis is recommendable in case of multiple trauma with thoracic injuries.
