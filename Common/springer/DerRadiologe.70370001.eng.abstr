Malignant lymphomas can be subdivided into Hodgkin's disease and low- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The principal therapeutic options are polychemotherapy and radiotherapy. Besides the histological classification, staging of the disease with particular regard to risk factors is an essential prerequisite for the therapeutic decision. Diagnostic imaging modalities such as computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography have improved the accuracy of clinical staging such that invasive pathological staging is only necessary in exceptional cases. A novel therapeutic approach is high-dose chemotherapy with autologous haematopoietic stem-cell support. This treatment improves the survival of patients with relapsed high-grade NHL. The place of high-dose therapy as the primary therapeutic option in malignant lymphoma is now being assessed in prospective studies following encouraging results from single-centre studies, including those involving the treatment of low-grade lymphoma. The effects of antibodies directed against lymphatic cells are currently being examined in experimental treatments. An assessment of the viability and rate of proliferation of lymphoma tissue on completion of therapy using sensitive radiological and nuclear medical methods is an important aim for the future.
