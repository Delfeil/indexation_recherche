  According to the "speed"-hypothesis of cognitive development, the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence. The present study investigates the "speed"-hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using Latent Growth Curve Methodology. Date on 4 measurement points come from the Bonn Longitudinal Study of aging (N=128, mean age 67.2, 53% women). Based on principal factor analysis, markers of mental speed were the WAIS Digit Symbol Test and simple psychomotor task. As indicators of fluid intelligence the WAIS Object Assembly and Block Design were used. After separately fitting Latent Growth Curve Models for the trajectory of mental speed and fluid intelligence, a combined model showed no statistically significant improvement of fit for freeing the covariance between the two slope-factors. Interpreting this result, contrary to the "speed"-hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed.
