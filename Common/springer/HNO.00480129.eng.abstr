Surgical reconstruction of partial defects of the auricle remains an operative challenge. Operative techniques using cartilage frameworks constitute a well established method. According to the localisation and the extend of the defect there are well established procedures. Especially the inferior part of the auricle may cause difficulty due to it's anatomy. In a retrospective study, various reconstruction techniques of partial conchal defects were examined in regard to their aesthetic results. A sytematic operative procedure due to the different techniques was developed. Large defects, extending more than 30% of the concha margin needed a high grade of stability which can be obtained by the use of autologous costal cartilage. According to the localisation of the defect and the available local tissue, the ret-ro-auricular site has to be reconstructed by the use of transposition flaps or split-thickness skin. For the reconstruction of the retroauricular site in the cranial auricular region a combined fascia-fan-flap showed the best results. The inferior auricular region can be reconstructed by the use of an infraauricular transposition flap offering also good opportunities for reconstruction of the lobulus. Second Degree Dysplasias are regarded as conchal defects which can be integrated into surgery.
