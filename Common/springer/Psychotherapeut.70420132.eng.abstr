Body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in-patient and out-patient settings, individually or in groups, alone or combined with other methods. These methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are restricted in their emotions, or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character. Short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays, reference is made to other procedures. The connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter alia and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological consequences are mentioned as active factors. In later development, the body and certain parts of the body acquire a symbolical meaning too, which is important for the therapy. The relationship of body oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy and especially to psychoanalysis shall also be discussed. Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.
