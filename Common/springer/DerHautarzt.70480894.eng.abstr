Seven patients with pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma were treated with inhalation therapy with 36 million IU interleukin-2 for six months. Inhalation therapy was combined with four bolus infusions of DTIC at a dose of 850 mg/m2 once every four weeks. Response rates were 71,4% with 2 patients achieving a complete remission (CR), 2 partial remissions (PR), 1 stable disease (SD), and 2 progressing disease (PD). Therapy was well tolerated with low toxicity. Six of the patients developed cough; one patient was slightly feverish. We conclude that inhalation therapy of lung metastases is a promising addition to the therapeutic arsenal against malignant melanoma.
