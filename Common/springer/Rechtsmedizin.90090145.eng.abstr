A 79-year-old man died of fatal haemorrhage into the soft tissue of the true pelvis 2 days after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy. Autopsy revealed a perforation of the left prostatic lobe with ruptures of the periprostatic vessels. A similar case of transrectal prostatic biopsy-associated complication has not been described previously. The judicial enquiries were discontinued.
