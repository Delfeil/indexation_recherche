Of 46 patients with severe atopic eczema treated with UVA-1, 14 were evaluated as non-responders and 32 as responders. Responding patients significantly had (p<0.05) more severe skin involvement before onset of treatment (clinical severity score SCORAD 62.7 +/- 12.4 points) compared to non-responders (53.0 +/- 10.6 points). Serum levels of total IgE, ECP and sIL2R before treatment did not show any significant differences between the two groups. The data confirm the efficacy of UVA-1 treatment in severe cases of atopic eczema.
