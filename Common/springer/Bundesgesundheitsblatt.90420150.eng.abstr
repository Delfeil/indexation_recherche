In contrast to the regulations in other European countries, blood components for transfusion are defined by the German Drug Law as medicinal products, for which a national marketing authorisation is required. In the case of blood components, i.e. concentrates prepared from individual donations, official batch release testing, as it is in place for plasma products, is not practicable. Thus during the licensing process the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute has to focus on compliance with the state of the art regarding donor selection and testing, as well as on the assessment of quality by means of testing random samples. The current practice of quality control and the available tests and their value are critically reviewed. There is still a need for development of meaningful and feasible test methods, research in this field is a task also of our group. Moreover, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute is permanently involved in discussions in relevant national and European expert groups and official bodies with the aim of further improvements of quality and safety of blood components.
