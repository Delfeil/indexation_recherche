This article examines the risk of false memories induced by psychotherapy with special regard to sexual abuse. Current psychological constructs based on depth psychology are reviewed criticaly. The multitude of psychological disorders connected with sexual abuse in recent time and a subjectivistic misunderstanding of empathy frequently lead sometimes to uncritical acceptance of anamnestic reports about sexual abuse. Thus, the question of what really happened often is risen not before forensic appraisals. It can be shown that the descriptive psychiatric view and depth psychological oriented constructs tend to compete with each other with the consequence of different results in therapeutic practise and forensic appraisal if unappropriately applied. The author shows how to distinct beween induced delusional symptoms and dissociative phenomena. Furthermore he draws attention on the ethically doubtful long-term results of a not correctly indicated use of psychological constructs based on depth psychology about extreme traumatization in the psychotherapy of strongly suggestible patients.
