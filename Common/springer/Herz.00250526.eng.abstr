In the current clinical cardiac electrophysiology well-defined and effective concepts regarding the diagnostic and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias have been intruduced. A further improvement in the cost-benefit and the cost-effectiveness relationships in several fields of cardiac electrophysiology depends on the future technical progress and on the results of ongoing and future scientific studies. On the other side very cost-saving electrophysiological treatments had been developed; the broader clinical use of these treatments is a possibility to optimize the costs for patients' care with cardiac arrhythmias.
