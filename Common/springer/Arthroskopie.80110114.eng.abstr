Influenced by minimally invasive surgery, the endoscopic release of the carpal tunnel has become established in the therapy of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, due to of several intra- and postoperative complications, there is no standard endoscopic procedure. Reviewing 177 endoscopic operations using Agee's single portal technique (operation and follow-up), we present the indication, limits, typical mistakes, and risks of this endoscopic technique. Excellent clinical and electrophysiological results 3 months postoperatively show that both intra- and postoperative problems and second-look operations are only rarely due to the endoscopic system. The most common reasons are too liberal an indication and insufficient training with respect to risks and possible mistakes. From our data, we conclude that Agee's carpal tunnel release system is a safe and convenient endoscopic surgical technique for median nerve decompression with short postoperative recovery and excellent cosmetic and functional results.
