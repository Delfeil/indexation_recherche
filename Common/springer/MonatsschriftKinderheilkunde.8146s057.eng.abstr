Nutrients and trophic factors independent of nutritional substrates influence the proliferation and the differentiation of the cells that make up the intestinal wall. The resorptive mucosa must be differentiated from immunologically active cells of the "gut-associated lymphatic tissue" (GALT). Glutamine is the main oxidative substrate of enterocytes and an important nitrogen donor; its importance becomes apparent in very sick patients. The amino acids arginine and ornithine are mainly important for immunological gut cells as precursors of NO and polyamine synthesis. Complex carbohydrates are fermented in the lower gut portions to short-chain fatty acids, mainly acetic, propionic and butyric acid. The trophic effect of these acids is also mediated via an improvement of blood flow. Among the trophic substances independent of nutrients are the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon and various growth factors, contributing to the maintenance of a eutrophic gut mucosa.
