In total malignant mixed tumors (carcinosarcomas) represent a very rare gynecological neoplasm. In accordance with the embryological genesis primary localizations are with descending probability the uterus, the ovarians and finally the tubes. We report on a 55 year old female patient, with a paraurethral mass, which was primarily diagnosed in 1994. Histopathological evaluation of a transvaginal biopsy did not demonstrate evidence of malignancy at that time. After painful enlargement the paraurethral mass was resected surgically and histopathological evaluation revealed a primary paraurethral malignant mixed tumor (carcinosarcoma). Postoperatively, the patient underwent percutaneous (46,4 Gy) and intracavitarv (2 x 6 Gy) radiation. Twelve months postoperatively there is no evidence of disease.
