 The echocardiographic examination of a female, overweight patient, 71 years of age, with left-sided breast cancer, performed in another hospital, revealed a tumor of the interatrial septum of 3.2x4.0cm. The patient was transferred to our clinic and the finding was identified as a lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum by echocardiography, computertomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. It was confirmed by biopsy and histological examination.
