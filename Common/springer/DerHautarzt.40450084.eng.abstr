Abstract.  Suramin has long been used in the treatment of onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis. Recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines. Ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma. Five patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma resistant to classic hormonal therapy were treated with high-dose suramin. Four of the five developed a papulovesicular or maculopapular rash within 2 - 4 weeks of starting therapy. The rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within 10 days. In tumour therapy, high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of 200 - 300 µg/ml. Therefore, a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes.
