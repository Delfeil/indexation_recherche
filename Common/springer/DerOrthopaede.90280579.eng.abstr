The decision about operative or non-operative treatment of herniated lumbar discs has to be based on the results of clinical and neurological examination. Results of imaging techniques as CT or MRI are secondary. Various percutaneous endoscopic or open techniques have been described. The most appropriate technique is determined by the anatomical situation of the dislocated lumbar disc tissue. Intradiscal percutaneous therapies such as percutaneous nucleotomy and laser decompression are possible, but they revealed poor results in prospective randomized and controlled studies. Chemonucleolysis remains as an effective intradiscal technique at the time, but is afflicted with side effects and complications. Endoscopic transforaminal or interlaminary techniques are still experimental. Whenever open surgery is necessary, microsurgical techniques are preferred. If a certain technique is to be applied, there has to be the correct indication, technical support for and experience in using the choosen method.
