115 andrological patients were studied with psychological self-assessment tests to assess both their motivation concerning parenthood, and their own explanations for the causes. Additionally self-esteem was evaluated in 51 patients. The main results were: Motivation concerning parenthood is of greater importance in coping with involuntary childlessness than objective andrological data. Patients assess their situation quite realistically; no tendency to misinterpret the medical data in order to defend negative feelings and to protect self-esteem could be found. Most patients with reduced fertility consider this situation a challenge and are willing to mobilize resources and the help of others in order to cope. Self-esteem was only threatened in those patients with longlasting unvoluntary childlessness and little acceptance of medical infertility treatment and parenting substitutes, e.g. adopting a child.
