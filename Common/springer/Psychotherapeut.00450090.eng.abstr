The author gives a short overview of the psychodynamic and psychoanalytic basics of psychotherapy with guided affective imagery. The differences of the imaginations of neurotic patients and patients with severe personality disorders are demonstrated and discussed. Two clinical cases are described in detail which show the special elements of symbol formation on different levels of ego-structure. Then the most important results of the recent infant research and the research of attachment behaviour, especially those of the group of Fonagy, and their importance for the theory of symbol formation are discussed. The theory of potential space is used as a base for understanding imaginative processes. General and special technical recommandations for the treatment of borderline cases with guided affective imagery are derived. Especially the relationship to the theories of Bion, Ogden and Winnicott is estimated.
