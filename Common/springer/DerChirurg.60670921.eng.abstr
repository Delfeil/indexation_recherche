 With a response rate of 60.6 % to a questionnaire sent out in 1994 it is possible to give an overview of the situation in hernia surgery at the 142 surgical clinics of Switzerland. In general, regional anesthesia is the preferred method (67.4 %). Together, Shouldice repair and fascia transversalis repair cover over 90 % of the repair techniques in primary hernias. In recurrent hernias the same techniques dominate (70.2 %) a large spectrum of different operation methods; implantation of foreign materials is rare (5.9 %). Only 4.5 % of all Swiss surgical clinics have some experience with endoscopic hernia surgery.
