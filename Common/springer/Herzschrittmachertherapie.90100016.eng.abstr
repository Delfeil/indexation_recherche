 Decreases in cardiac function accompanying heart failure are at least partially due to aberrations in electrical activation that result in reduced coordination among chambers and myocytes within any single chamber. This discoordinate activity decreases overall efficiency resulting in reduced output or, if output is maintained, increased myocardial oxygen consumption. Pacing has been shown to improve function by either 1) improving coordination between atrium and ventricle, thus increasing transport of blood into the ventricle and maximizing preload, as well as 2) reducing mitral or tricuspid regurgitation or by 3) improving coordination between ventricles to minimize paradoxical septal motion or, finally, by 4) improving mechanical coordination of myocytes within a ventricle. Incoordinate myocyte activation in the left ventricle is observed as depressed global contractile function, since only a fraction of myocytes contract simultaneously and as decreased myocardial compliance since myocytes do not relax simultaneously. Recoordinating myocytes by cardiac pacing can dramatically alter global measures of contractility and diastolic function within just a few paced beats presumably without increasing oxygen consumption.
