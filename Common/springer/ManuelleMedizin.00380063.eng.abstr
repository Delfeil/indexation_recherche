The prominence and number of female athletes has grown dramatically during this century. This increased participation in physical activity has led to significant health benefits and improved physical fitness. Regular weight-bearing exercise has a beneficial effect on the bone mineral density (BMD). But strenuous training can affect the female reproductive system and become a major problem concerning female athlete's health. Furthermore, female runners driven to excel in her sport and pressured to have a thin physique may attempt to lose bodyweight or body fat and can develop patterns of eating disorder. These patterns may lead to menstrual dysfunction and subsequent osteoporosis. Many female athletes are at risk of developing one or more of a group of three medical disorders, described by the American College of Sports Medicine in 1992 as the Female Athlete Triad. The Female Athlete Triad can be prevented. Medical management requires an early diagnosis for the improvement of the treatment efficiency.
