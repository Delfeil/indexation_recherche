 More and more older people interested in continuing education recognise the many possibilties for information, communication and co-operation which Internet offers to them. Institutes of continuing education and other institutions serving older people are required to provide training for this target group in order to make access to the world of the digital media easier, to support them in acquiring media competence and to design interesting virtual educational programmes and courses. In this article, the possibilities of showing people over 50 the way to the new communication technologies will be described in view of the experiences gained during the information campaign "Senior-Info-Mobil". It will also be demonstrated based on the examples of the European network "Learning in Later Life" and other projects such as "Learning through Research" that virtual working groups and networks of elders can become a driving force of a new "learning culture", involving also those who do not live near universities or who for health and other personal reasons cannot participate in educational programmes offered in the area.
