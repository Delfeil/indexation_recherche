The article reviews the history of orthognathic surgery from the middle of the last century up to the present. Initially, mandibular osteotomies were only performed in cases of severe malformations. But during the last century a precise and standardized procedure for correction of the mandible was established. Multiple modifications allowed control of small fragments, functionally stable osteosynthesis, and finally a precise positioning of the condyle. In 1955 Obwegeser and Trauner introduced the sagittal split osteotomy by an intraoral approach. It was the final breakthrough for orthognathic surgery as a standard treatment for corrections of the mandible. Surgery of the maxilla dates back to the nineteenth century. B. von Langenbeck from Berlin is said to have performed the first Le Fort I osteotomy in 1859. After minor changes, Wassmund corrected a posttraumatic malocclusion by a Le Fort I osteotomy in 1927. But it was Axhausen who risked the total mobilization of the maxilla in 1934. By additional modifications and further refinements, Obwegeser paved the way for this approach to become a standard procedure in maxillofacial surgery. Tessier mobilized the whole midface by a Le Fort III osteotomy and showed new perspectives in the correction of severe malformations of the facial bones, creating the basis of modern craniofacial surgery. While the last 150 years were distinguished by the creation and standardization of surgical methods, the present focus lies on precise treatment planning and the consideration of functional aspects of the whole stomatognathic system. To date, 3D visualization by CT scans, stereolithographic models, and computer-aided treatment planning and simulation allow surgery of complex cases and accurate predictions of soft tissue changes.
