 The opportunity to treat a patient with a single-lead-VDD stimulation demands a new approach to the routine pacemaker therapy. It was the aim of the study to take a look at the specific problems and complications that occur during the use of the single-lead-VDD stimulation in all appropriate cases without special preoperative diagnostic steps. Beside that we studied the influence of the recently established single-lead-VDD stimulation on the other modes of stimulation in all patients who were in need for a pacemaker.  We analysed the number of all implantations done by us from 1991 until 1996, in 1991 and 1992 without, from 1994 to 1996 with VDD stimulation. We looked for the problems of VDD stimulation in a follow-up period of at least 9 months.  During the studied period the percentage of patients with AV-block remained nearly the same. From 1994 to 1996 we did 206 VDD implantations, this are 25.5% of all first time implantations. The percentage of AAI- and DDD-pacemakers remained more or less the same, whereas VVI implantations decreased from 72.2% in 1991 and 1992 to 43.3% from 1994 to 1996. In 17 cases the minimal intraoperative atrial potentials were less than 0.5mV, but only 2 of these patients showed a loss of atrial sensing later. All together we could prove intermittend atrial sensing loss in 11 (5.3%) patients out of 206, 6 (2.9%) of them were clinically symptomatic but without the necessity of an operative correction. A second operation had to be performed in 6 cases, in 4 of them caused by the special electrode or mode (ventricular loss of capture in 3 cases and severe sick sinus syndrome in 1 case). 12 patients showed atrial fibrillation in the follow-up. 3 patients were only programmed to VVI mode, but in 9 of them the atrial fibrillation could be terminated by drugs.  The single-lead-VDD therapy proved to be very practicable and effective inspite of its specific problems and compromises. Because of its physiological way of stimulation for more patients this therapy produces a remarkable improvement in the possibilities of the pacemaker therapy.
