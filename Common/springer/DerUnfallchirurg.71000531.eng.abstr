We report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement. As a result of implanted cement/spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component, the iliac vessels were compressed. Furthermore, we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65-year-old patient during a revision operation. We recommend that in case of acute ischemic syndromes of lower limbs following total hip replacement, an angiography should be performed in order to exclude an extravascular cause of thrombosis. For therapy in those cases extra-anatomic bypasses should be preferred to thrombectomies.
