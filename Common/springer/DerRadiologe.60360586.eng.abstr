Two cases of arterioportal fistulas and new possibilities in diagnosis and treatment are reported: A 62-year-old women was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain. Color flow duplex sonography showed an arterioportal fistula between the proper hepatic artery and the ectatic portal vein that was confirmed by angiography, permitting percutaneous embolization as a definitive treatment. The pain disappeared immediately. A 36-year-old man underwent surgery due to a penetrating gastric ulcer. He was referred to us with an abdominal murmur. Color flow duplex sonography proved by spiral CT with 3 D reconstruction and maximum intensity projection (angio-CT) revealed an arteriovenous fistula between the gastroduodenal artery and a mesenteric branch. Angiography confirmed the diagnosis and permitted definitive therapeutic embolization.
