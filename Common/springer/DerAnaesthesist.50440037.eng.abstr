 The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation model (APACHE II, APACHE III) is used to describe the severity of illness and predict the outcome in critically ill patients. APACHE III, introduced in 1991, has not yet been validated in Europe. We calculated APACHE II and APACHE III scores in patients after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and compared the prognostic value on hospital mortality. Method. One hundred fifty patients with stay of over 24 h were enrolled in the study and prospectively and consecutively investigated. APACHE II and III scores were calculated as described by the authors. The mean and median values of the survivors were compared with the non-surviving group (Mann-Whitney U test). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC analysis) and the areas under the ROC curves were plotted. Results. Of the 150 patients, 34 died during their hospital stay (22.7%). The mean and median APACHE II and III scores were significantly higher (P<0.001) in the non-surviving group. The area under the ROC curve was higher for APACHE III (0.899) compared to APACHE II (0.847). Conclusions. APACHE II and APACHE III were both found to have good prognostic value in general ICU patients. Our results suggest that the APACHE III version includes a more precise prediction of hospital mortality than APACHE II. A new aspect of APACHE III is an expanded modification of the Glasgow Coma Scale to assess neurologic derangements.
