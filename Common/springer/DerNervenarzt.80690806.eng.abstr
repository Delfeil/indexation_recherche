After the exploration of the psychiatric patient by a medical student in the context of a small psychiatric teaching-group (Psychiatric Clinic, University of Münster) was finished, both medical students and patients (n=94 each) were asked about their experiences during that interview by means of a special questionnaire: Most patients reported about positive effects of the educational interview. 60% of the patients spoke about a positive prove of regained strength, 35% gained new or deeper insights. On the other hand 10% of the patients made worrying and unpleasant experiences. Students diminished their anxiety to hurt patients by asking too intimate questions. 30 to 40% of the students reported about difficulties in structuring a clinical interview, especially with patients who refused to talk or didn't answer the students' questions correctly. 60% of the students made also emotional learning experiences.
