The potential of distraction osteogenesis in mandibular reconstruction has been limited by its questionable efficacy in previously irradiated bone. The possible osteogenetic effect of recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on lengthening of irradiated mandibles was investigated in beagle dogs. We studied nine adult dogs which underwent a full course of external beam radiation therapy (60 Gy/30 fractions). Six months after completion of radiotherapy, the molars were extracted bilaterally followed by bone lengthening of the mandible using an intraoral device. On postoperative day 3 and 7 we injected 10 µg bFGF into the osteotomy site of each right hemimandible. The left sides were used as controls. The time course in ossification of the distracted area was evaluated at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after completion of bone lengthening. The radiographs of the newly formed bone tissue were measured by digital image analysis. Corresponding to the radiographic findings, the histological examination of the removed jaws showed an earlier and more intensive bone formation in the treated side after 2, 4, and 6 weeks compared to the control side. We conclude that bFGF promotes the ossification of distracted mandibles after radiation therapy in dogs.
