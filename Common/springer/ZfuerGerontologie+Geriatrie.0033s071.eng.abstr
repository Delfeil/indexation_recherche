 Medical theories and practices concerning illness and health in old age as well as several aspects of society that do influence the aging process are described from a historical perspective integrating classical antiquity, middle ages, and modern times. From the present state of research it is distinguished between "primary illnesses in old age" and chronical diseases which might principally also begin in younger ages but take a different course in old age. Even if the frequency of disease and multimorbidity is increasing, negative stereotypes of the aging process have to be invalidated. Advances in medical sciences are a good pre-condition for increasing physical and mental health in old age.
