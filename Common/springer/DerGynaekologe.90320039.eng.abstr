An urgent task of modern obstetrics is to reduce the number of very early prematures. Long-term impairment of these infants is still too frequent. Ascending genital infections, particularly before 32 gestational weeks, are the most important cause of prematurity. The best chance of preventing very early prematurity is to employ a prophylactic screening program, preferably including self pH measurement of all pregnant patients and paying additional attention to all other important risk factors. The results of such a "Prenatal Care Self-Examination" program are encouraging. The rate of very small prematures, with a birth weight of less than 1,500 g, in all 1,120 multigravidae who have so far taken part in this program, is clearly lower (1.3 %) than in immediate previous pregnancies when it was 7.8 %. The rate of extremely small infants of less than 1,000 g amounted to 0.9 % compared to 3.9 % in immediate previous pregnancies. Results from a prospective study just recently presented convincingly confirm what can be achieved in an entire city. In Erfurt, with 208,000 inhabitants and about 1,500 deliveries per year, all in the one maternity department in this city, 16 practitioners taking care of the pregnant patients, i. e., nearly one-half of them in Erfurt, motivated their patients to take part in our prematurity prevention program with its "Prenatal Care Self-Examination," where the patients themselves measured their vaginal pH twice a week. The results are very interesting. In the group of 1,842 patients without prenatal self-examination activity, the frequency of very early prematures, i. e., less than 32 gestational weeks, was 3.3 % (n = 61). In the group of 314 patients who performed prenatal self-examinations, the frequency was only 0.3 % (n = 1). This is an eleven-fold and significantly lower rate.
