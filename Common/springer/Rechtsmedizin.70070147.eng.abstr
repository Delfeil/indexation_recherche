 Tortoise shell guinea pigs (n = 6) were administered ofloxacin (1 mg/mL) in their drinking water for 3 weeks. Black, reddish-brown and white hair was collected separately from each animal before and after treatment. The hair samples were analyzed by HPLC. All hair fibers showed positive results for the drug substance administered. Even low drug intake resulted in distinct differences of the drug content in hair fibers of different color, whereas in cases of high drug intake an increasing influence of hair pigmentation on the analytical results was observed. The highest drug content was always found in black hair samples, non-pigmented hair showed the lowest drug concentrations and the drug content in reddish-brown fibers was less than in black hair samples from the same animal. From the results it was concluded, that eumelanins rather than pheomelanins are the decisive factor for ofloxacin-melanin binding in hair and the amount of drug intake is thought to determine the relevance of hair pigmentation on the analytical results.
