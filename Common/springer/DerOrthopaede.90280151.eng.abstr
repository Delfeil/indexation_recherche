The management of neuromuscular foot deformities in children and adolescents must be individualized because of differences in etiology and pathomechanics. If conservative treatment fails or reaches a plateau early soft tissue procedures are recommended. Treatment should focus not only at correction of the deformity but also at reestablishment of muscular balance. Early postoperative mobilisation is usually possible provided adequate orthotic control is maintained. Regular clinical follow-ups help to minimize postoperative problems. The general aim should be an optimization of functions and only rarely to achieve a normal foot. The basic principles of management can be described as correction of deformity, stabilization of unstable joints and balance of muscle power.
