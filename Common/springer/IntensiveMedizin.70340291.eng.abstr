 A 68-year-old patient with dyspnea since 5 days from pulmonary embolism documented by perfusion scintigraphy underwent examination with ultrasound before thrombolytic therapy. US showed a transit-thrombus in the right atrium. Because of threat to life a thrombolytic therapy was given with 9 million IE of streptokinase over 6 h (UHSK) and additional therapy with heparin. After three courses of UHSK the transit-thrombus and the thrombosis of the leg had nearly completely resolved. This mode of therapy is an interesting alternative in treatment for pulmonary embolism and transit-thrombus of the right heart.
