The normally used combination of conflict oriented inpatient treatment with so-called non verbal therapies (e.g. relaxation therapy, role playing and exercises to increase body awareness among others) for patients with psychogenetically formed symptoms or psychosomatic diseases is frequently not sufficient. Not only in behavioral therapy but also in psychoanalytically oriented treatment an explicit formulation of therapy goals is demanded. Therefore the conflict and problem solving oriented approach integrates additionally a behavioral oriented component of problem solving on the way to reach the formulated treatment goal. This makes it possible to intervene at the psychodynamic or more concretely at the problem solving level, both in the psychoanalytic frame of reference and possible problematic processes during inpatient therapy can be immediately recognized and addressed to. Common features and differences between this approach and other treatment settings are discussed.
