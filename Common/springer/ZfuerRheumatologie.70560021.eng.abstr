 The effect of meloxicam, a new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, on spontaneous osteoarthrosis of the ankle joint in Crl:CDBR rats was investigated. The drug was administered in the feed at doses of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mg/kg/day over a period of 2 years to 50 males and 50 females per dose. 100 male rats and 100 female rats were used as controls.
