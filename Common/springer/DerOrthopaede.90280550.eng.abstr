Charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage 4 of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) which is known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease since 1886. This entity, which can be subdivided into 3 groups including subgroups, predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly. The first symptom, often unnoticed by the patient for a long period, is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer-toe formation and mobile pes cavus. Progredient atrophy of the peroneal, extensor, tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus excavatus with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot, secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment. Permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive microtrauma (stage 5 of HMSN).
