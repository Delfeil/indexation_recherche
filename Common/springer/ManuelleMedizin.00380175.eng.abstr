The examination included 192 girls and boys with clinical symptoms of first-degree lateral curvature of the spine situated primarily in the lumbar part of the spine and with asymmetric position of posterior superior iliac spines. The main group was composed of the 118 patients with positive acceleration phenomenon confirmed by the Piedellou sign. The remaining 74 children constituted the control group where a functional cause of pelvis asymmetry was not unequivocally detected.
