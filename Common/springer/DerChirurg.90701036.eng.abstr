 An easy venous access improves the quality of life of patients who need prolonged intravenous therapy. In the case of vena cava superior syndrome the classic access in the jugular or subclavian vein can be difficult or even impossible. We report on seven implantations of Port-a-Cath in the inferior vena cava for patients presenting contra-indications to classic venous access to the vena cava superior (five cases of vena cava superior compression syndrome, one tracheostomy and one extended tumor of thoracic wall). We describe the operative technique and we analyze the indications, the results and the complications of this rarely used technique.
