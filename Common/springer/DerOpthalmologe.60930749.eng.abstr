Inflammatory stimuli induce the expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells. The adhesive forces between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium are antagonized by the shear stress of the flowing blood. The aim of this study was to examine how differences in the apparent wall shear rate measured in iris venules with varying caliber affect leukocyte-endothelium interaction.
