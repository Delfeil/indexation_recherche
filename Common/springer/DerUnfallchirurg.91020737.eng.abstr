A tendon transfer or interposition tendon graft is usually recommended for treatment of late diagnosed ruptures of the tibial anterior tendon. A new operative technique using augmented tenoplasty is described in one patient. After 3 years the patient was asymptomatic and showed normalized function. The operative method has the advantage of no additional loss of function in comparison with other methods.
