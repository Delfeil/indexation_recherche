We report on a 44-year-old man with the rare case of a mucin-positive carcinoma of the urachus. We performed extended partial cystectomy with regional staging lymphadenectomy of the obturator lymph nodes. Histological investigation revealed a mucin-positive carcinoma of the urachus with negative lymph nodes. For this case, we present symptoms, a plan for diagnosis, and treatment of these tumors.
