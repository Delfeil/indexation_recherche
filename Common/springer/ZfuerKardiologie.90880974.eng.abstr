 Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death is hampered by the inability to accurately identify high risk patients. Various noninvasive methods such as determination of left ventricular function or heart rate variability as well as invasive electrophysiologic testing are currently used for risk stratification. Noninvasive measurement of microvolt T wave alternans (TWA) is a promising new method to assess repolarization abnormalities; in experimental studies, TWA was associated with an increased incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Since the occurrence of TWA is heart rate-dependent, it is measured either during atrial pacing or during exercise stress testing. The first clinical validation of the method was performed in patients undergoing invasive EP testing to assess prediction of inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. A first prospective validation of the noninvasive method was performed in patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest fitted with an ICD. Further studies have shown a good concordance between invasive and noninvasive TWA determination. The occurrence of TWA in this population was of predictive value with respect to arrhythmia recurrence. Recently published data confirm the value of TWA assessment with respect to identification of patients with congestive heart failure at high risk of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The use of this method in post myocardial infarction risk stratification is currently under prospective evaluation.
