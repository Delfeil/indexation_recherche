 The high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment. In a 13-year period, 52 out of 95 patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively. The was being left in situ on an average of 6.6 days. After an observation period of at least 36 months a recurrence was seen in 2 of these 52 patients (3.9 %; causes: volvulus after 6 months/fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day). Amongst the 43 'non-splinted' patients, recurrence of adhesive obstruction was documented in 8 cases (18.6 %; causes: adhesions after 0.3-136.9 months). In the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted. Complications concerning the nasointestinal tubes did not occur. The rate of perioperative complications was similar in both groups.
