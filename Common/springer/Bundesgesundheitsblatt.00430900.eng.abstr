Germany's new Protection against infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz) will take effect on January 1, 2001. It will result in an increase of notifications on reportable infections.  Counties and states have to adjust the infrastructure of their reportable disease notification systems to meet the demands of the new legislation. An increased demand for human resources at the non-medical staff level is anticipated. Continuing education programs for medical and non-medical staff at public health offices are mandatory.  Physicians in private practice, hospitals and diagnostic laboratories and leaders of nursing homes are target groups for special information.  A timely review and epidemiological evaluation of all notifications forwarded by county health offices has to be performed at the state level.This is a prerogative for immediate response in case of non-localized increases in reported disease incidence. The author advocates the development of an epidemiological rapid reaction scheme (epidemiological fire brigade) in which public health physicians at the county, state, and federal level cooperate in a gradual response to outbreak situations according to actual demand.
