Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, estecming, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapie. This form of treatment is scientifically validated (Grawe 1997). Its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory. It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps. This second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks. At last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed, and available outcome data is summarized.
