Nd-YAG posterior capsulotomy in treatment of secondary cataract has the main disadvantage of increasing the risk for pseudophakic retinal detachment by destroying the posterior lens capsule. This is of great interest in high myopic eyes with an increased risk for pseudophakic retinal detachment. In 219 cases of secondary cataract in our clinic a surgical posterior capsule polishing has been performed and this group was followed up over 6 years looking for intra- and postoperative complications.
