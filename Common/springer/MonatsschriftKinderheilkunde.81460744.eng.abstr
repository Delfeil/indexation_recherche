This paper summarizes the results of an attempt to reconstruct the fates of Jewish pediatricians from Germany, Vienna and the German Pediatric Hospitals in Prague between 1933 and 1945. The relevant archives in Europe, USA, Great Britain and Israel provided facts and relevant dates for 697 Jewish pediatricians who were humiliated and murdered or who emigrated. Compared with the total number of 1361 pediatric specialists in the three areas, more than 50% of them were Jews as defined by the Nazi racial laws. So far, 577 cases have been cleared up: 446 of them emigrated to 31 countries; 63 became victims of the Holocaust; other individual destinies included going underground or committing suicide. The fate of about 120 persons is still unknown. This paper discusses the probable reasons for the high percentage of Jews in pediatrics, the anti-semitic attitude of the German Society for Pediatrics and the continual humiliation and persecution of Jewish pediatricians in the Nazi period.
