We report on a 28-year-old patient, who acquired a left diaphragmatic hernia after suffering a motorcycle accident seven years ago. The diaphragmatic hernia was not diagnosed at that time. After a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed for acute cholcystitis, there was herniation and secondary incarceration of a bowel segment into the preexistent diaphragmatic hernia. We describe laparoscopic surgical repositioning of the bowel segment and closure of the diaphragmatic defect.
