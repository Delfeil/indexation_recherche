Radiography is still the basic imaging method in traumatology and orthopedics. However, technical improvements and new imaging modalities may partially replace the conventional diagnostic imaging strategies. This review describes actual indications of x-ray examination, computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). New developments and future aspects in digital radiology, CT and MRI, two- and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques and image guided therapies are demonstrated.
