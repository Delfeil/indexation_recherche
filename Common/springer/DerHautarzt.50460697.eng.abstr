Pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems. High dosed corticosteroids are the treatment of choice. However, recalcitrant pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives. Pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine A. Because of side effects and drug interactions, the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored. Six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum, unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies, were treated with oral cyclosporine A at mean daily doses of approximately 3 mg/kg. Marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3-6 months. Only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment. No severe irreversible side effects occurred. The results show that low-dose cyclosporine A treatment can be considered a first-line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum.
