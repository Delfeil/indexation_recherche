After cruciate ligament reconstruction using an autogenous central bone-patellar tendon-bone graft persistent complaints are described in the literature. There is the difficulty to distinguish the morbidity associated with the graft harvest and the morbidity caused by the injury and the reconstruction procedure. In order to clarify the morbidity resulting from the graft harvest alone, we evaluated those patients who had transplantat harvest from the opposite knee. Between 1990 and 1995 a central bone-tendon-bone graft has been taken from the contralateral uninjured knee in 37 patients, in 22 cases for anterior and in 15 cases for posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. 27 patients were clinically (IKDC Score), isokinetically and radiologically followed up in an average of 25,3 months after the operation (range: 9-73 months). 21 patients were classified into IKDC group A. Except of one patient with an extension deficit of 5  ° all others showed normal range of motion. Only 5 of 27 patients expressed minimal knee pain during vigorous activities. Three of them reported about weather sensitivity in addition. These 6 patients were ranked in group B. No patient was classified into IKDC group C or D. The isokinetic examination showed a normal level of quadriceps strength. At final followup, the technique of Blackburne and Peel was used to assess patellar height. There was no radiographic evidence of patella contracture or baja. According to our results taking the autogenous CBTB graft used for cruciate ligament reconstruction leads to no serious morbidity.
