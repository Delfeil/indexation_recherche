In arthroscopy of the ankle a number of sports-specific alterations can be found in soccer players. These comprise exostoses of the anterior tibia, a corresponding lesion of the talar neck and anterior soft tissue impingement. Those lesions can be summarized in one symptom complex. In the Traumatology Department at the Nuremberg-South Clinic 27 patients were treated for this symptom complex from January 1992 to December 1996. Twenty-five patients were followed up for an average of 21/2 years. The functional results were assessed using a score published by Pförringer and Stolz in 1991. Our 25 patients achieved an average of 42 of 50 possible points, whereas  5 patients remained below 35 points. The average time interval between arthroscopy and reliefe of symptoms was 7 months among the  25 patients examined and was therefore relatively long. The range of movement in the tibiotalar joint clearly improved. Seventeen patients regained their previous sports activity level again. In the presence of concomitant ligamentous instabilities, additional stabilizing treatment is necessary, which should be performed in one session. In the case of impingement exostosis and soft tissue impingement, we suggest that this symptom complex be characterized with the German term `Fußballergelenk' (soccer player's ankle).
