Background. Microperforations of the trabecular meshwork can be made using an endoscope guided Er:YAG laser. As shown in enucleated human melanoma eyes, these microperforations are not accompanied by thermal damage of the surrounding tissue. We now report our first clinical results using a commercially available endoscope/laser system for performing this particular kind of goniotomy.
