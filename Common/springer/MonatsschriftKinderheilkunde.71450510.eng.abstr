Background: Chronic cough and thoracic pain, commonly caused by upper airway infections, are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics. These "benign" symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders. Methods: In two patients (male, age 41/12 and 43/12 years) chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm (Pleuropulmonary blastoma). Results: Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis. An incomplete resection was performed in both cases. Both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy. One boy died, the other one is alive and well more than 6 years after diagnosis without evidence of disease. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy) can provide a long term remission.
