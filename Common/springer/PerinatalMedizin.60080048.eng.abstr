 We investigated the function of the cochlea by means of registering the transient otoacoustic emissions in 53 jaundiced neonates with bilirubin levels up to 344 µmol/l. The transient otoacoustic emissions resulting from active outer hair-cell movement were registered by means of the otodynamic analyzer ILO 88/92. Hair-cell function diagrams were produced to quantify the data. The data of neonates with a mean bilirubin level of 258.6 µmol/l (median 203-344) were not significantly different from those of non-jaundiced neonates. An average increase in bilirubin level of 63.8 µmol in 15 neonates did not affect the function of the cochlea. Continuous checking showed in a further 8 neonates that there is no influence on the function of cochlea whether the bilirubin level increases or decreases. The results demonstrate that bilirubin levels of up to 344 µmol/l in a frequency spectrum of 1-5 kHz do not impair the function of the cochlea.
