Carcinoma of the breast is the most frequent malignancy in woman. Moreover, the incidence of the disease is rising in the younger age groups. Recent advances in the primary surgical treatment of breast cancer have demonstrated that it is possible to bring about a long-term improvement in the patient's quality of life without compromising the prognosis. Depending on the breast volume and the size of the primary tumor, the surgeon can now offer the breast cancer patient a number of options. These include the entire range of breast-conserving techniques (both volume reduction and volumetric replacement) and the use of implants or autogenous tissue for breast reconstruction following - or simultaneous with - mastectomy. In cases where breast-conserving surgery is feasible, partial or modified radical mastectomy can be followed by autogenous tissue reconstruction with TRAM or latissimus dorsi flaps. Because of their safety and versatility, latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flaps are currently making a remarkable comeback.
