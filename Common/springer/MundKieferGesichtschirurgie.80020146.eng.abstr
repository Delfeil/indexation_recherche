Children with craniofacial malformations are at special risk for the development of peripheral airway obstruction. The problems are magnified in patients with retroposition or hypoplasia of the mandible. In these cases, the base of the tongue is posteriorly displaced, hereby decreasing the airway diameter. By application of distraction osteogenesis the mandible can be lengthened to move the base of the tongue forward and open the airway. Three female patients aged between 7, 11, and 15 months suffering from peripheral airway obstruction caused by mandibular hypoplasia were treated by gradual distraction. All of them had a gastrostomy or a nasogastral tube in place, respectively, due to severe nutrition problems. In the youngest patient tracheostomy was performed shortly after birth and was already planned in the 15-month-old child, who had received a permanent nasopharyngeal tube. The 11-month-old child suffered from severe refractory sleep apnea. Exercises in oral feeding were possible in the youngest patient after 10 days of distraction. In the oldest one, the airway tube was removed on the six day of distraction and, thus, tracheotomy was successfully avoided. In the 11-month-old child apneic events a rapidly decreased. Our experience suggests that distraction osteogenesis after careful preoperative evaluation can be successfully performed for the treatment of peripheral airway obstruction in patients with selected craniofacial anomalies.
