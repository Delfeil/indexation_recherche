Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare disease presenting with persistent red to yellow-brown papules or plaques which are mainly localized symmetrically on the extensor aspects of the hands and fingers, the elbows and the knees. The histology shows a leucocytoclastic vasculitis in early lesions and fibrosis of the dermis later on. Dapsone is the treatment of choice. Today, EED is usually assigned to the neutrophilic dermatoses in which an association with hematological disturbances is well documented. We report on a patient with EED and glioma WHO grade IV, a coincidence unreported hitherto. Additionally, we review the literature on diseases associated with EED.
