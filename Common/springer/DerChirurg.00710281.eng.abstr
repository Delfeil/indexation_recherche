Abstract.  Surgical hospitals can be seen as operational or even industrial production systems. Doctors have a major impact on both medical performance and costs. For active participation in the management process, knowledge of industrial controlling mechanisms is required. German hospitals currently receive no procedure-related financial revenues, such as prices or tariffs for defined medical treatment activities. Maximum clinical revenues are, furthermore, limited by principles of planned economy and can be increased only slightly by greater medical performance. Costs are the only target that can be autonomously influenced by the management. Operative controlling in hospitals aims at horizontal and vertical coordination of subunits and decentralisation of process regulations. Hospital medical performance is not clearly defined, its quantitative measurement very problematic. Process-orientated clinical activities are not taken into account. A high percentage of hospital costs are fixed and can be influenced only by major structural interventions in the long term. Variable costs are primarily dependent on the quantity of clinical activities, but also heavily influenced by patient structure (comorbidity and risk profile). The various forms of industrial cost calculations, such as internal budgeting, internal markets or flexible plan-cost balancing, cannot be directly applied in hospital management. Based on these analyses, current operational concepts and strategic trends are listed to describe cost-management options in hospitals with focus on the German health reforms.
