A retrospective study of 86 motorcycle accidents that occurred in the year 1992 is reported. Examination of the case histories supplemented by telephone conversations yielded the following results: 90.7% of our patients were male and their average age was 28.8 years; the age group between 25 and 30 years was the most frequently involved (27.9%). Most motorcycle accidents happened during weekend trips out in the summertime. Special injury patterns were found for injuries of the upper and the lower extremity. Lower extremity injuries (46%), and especially open tibia fractures (19.7%), were among the most common injuries sustained by motorcyclists in crashes. Injuries of the upper extremity most frequently took the form of fracture of the distal radius (18.8%). The average stay in our hospital was 35.4 days. In 23.4% of cases the patients had to change their job after the accident. More than half the crashes happened with motorcycles with between 500 and 750 cc stroke volume. Over a third (34.5%) of the patients had held their driving licences for more than 8 years. A plea is made for more preventive measures, such as better driving instruction, better road conditions and legislative changes, against motorcycle crashes. From the aspects of cost and the rate of complications it is reasonable to strive for a surgical treatment as soon as possible after the crash.
