A lot of different endogenous and exogenous factors are accused to promote squamous cell carcinomas in the upper aerodigestive tract. Main risk factors are the chronic tobacco- and alkohol consumption. The fact, that many patients develop syn- or metachronic carcinomas in this area was first described by Slaughter et al. 1953 and explained with the phenomenon of field cancerisation. Concerning to this hypothesis the whole mucosa of the upper aerodigestive-tract is premalignant damaged. In our study the micronucleus-frequency was determined as a biomarker for the genetic injury to prove the fieldcancerisation on the cellular level at 159 people (control-group, abuser, patients with HNSCC). Our results confirm the hypothesis of fieldcancerisation of the mucosa of the upper aerodigestiv-tract at strong tobacco- and alkohol consumers and patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore there is a highly statistically significant correlation between increasing micronucleus frequency and increasing tobacco abuse. As a final result of our study the micronucleus assay seems to be of good value to show a genotoxic damage in healthy mucosa at people with a high risk to develop HNSCC, but it's not usable to give any answer if and when such carcinomas arise.
