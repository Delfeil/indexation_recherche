Extraskeletal osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck are extremely rare. This case report describes a 55-year-old patient who has suffered from four squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the mouth since 1985. Thirteen years after successful radical resection of the SCC of the planum buccale left and radiotherapy, the patient developed a radiation-induced extraskeletal submandibular sarcoma on the left [7, 8, 9, 12]. The primary sarcoma developed in the planum buccale, the area which had been repeatedly exposed to radiotherapy, and spread into the soft tissue.
