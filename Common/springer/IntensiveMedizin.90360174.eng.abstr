 The occurrence of intermittent nocturnal bradycardia as well as bradyarrhythmias should lead to diagnosis of confounding sleep related breathing disorders (SRBD). From a therapeutic and prognostic point of view, a diagnosis with complete history, noninvasive and, if necessary, invasively cardiological investigations as well as cardiorespiratory polysomnography is essential. Apart from the exclusion or confirmation of a SRBD as the cause for nocturnal bradyarrhythmias, polysomnography enables the diagnosis of bradyarrhythmias which only occur during REM sleep. Bradyarrhythmias can usually be removed by effective therapy of the SRBD by nasal ventilation. It is still being discussed if patients with apnea-associated bradyarrhythmias require the implantation of a permanent pacemaker.
