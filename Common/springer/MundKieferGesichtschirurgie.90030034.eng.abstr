The use of free buccal mucosal grafts in the treatment of urethral strictures has become very popular. In 1996 and 1997 we harvested free buccal mucosal grafts up to 7 cm long and 4 cm wide from  12 patients who underwent urologic surgery for urethral strictures. In  2 patients the donor site was closed primarily by sutures. Four patients received Lyodura and another  4 patients received Syspurderm as temporary wound coverage. In  2 patients Ethisorp patches were used. Donor site pain was judged by the patients on a visual analogue scale during the first postoperative week. The 2 patients who received the Ethisorp patches complained of more intense pain, probably caused by the rigidity of the material. In all patients regeneration of the donor site mucosa was good. During the follow-up period of 4-18 months scar formation at the lower vestibulum was noticed as the only complication. Permanent limitation of mouth opening, stenosis of the parotid duct or hypesthesia did not occur.
