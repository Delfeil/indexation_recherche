A 52 year old female had a large destructive basal cell carcinoma of the back measuring 27 cm in diameter. There was destruction of the vertebral bodies, envelopment of the medullary cone, early spinal compression and soft tissue spread into the retroperitoneum. Early neurological defects were present. The tumor was excised, covered with two large rotation flaps and post operatively irradiated. The patients quality of life has improved, the tumor has not progressed and there is no sign of paraplegia.
