 The medical history of a 28-year-old non-insulin-dependent and non-diabetic patient with a hypoglycaemic episode before death is reported. At autopsy, an (surreptious) insulin administration was documented by lethally high serum insulin in central and peripheral blood during hypoglycaemia, According to the anamnesis, the judical inquiry and the autopsy findings, a suicidal intent, murder by insulin or Munchhausen-syndrome could be excluded. We therefore diagnosed a hypoglycaemia factitia caused by the diet.
