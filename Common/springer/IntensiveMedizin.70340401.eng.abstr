 The interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach. As in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device (ASDOS) is affected by late complications, particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations. The demonstration of 4 case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an ASDOS device. The diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation. For early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after ASDOS implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about postinventional problems of this device is essential. Every ASDOS patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography. The emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately. Furthermore, the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications.
