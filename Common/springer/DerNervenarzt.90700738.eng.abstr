Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a 63 year old female in Austria. Sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia, disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment. Being a farmer, the patient belongs to a recognized high-risk-group, as most other infected people do. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a human infection by Streptococcus suis in Austria so far. The results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis, and thus, are in contrast to the guinea-pig-model by Kay, who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss. The present knowledge of Streptococcus suis meningitis with respect to neurophysiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and increasing resistance against antibiotics is discussed.
