If continuous seizure activity lasts longer than 5 minutes generalized tonic-clonic seizures require prompt treatment, if significant morbidity and mortality are to be avoided. The mortality varies (mean: 20%) depending on patient age and etiology. Control of status epilepticus is achieved by benzodiazepines in about 80% of cases: Lorazepam is recommended due to its longer-acting effects on the central nervous system. To maintain the anticonvulsive effect phenytoin is usually administered intravenously. Fosphenytoin (not approved in Germany) has advantages over phenytoin, because it can be given three times more rapidly and produces fewer side effects. The IV use of valproic acid in status epilepticus seems to be promising, but needs further evaluation. There is no generally accepted treatment protocol for the therapy of persistent seizure activity lasting more than 60 minutes (i. e., refractory status epilepticus). Usually phenobarbital, or general anesthesia with thiopental or pentobarbital are treatment recommendations. In recent reports, the administration of midazolam or propofol proved to be effective and well-tolerated.
