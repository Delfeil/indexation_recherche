In the literature about borderline patients, self-destructive dependency needs are described, as well as oral-aggressive root conflicts. Using case studies, the author points out that in persons with borderline personality organisation, self-destructive forms of delinquency are as likely to manifest themselves as aggressive forms are. The first form is connected with sexual abuse, the second with physical abuse. Therefore, delinquency should be differentiated according to the traumatic experiences. Finally, depending on the direction of delinquency - either directed against oneself or against others - various therapy requirements are outlined: delinquency in the sense of self-mutilation primarily requires the team to perform a holding function, while aggressive delinquency primarily demands a firm setting. The author concludes that the outcome of therapy for borderline personality disorders depends on the assessment of the direction of the delinquency.
