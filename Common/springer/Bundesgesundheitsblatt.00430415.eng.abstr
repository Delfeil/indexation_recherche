The data of the National Health Interview and Examination Survey provides information about the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the population living in Germany. The survey consists of a health oriented questionnaire and an examination of 7124 persons from a representative sample of the 18 to 79 year-old population. Even using strict criteria for each risk factor in order to avoid overestimating the number of subjects at risk, the results show an alarmingly high dissemination of risk factors among the population. Thus one third of the 18 to 79 year-old men and women got cholesterol levels >= 250 mg/100 ml. Obesity, i. e. a body mass index >= 30 kg/m2 is prevalent in one of five persons. More than half of the overweight, over 50-year-old women, show an abdominal fat distribution, which is an additional factor to the risks in question. 18% of the men and women show a "moderate" to "severe" hypertension (as defined by the WHO criterias). More than 20% of the 20 to 49 year-old men are heavy smokers with a daily consumption of >= 20 cigarettes a day. Only one third of all 18 to 79 years old do not have any of the risk factors, as there are daily smoking, hypercholesterolemia, obesity and hypertension (the last terms defined as mentioned above). About 40% show one factor, ca. 20% two factors. There is a strong dependence between the distribution of the risk factors and the socio-economic level. For women, an increase of the total risk has been shown over the last years.
