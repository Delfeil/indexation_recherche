 The gold standard in the operative treatment of chronic insufficiency of the lateral ligaments of the ankle joint is replacement with a tendon (tenodesis). The disadvantage of this method is limitation of movement. The results of the replacement of ligaments with a periosteal flap are similiar to the results after tenodesis, but the rate of complications is significant lower. We investigated the histological changes in periosteal flaps in patients. We saw an alignment of the collagenous fibers in the periosteal flap 8-12 weeks after the operation. The results are statistically significant. The conclusion is that the periosteal flap in the replacement of ligaments changes into a ligamentlike structure.
