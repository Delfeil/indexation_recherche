Introduction. Computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in Europe. Reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern CT scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes. The lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low-dose CT owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma.
