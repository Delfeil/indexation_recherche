 In over 80 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the Nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long-term results. Dysphagia, inability to belch or vomit as well as the gas bloat syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication. The frequency of these symptoms could be reduced by modification of the original Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication into the so-called "floppy" Nissen fundoplication, a short and loose wrap of mobilized gastric fundus. Failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon. Here, reoperation with refashioning of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication. Technical alternatives may selectively be chosen, when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated hiatal hernia, esophageal shortening, or serious esophageal motility disorders. Such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy, barium swallow, 24-h pH monitoring, and manometry. Alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs, including the Nissen fundoplication, Collis gastroplasty, and the Belsey Mark IV. Modifications of the 360  ° Nissen operation are partial fundoplications like the Hill repair and the Toupet dorsal fundoplication. Because of a high failure rate in the long-term follow-up, application of the ligamentum teres cardiopexy and of the Angelchik prosthesis is not recommended.
