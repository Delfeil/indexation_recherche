The positive results of several multi-center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years. It was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease. To improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice, a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the German-speaking European countries. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge, compare the results of recent clinical trials with the experience from other  therapeutic options and assess their clinical evidence.
