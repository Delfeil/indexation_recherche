Delivering women gently and safely by avoiding perinatal asphyxia, preterm delivery and ascending intrauterine infection may help to protect babies from cerebral damage during and after birth. The self-determination of women should not be restricted by unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. In contrast, obstetricians should cooperate with women to assure an appropriate balance between personal freedom of the mother and safety for the baby during delivery.
