 During the years 1993-1995 several studies have been published on topics of clinical toxicology. Those of clinical interest are being discussed: in general poisoning therapy there is an outspoken tendency to use activated charcoal therapy and avoid gastric lavage and emesis. Extracorporal treatments like continuous arteriovenous hemoperfusion (CAVHP) are effective with poisoning of phenobarbital and theophylline. As a proven indication for poisoning with cyanide hydroxycobalamin is meant to be an effective antidote. The benefit of a N-acetylcysteine antidote therapy can be optimized by a prolonged duration of treatment. By prolonging the start dosage to 60 minutes side-effects are reduced. The serum level taken after 4 h of paracetamol ingestion must be interpreted carefully. When seriously poisoned by digitalis antidote and pacemaker therapy are indicated. A poisoning with zolpidem is similar to benzodiacepines and tricyclic antidepressive drug overdosage goes together with the highest mortality. Poisoning with ibuprofen can endanger life.
