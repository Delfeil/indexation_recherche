The "Marjolin's ulcer" is a malignant lesion which is developed especially at chronic wounds after burn trauma. The latency from primary trauma to the malignant transformation is about 30 years. The lesion is more aggressive than other squamous cell carcinomas. We report on the combined radiation and surgical therapy of an 65-year-old patient with this lesion on the right hand and regional lymph node metastases. The extensive tissue defect after wide excision was reconstructed with a reversal radial forearm flap.
