To investigate the correlation between the mechanism of an accident and the resulting injury pattern we reviewed the data of 195 prospectively documented multiply traumatized patients. Information on the accident was based on descriptions given by eye witnesses, police and the emergency medical staff. Only moderate to severe lesions (AIS >=3; Abbreviated Injury Scale Version 1990) of each body region were analyzed. The mean injury severity (ISS) for all these patients was 39.5 (18 - 75); the lethality was 34%. Different types of accidents led to various injury patterns. We found a high incidence of lesions of the head in frontal (F) motor vehicle crashes (MVC) nonbelted (76%), of the chest in lateral (L) MVCs (80%), of the abdomen in F MVCs belted and in L MVCs (60%), of the pelvis after suicidal fall (SF; 69%) and of the lower extremities in motorcycle accidents (90%), SFs (69%) and collisions with a train (67%). Severe lesions of the spine were frequently seen after accidental falls (41%), SFs (30%) and F MVCs belted (25%). There was a very substantial difference in the injury pattern after suicidal jump (26% head, 69% pelvis, 65% lower extremity lesions) and accidental fall (54% head, 19% pelvis, 23% lower extremity lesions). As a result of the correlation with specific injury patterns, the preceding mechanism of accident should be exactly documented and considered by the physician during the early phase of resuscitation.
