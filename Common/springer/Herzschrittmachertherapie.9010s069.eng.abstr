 Modern pacemaker therapy is considered to be a safe and reliable procedure in the treatment of symptomatic and/or prognostically important bradycardiac arrhythmias. About every sixth patient dies of sudden cardiac death in the period after pacemaker implantation, whereby death is in the vast majority of cases ascribable to progression of underlying cardiac disease. But in the recent past, it has become clear that permanent electrostimulation of the heart may involve the risk of elicitation and/or aggravation of live-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Especially in advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-related R-on-T phenomena, "short-long" sequences and sensing failure, for example during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia may elicit secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.  In light of the fact that this cause of sudden cardiac death is avoidable in such pacemaker-related events, a better understanding of the pathomechanisms involved and appropriate awareness would be the best precondition of making modem pacemaker therapy not only reliable but especially safer for the patient.
