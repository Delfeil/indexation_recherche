A comprehensive but individualized, psychotherapeutic approach to new schizophrenic psychoses was developed in the Turku Clinic of Psychiatry. The suitability of the model for public health care systems has been studied in connection with multicentre studies. Applications of the model are carried out in numerous units in Finland and also in other Nordic countries. The establishment of initial joint meetings (therapy meetings) attended by the therapeutic team, the patient and his/her family members proved to be important both therapeutically and in the assessment of case-specific therapeutic needs. The experiences and follow-up results of the model are described. The indications and principles of psychoanalytically oriented individual therapy with schizophrenic patients are specifically examined.
