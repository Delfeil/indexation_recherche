The strength and fracture resistance of bone is determined by the structure of the trabecular network and the cortical shell. While standard 2D techniques like histomorphometry are inadequate to assess the 3D nature of the trabecular network, isotropic 3D datasets of this network can be acquired with the new imaging modality of µCT. However, so far the quantitative analysis of the generated datasets, in particular the extraction of appropriate parameters describing the bone structure, has not been finally solved. In this article we describe the technology and applications of µCT systems relevant in the field of osteology. The most important technical features of current µCT systems in this context are: 1. A spatial resolution down to 5-10 µm can be achieved. 2. The maximum sample size is related to the desired resolution by a factor of approximately 1000, that is, a resolution of 10 µm limits the maximum sample size to approximately 1 cm. 3. Scan times for µCT systems vary between minutes and hours.
