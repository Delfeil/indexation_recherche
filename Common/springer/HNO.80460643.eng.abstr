It is the task of each medical specialty to develop guidelines for diagnosis and therapies. Examinations done by several specialties should follow a common consensus. A randomized survey at 70 German ENT departments investigated the current position of tracheobronchoscopy and esophagoscopy at each institution. Sixty questionnaires were evaluable. Altogether 8,295 tracheobronchoscopies and 10,404 esophagoscopies were performed. Thirty-six percent of all tracheobronchoscopies and 6% of all esophagoscopies were done with a flexible system. Approximately 58% of all tracheobronchoscopies and 55% of all esophagoscopies were performed for tumor staging. Complications during tracheobronchoscopy occurred in 0.8% of cases and in 0.58% of the esophagoscopies. Using these data an interdisciplinary quality assurance concept was developed for tracheobronchoscopy and esophagoscopy. Current experience has shown that a otolaryngologists in Germany mainly perform rigid tracheobronchoscopy and esophagoscopy. Although endoscopy is mostly done in cases with varied anatomic structures, complications are very rare and comparable to flexible techniques. Greater experience with flexible systems also is to be encouraged in ENT departments.
