Natural and artificial UV radiation are environmental factors with both beneficial and harmful biological effects. This article will explain the physical measurement quantities and their relation to the biologically effective dose and will summarize the present technical state of the art of personal UV monitoring. In practical use are dosimeters based on polysulphone, a polymer which undergoes changes in its optical properties upon irradiation with UV. Other systems determine the UV dose by quantifying damage induced in Bacillus subtilis spores upon UV exposure. An electronic UV sensor represents a new and interesting development. Personal UV dosimeters will become an useful tool in both clinical and scientific areas within dermatology.
