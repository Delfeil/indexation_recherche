We report on 1952 arthroscopies of the knee in children aged up to 13 years and on 6464 arthroscopies in adolescents aged 14 to 17. At the  same time operative arthroscopy was performed in 64% of the children and in 73% of the adolescents. The preoperative diagnosis was shown to be incorrect in 25% of the children and 24% of adolescents. Hemarthrosis was found in 35% of the children and in 29% of the adolescents. The most frequent pathology was in the patella (30% of the children and 41% of the adolescents). In the upper recessus, the distribution was 29% and 24% respectively, and 21% and 24% respectively, at the medial capsule and 16% and 14% at the medial femur condyle. A lesion of the ACL was obvious in 15% of the children and in 26% of the adolescents. A lesion of the medial meniscus was documented in 8% of the children and in 15% of the adolescents and in the lateral meniscus in 10% and 11% respectively. The most frequent operation was carried out on the synovia in 26% of the children and in 22% of the adolescents and on the plica in 23% and 24% respectively. A lateral release was performed in 19% of the children and in 18% of the adolescents, followed by operations on the joint space in 16% and 13%, respectively, on the patella in 16% and 19% respectively and on the medial condyle in 16% and 8% respectively. Operations on the medial meniscus were performed in 10% of the children in 18% of the adolescents, on the lateral meniscus in 10% and 12%  respectively, and on the cruciate  ligaments in 4% and 10% respectively. Diagnostic problems occurred in 1.4% of the children and in 1.2% of the adolescents and operative  problems in 1.8% and 1.4% respectively. The intraoperative complication rate was found to be 2% in children and adolescents. Only rarely does diagnostic and operative arthroscopy in children and adolescents  have problems and complications. Therefore, we conclude that either diagnostic or operative arthroscopy can be recommended under the following circumstances: In hemarthrosis, if ligament or meniscal lesions are suspected, after acute or recurrent patella dislocation, in knee joint effusion or pain for an unknown reason, for lavage of septic knee joints and if clinical examination or NMR is not possible because of pain or fear.
