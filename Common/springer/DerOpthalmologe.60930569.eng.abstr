Background: Erbium laser sclerostomy (ELS) ab externo is a minimally invasive addition to conventional fistulating glaucoma surgery. To date, the success rate of this method is lower than that of trabeculectomy or goniotrepanation. The chief cause of therapy failure is postoperative episcleral scarring of the bleb. It was the aim of the present study to decrease the occlusion rate of this complication.
