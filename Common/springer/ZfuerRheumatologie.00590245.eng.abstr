 In 1998 the German Federal Ministry of Education and Science launched a competition for major comprehensive grants with the ultimate goal of forming networks to link patient care, education and research. There were over 150 applications; 9 of which were successful. Among the winners was our proposal to create a federal medical network in rheumatology ("Kompetenznetz Rheuma") and we are pleased to announce its official start here with the presentation of the abstracts from our first network symposium in Berlin. Our endeavor is aimed at bringing together doctors in clinical practice, patients and scientists to improve patient care in rheumatology. Therefore, this network is made up of various components, namely documentation, patient care and new diagnostic efforts. Particular care is being devoted to take scientific work from the bench to the bedside. The rheumatology medical network is organized and further developed by six regional centers of competence located in Berlin, Düsseldorf, Erlangen, Freiburg, Hannover and Lübeck/Bad Bramstedt. Of course, the network is designed as an open system. We invite everyone, who is interested to participate in our work. Detailed information on our projects and our goals can be gained from the persons involved and on our website .
