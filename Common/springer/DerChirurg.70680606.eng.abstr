 Chest trauma cases benefit to a great degree from adequate, timely initiated and consistent prehospital treatment. However, prehospital determination and evaluation of blunt chest trauma is associated with a high degree of uncertainety. The purpose of our study was to examine and determine, in a collective of 255 trauma patients, the value of additional prehospital pulse oximetric monitoring regarding the optimization of the emergency physician's diagnosis and treatment of blunt chest trauma. We conclude from our findings that, in addition to the physical examination, with the application of pulse oximetry the prehospital diagnosis of lung contusion as well as the early detection of tension pneumothorax are more accurate. Therefore, the combination of physical examination and pulse oximetric monitoring is a requirement for the optimization of prehospital diagnosis and therapy in blunt chest trauma.
