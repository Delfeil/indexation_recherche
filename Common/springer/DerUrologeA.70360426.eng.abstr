Indications, results and complications of 144 women who have undergone implantation of the current model AMS 800 since 1983 and remained in continuous follow-up in our department are presented. Included are 70 patients suffering from stress urinary incontinence (SUI) type III after 208 previously unsuccessful incontinence procedures, 54 patients with incontinence due to neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD) and 20 patients with congenital or acquired internal sphincter weakness of other causes. In the NBD group, apart from sphincter implantation a total of 113 additional operations were necessary due to complex malfunctions of the urinary tract: augmentation ileocystoplasty in 51 patients, ureterocystoneostomy in 23 patients and 43 operations at the bladder neck. One hundred and twenty-six patients (86 %) achieved total continence and 5 patients (3 %) were significantly improved. In 9 females (6 %) incontinence persisted, and 4 patients ultimately underwent urinary diversion into a Kock pouch. With the implanted artificial sphincter 116 patients (81 %) are able to empty their bladder spontaneously, without residual urine and without the necessity of intermittent self catheterisation. Under the aforementioned conditions implantation of the artificial urinary sphincter AMS 800 is the most effective therapy for complex female incontinence.
