 Different conceptions to revise the licensing regulations for physicians (Approbationsordnung für Ärzte) aim to interlock preclinical and clinical subjects. Therefore a more practice-oriented anatomy has to be taught in basic and postgraduate medical education. At the Westfalian Wilhelms University of Münster we established an interdisciplinary anatomical education, executed by clinical lecturers in cooperation with the educational staff of the Department of Anatomy. The integral element is the comprehensive constitution of clinical anatomy: clinical practitioners of different specialties together with anatomists give lessons in applied anatomy accompanying the dissection course. Clinically experienced lecturers of anatomy guide senior medical students in practical courses, refreshing their anatomical knowledge using particular prosections. These courses correlate with the topics of the distinct clinical tutorials. Conjointly clinical practitioners and anatomists plan, and perform meetings in postgraduate medical education.
