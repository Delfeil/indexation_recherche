Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an hereditary connective tissue disorder caused by defective collagen synthesis, the main features being hyperelasticity and vulnerability of the skin, recurrent bleeding from fragile blood vessels, and secondary deformities of the joints. Ocular involvement is a rare occurrence, e. g., corneal and scleral rupture from minor blunt injury, lens displacement, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. To date, few reports exist concerning the treatment of retinal detachment in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, all of them dealing exclusively with conventional scleral buckling surgery.
