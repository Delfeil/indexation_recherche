Operations on skeletal metastases of the extremities represent the most frequent surgical treatment in orthopedic oncology. From 1970 to 1997, 340 patients were operated on in 383 surgical procedures in the Orthopedic Department of the University of Heidelberg. Carcinoma of the breast and renal cell carcinoma were the most common primary tumors. Operations concerned mainly the femur with acetabulum (55 %) and the humerus with glenoid (25 %). A pathologic fracture occurred in 51 %. While in these cases surgical treatment is absolutely necessary, it is contraindicated in preterminal patients. In imminent fractures or peripheral compression syndromes, the indication is relative and has to be justified on a multidisciplinary basis. Marginal resection of the tumor is allowed because of the limited life expectancy of most patients. Only in patients with solitary metastases and a better prognosis the resection of metastasis margin can be more extensive. Intensification of local therapy by adjuvant irradiation is indicated in an R2 situation, depending on the patient's prognosis. An analysis of our cases from 1994 to 1996 exemplifies the increasing use of modular tumor endoprostheses (52 %). In meta-diaphyseal and diaphyseal cases, cement-augmented osteosynthesis is mainly used (34 %). The application of these established reconstruction techniques after metastasis resection in cases with adjuvant radiotherapy assures a pain-free extremity capable of weight bearing.
