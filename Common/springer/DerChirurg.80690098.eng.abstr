 Angiomyolipomas are hamartomas that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis (M. Bourneville-Pringle). Clinically, this long-term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass. Due to the high percentage of fat components in this tumor type, computed tomography is far superior to other radiological procedures. In view of two of our own case reports, the therapeutic strategies are discussed, paying regard to the actual literature in this field.
