  To prevent secondary cerebral hypoxia and ischemia in comatose patients, monitoring of cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygenation is of great importance. Monitoring of the jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) has been shown to continuously evaluate cerebral oxygenation and, thus, enabling the estimation of cerebral blood flow. A SjvO2 below 50% indicates a critically reduced cerebral oxygenation.
