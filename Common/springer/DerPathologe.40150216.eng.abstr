Heterotopic Ossification (HO) occurs as a consequence of several diseases and of various forms of trauma. HO is particularly frequent in paraplegic patients with spinal cord lesions. It is obvious that extraskeletal cells are able to differentiate into an osteogenic direction. However, the mechanisms of the induction process of HO and the stimulating agents are not precisely known. A novel tool for studying the ossification process at the level of transcription is the technique of non-radioactive in situ hybridisation. Using digoxigenin labeled cDNA probes we investigated the distribution patterns of types I, II and III collagen mRNAs and the mRNA of Transforming Growth Factor beta 1 (TGF- 1) in heterotopic ossification of pressure sores of paraplegic patients. The three collagen mRNAs as well as the TGF- 1 mRNA exhibited substantially divergent distribution patterns. Type I (1) collagen mRNA was predominantly detectable in preosteoblasts, chondroblasts and chondrocytes of the ossification zone. Type II (1) collagen mRNA was nearly exclusively found in cells of the chondrogenic lineage. Type III (1) collagen mRNA was detectable at low levels in soft tissue, but was strongly expressed by chondroblasts and chondrocytes of heterotopic cartilage. In contrast expression of TGF- 1 mRNA was found in a spatial different distribution pattern in areas of proliferation of mesenchymal tissue and in different stages of ectopic bone formation. As in the case of collagen Typ I (1) and III (1) mRNAs the maximum of localization of TGF- 1 was dedected in chondroblastic areas of heterotopic ossification. Taken together our in situ hybridization experiments provide evidence that chondrogenic cells play a central role in the process of HO with a phenotypic alteration in collagen type expression and a strong expression of TGF- 1 mRNA. These findings support individual in vivo function for TGF- 1 in local cellular regulation of ectopic bone formation.
