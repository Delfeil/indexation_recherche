 We report a case of a 26-year-old patient, a tilelayer by profession, with a history of a fall from a height of 5 meters with blunt thoracic injury and resultant left atrial rupture. The emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 3 points) with no recordable blood pressure. After two hours of resuscitation at the site of accident and at the closest emergency traumatology unit a marginal blood pressure was seen. With a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the nearest cardiothoracic surgical unit. During transfer, the patient had a cardiac standstill with asystole and was further reanimated and resuscitated. On arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro-femoral cannulation was supported by a heart-lung-machine circulation. Through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated. The heart was effectively emptied and with deep hypothermia with a reduction of oxygen consumption by all organs especially the brain was taken care of. The patient could be discharged from hospital on the 18th postoperative day in absolute good health.
