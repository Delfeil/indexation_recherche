Considering its frequency and fatality rate dengue fever repesents the most important tropical virus infection. Several millions of  infected people including thousands of German tourists are recorded annually. Due to the increase of insect populations and intercontinental travelling the four dengue serotypes nowadays can be found worldwide. Sequential dengue fever infections have been reported to occur with increasing severity. Secondary infections, which are also  found in tourists, may be associated with  hemorrhagic fever and may be life- threatening, especially in children. During primary infection, a laboratory diagnosis can be  made by detecting both IgM- and IgG-antibodies. The serotype involved can be identified by PCR. Dengue fever-like symptoms can also be caused by a variety of parasitic or  virus infections. Although a specific therapy is not available, intravenous infusions may be of vital importance during dengue hemorrhagic fever.
