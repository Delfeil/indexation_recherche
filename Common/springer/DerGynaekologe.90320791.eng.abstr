The laboratory findings of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets are signs of an acute pregnancy complication often associated with abdominal pain and intrauterine growth retardation. A high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed. The high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade. However, the fact that HELLP syndrome can also occur for up to 1 week post-partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question, in particular, since there is a high rate of hemostasiological complications after cesarean section in acute HELLP syndrome. Because of the correlation of complications of HELLP syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia, the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features. The results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in HELLP syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept.
