Aim of the present study was a comparison of four quality of life (QoL) questionnaires in 228 patients with psoriasis (PSO, n=148) and atopic dermatitis (AD, n=80) regardings feasibility, discriminant validity and sensitivity to change. Evaluating were performed before and after treatment in clinic. The following questionaires were compared. 1) Freiburg Quality of Life Assessment for Dermatoses (FLQA-d), 2) Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), 3) Chronic Skin Disease Questionnaire (CSDQ) and 4) questionnaire on everyday life (ALLTAG). All questionnaires were able to discriminate significant reductions of QoL in PSO and AD, as compared to controls. In parallel to the clinical improvement, all questionnaires showed QoL improvements as well, i.e. the questionnaires were sensitive to change. However, not all of the DLQI and ALLTAG scales were sensitive to change. Also, in some cases part of the scales of these questionnaires could not be calculated due to missing data. Otherwise, all questionnaires were valid and easy to handle. Thus, QoL of patients with PSO and AD can reliably be assessed by various questionnaires. Decisive for selection are the aim and the design of the study.
