Abstract.  Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare manifestation of hereditary or acquired thrombophilia. We saw a case of Budd-Chiari syndrome in a 30-year-old woman leading to initial diagnostic difficulties. She underwent surgical side-to-side shunt and 9 weeks later an almost normal liver could be demonstrated on computerized tomography. Budd-Chiari syndrome should be considered if the Chiari triad with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and ascites occurs in a patient. If necessary, invasive diagnostic procedures (e.g. angiography) must be performed. Therapeutic options are anticoagulative therapy and porto-systemic shunt, either as a TIPS or a surgical shunt. If severe liver failure occurs or liver cirrhosis is present, orthotopic liver transplantation is an additional option which also cures hereditary thrombophilia.
