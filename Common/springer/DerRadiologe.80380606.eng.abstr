Purpose: Venous congestion of the superior or inferior caval system has to be considered as a medical emergency. The results of various recanalization procedures and their utility are analyzed. Patients and methods: 176 patients with superior and 28 with inferior caval obstruction were treated with Gianturco-Z (n=39) and Wall Stents (n=207) respectively. Balloon venoplasty was performed prior to stent implanation. In 27 cases, local thrombolysis with urokinase was employed. Results: Interventional procedures were succesful in 198 and without success in 6 patients. In most patients, symptoms were relieved during or early after recanalization. No major complications were found. Discussion: Balloon angioplasty with stent placement and local thrombolysis are successful in the treatment of superior and inferior caval obstruction. Self-expanding Wallstents are superior to Gianturco-Z-stents. Oncologists should be made familiar with this type of treatment.
