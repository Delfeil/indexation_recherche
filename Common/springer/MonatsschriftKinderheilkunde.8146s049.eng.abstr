About a century ago paediatricians observed that in the faeces of breast-fed infants, Bifidobacterium bifidum was the predominant microorganism compared to those of bottle-fed infants. It was shown thereafter that aminosugar containing oligosaccharides it contains are growth factors for a specific strain of Bifidobacterium. Meanwhile, more than 130 lactose-derived oligosaccharides have been identified in human milk. Some of these components, such as lacto-N-tetraose and lacto-N-fucopentaose I and II, do not occur in minute amounts but in concentrations up to 1-2 g/l. As the total amount of complex oligosaccharides is between 5 and 8 g/l these components must be considered major human-milk constituents. There is striking evidence that human-milk oligosaccharides are potent inhibitors of bacterial adhesion to epithelial surfaces, an initial stage of infective processes. Therefore, these oligosaccharides are considered to be soluble receptor analogues of epithelial cell surfaces participating in the non-immunological defense system of infants fed with human milk. In addition, they may also influence inflammatory processes by acting as ligands for certain cell-adhesion molecules.
