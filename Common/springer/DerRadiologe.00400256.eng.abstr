Due to the development new of imaging devices which produce a large number of tomographic slices, advanced techniques for the evaluation of the large amount of data are required. Computer supported extraction of dynamic 3D-models of the patients anatomy from temporal series thus is highly desirable. Since the diagnostician should be able to quickly make sensible decisions based on the models, high accuracy is required within a minimum of time.
