Background and Objective: Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a rare pregnancy-associated autoimmune bullous disease characterized by autoantibodies to the 180 kD bullous pemphigoid antigen (BP180). The clinical spectrum of PG is polymorphic and for diagnostic purposes, a skin biopsy is usually taken demonstrating the deposition of autoantibodies.
