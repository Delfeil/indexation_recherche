The impingement syndrome is a common disorder of the shoulder girdle. The causes for this syndrome may be anatomic changes in the coracoacromial arch, also within the ultrastructural regions, on the one hand, or changes in the biomechanics which have developed for various reasons, on the other. Diagnosis is based on roentgenograms using the appropriate technique. In large-scalestudies, sonography has proved to be an extremely sensitive screening method for differential diagnosis of rupture of the rotator cuff.
