 Experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in man. Ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable. Because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory, such as microelectrode recording of transmembrane action potentials and high-density optical and electrical activation mapping, animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies. Studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias. Animal models have enabled the mechanisms of fibrillation and defibrillation to be understood and new therapeutic concepts to be developed. The purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed. Because of the clinical importance of coronary artery disease this article concentrates on those arrhythmias caused by myocardial ischaemia and infarction.
