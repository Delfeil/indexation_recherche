The indications or ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary disorders are described. Clinical applications are several lung diseases in adults and especially in children. In specific, well-defined applications, the feasibilties of ultrasound are promising. Sonography provides important additional information to chest X-ray and is even superior to CT under special circumstances. Pulmonary sonography is a useful link between conventional X-ray and more expensive cross-sectional imaging. In the evaluation of pulmonary diseases at present the potential of ultrasound is not optimally used.
