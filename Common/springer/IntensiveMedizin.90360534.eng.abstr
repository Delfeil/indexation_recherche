 We report on a 29 year old female patient with recurrent syncope, QT-prolongation as well as documented torsade de pointes tachycardia, who was diagnosed as having a long QT-syndrome. Since the patient was treated with the macrolide antibiotic Clarithromycin shortly before the first syncope and it is known that Erythromycin, a drug of the same group, can lead to QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes tachycardia, the differential diagnosis between the acquired and the congenital form of the long QT-syndrome needed to be established. No prior ECGs existed. Because of persisting QT-prolongation more than six months after discontinuation of Clarithromycin therapy and QT-prolongation of the QT-interval in the patients's uncle's ECG, we diagnosed a congenital form of the long QT-syndrome. The patient is treated with a beta blocker and has been asymptomatic since then. From the case report, we discuss the features of the long QT-syndrome, its differential diagnoses, and treatment options.
