Transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus Botalli (PDA) has become a routine procedure. Only PDA in low birth weight infants, and short and wide open PDA in small children could not be closed by means of catheter technology. Different transcatheter closure systems are available now. We report on a premature infant now 16 month old weighting 6,8 kg were surgery seemed inadvisable. After angiography a funnel- shaped PDA seemed to be suitable for closure by a Ductocclud spiral coil (PFM company). The spiral coil could not be set in place safely because meanwhile the pulmonary PDA month had widened after angiography. Transcatheter closure then was successful using a 17 mm Rashkind double umbrella (Bard company) in modified implantation technique with a 8 french introduction set, and special attention to avoid the isthmus of the aorta and pulmonary artery stenosis.
