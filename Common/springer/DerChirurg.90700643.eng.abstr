 The implantation of preternatural orifices is a procedure frequently performed by the visceral surgeon in spite of the advances of modern surgery concerning preservation of continence. In order to avoid unnecessary complications, certain strict principles of operating technique must be followed. The cumulative rate of complications is found to be at least 50 %.

A well-implanted and adequately cared for stoma will have a positive influence on a patient's quality of life.
