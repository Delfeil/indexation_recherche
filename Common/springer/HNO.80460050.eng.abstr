The postoperative pain and stress experienced by tonsillectomy patients are often underestiminated. For this reason traditional methods of analgesia are frequently used but with an ineffective result. Our study involved an analysis of pain sensation with regard to postoperative analgesia after adult tonsillectomies. In all, 150 patients following tonsillectomy were treated with different methods of analgesia, which included Diclofenac monotherapy and combined treatment with Tramadol-retard and Naproxen. Postoperative sensations of pain were realized in a visual analogous painscore, with consideration given to individual experiences of subjective pain. In addition, circulatory and hemopoiesis parameters were controlled. Results showed that the postoperative analgesic effect of Diclofenac was significantly less than that of Tramadol-retard and Naproxen. Diclofenac monotherapy after tonsillectomy was only sufficient in cases involving an individual's low pain sensation. In cases with moderate or stronger pain the tonsillectomy patient requires an effective postoperative analgesia, as achieved with combined therapy using Tramadol retard and Naproxen. Aggravating side effects were not found in both schemes of analgesia.
