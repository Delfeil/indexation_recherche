The prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many industrialised and developing countries and growing to a world-wide medical and socio-economic problem. In a recent report of the WHO the world-wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority. Inadequate long-term results of weight reduction in children and adolescents and the increasing socio-economic burden to the health systems, as well as the high grade of persistence of obesity aggravate the problem and demand primary prevention efforts.Future directions of primary prevention measures could be the time of onset of obesity, the "early adiposity rebound", intrauterine malnutrition, weight gain during infancy, low energy expenditure in infants, familial adiposity, composition of food and modification of fat intake.
