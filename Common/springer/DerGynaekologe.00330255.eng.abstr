For therapeutic and diagnostic applications permanent catheters may be used. The localisation of the catheter depends on the function and the mode of use. Epidurale and intraspinale catheters may be used for pain therapy, whereas i.v.- or i.p.-catheters are suittable for the application of medication and for diagnostic procedures. In gynecological oncology for recurrent i.v.-applications the implantation of port systems or hickman catheters are of benefit for the patient. Experienced gynecological oncologists may use the technique described by Seldinger for catheter implantation in local anesthesia. Therewith individualized out- and in-patient care with i.v.-nutrition and pain medications is facilitated.
