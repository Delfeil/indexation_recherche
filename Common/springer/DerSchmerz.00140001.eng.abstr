Background: About 10% of all schoolchil- dren are suffering from migraine and 50% from tension-type headache. Headache of acute onset usually will be treated with analgesic substances like paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen, the first one being the reference drug for tension-type headache in childhood. In case of lacking improvement or side-effects there is demand for an alternative safe substance for the acute analgesic therapy.
