Two years after the diagnosis of Sézary syndrome, a 50-year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet, leading to acral necrosis.

Similar cases have only occasionally been described. The relationship between acral ischemia and T-cell-lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article.
