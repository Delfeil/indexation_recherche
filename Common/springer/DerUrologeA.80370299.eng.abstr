The independent prognostic value of neoplastic extension of renal cell cancer (RCC) into the vena cava inferior has been the subject of several investigations reported to date. However, the use of vena cava thrombosis as an independent prognosticator of a patient's long-term survival is still debated. We have therefore correlated the clinical course of 53 patients with RCC and vena cava thrombosis with a control group consisting of 47 patients with renal cell tumors without vena cava thrombosis (follow-up: 1-154 months). The median long-term survival of patients with and without vena cava thrombosis was 32 and 35 months, respectively. Neither the propagation of the tumor into the vena cava (P = 0.391) nor the cranial extension of the thrombosis (P = 0.158) - even in case of propagation into the right atrium - could be identified as parameters of any prognostic value during univariate or multivariate statistical analysis.
