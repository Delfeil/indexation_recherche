 APC resistance was first discovered in 1993. It is the most frequent cause of thrombophilia in Europe and North America. In more than 90% of cases, the underlying cause of APC resistance is a single point mutation in the factor V gene. Heterozygous patients have a between five- and ten-fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis, while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50- and 100-fold. Where there is a previous history of thrombosis, a careful investigation of the coagulation system, in particular a determination of the APC ratio, is recommended prior to surgery. In patients with APC resistance, a body-weight-specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended. Heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present, while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time. Primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications.
