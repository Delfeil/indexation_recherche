The application of biodegradable implants is combined with advantages and disadvan- tages. They offer a great deal of innovative ideas. Best evaluation has been done with pins for the fixation of low loaded osteochondral fractures. When using 2,7 mm Polypin primary mechanical stabilility of distal radius fractures is comparable with the fixation by 1,8 mm K-wires. A prospective and randomised study with two years follow up, including 183 radial head fractures, showed no significant difference in results and complications in metal and polyactide implants. For this localisation and other comparable indications the implant can be recommended. Despite the more extensive degradable device overall costs can be reduced with the polymer implant. Orien- truded polyactide screws showed good clinical results, newetheless resorption was extremely late within 5 to 7 years.
