A retrospective and partly prospective study was conducted to analyse both clinically and cephalometrically the craniofacial growth pattern of patients with isolated and syndrome-related premature craniosynostosis after standardized fronto-orbital and midface advancement. The file data of 293 children with fronto-orbital advancement were evaluated over an average period of 4.4 years. In addition, lateral teleradiographies of 117 patients from this group were cephalometrically analysed. Moreover, late results of 36 children and  8 adults with midface-advancement with an average follow-up period of 4.5 years were assessed. In contrast to linear craniectomy and so-called lateral canthal advancement, in only 8.2% of cases (24 out of 293 patients) were relapses requiring reoperation found in this study after fronto-orbital advancement. The evaluations indicate that with simple forms of craniosynostosis such as trigonocephaly and plagiocephaly predominantly very good or good growth can be observed. Cephalometric evaluation confirmed the limited potential of growth in the area of the anterior skull base and in the midface in the presence of syndrome-related faciocraniosynostoses. In such cases the cephalometrically confirmed maxillary hypoplasia, which increases in severity in the following order of syndromes `Saethre-Chotzen-Crouzon-Apert-Pfeiffer', could be influenced only to a limited degree by fronto-orbital advancement. For this reason midface advancement is of secondary importance in children with very severe anomalies. In the present evaluation, a high rate of relapse of midfacial hypoplasia was to be found in children and adolescents after this operation in accordance with other references. Therefore, the indication for Le Fort III osteotomy in the growth period should be limited.
