Central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients. In most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli. Despite the introduction of hypocoagulative drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about 10 % in trauma patients. Estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too. In haemodynamically symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated, mortality rates of up to 93 % are reported in literature. After introduction of the heart- and lung-machine in the surgical concept of therapy, survival rates have increased significantly. We report on three cases of successful surgical embolectomy after CPR. In a review of literature current concepts of treatment in central pulmonary embolism are discussed.
