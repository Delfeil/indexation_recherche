 Osteomyelitis can be subdivided into a bacterial exogenic (post-traumatic/postoperative), bacterial endogenic (hematogenous) and an abacterial type, including the rare group containing primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis, which is typically localized in the clavicle. In a review of the literature, the criteria for the various types of chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are analyzed. Out of a group of 17 patients with osteomyelitis of the clavicle treated between 1978 and 1996, three cases of primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are demonstrated. In the differential diagnosis, primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle has to be taken into consideration despite its rareness. After establishing a diagnosis by biopsy, in contrast to the other forms, drug therapy will be the treatment of choice and not an operation.
