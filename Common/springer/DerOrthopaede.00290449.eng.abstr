In literature, the results of hip arthroplasty in patients with avascular osteonecrosis of the femoral head vary. The main reason may be the nonhomogeneous patient groups concerning etiology of the femoral head necrosis (FHN). Analyzing the results of hip endoprosthesis in relation to the etiology of FHN leads to the assumption that steroid-induced FHN and FHN with underlying systemic bone diseases (renal osteodystrophy, sickle-cell hemoglobinopathy) have the highest loosening rates. Diseases with immunosuppressive medication and sickle-cell hemoglobinopathy have the highest risk of joint infection. Therefore etiology plays an important role in the long-term results of hip endoprostheses in FHN. Modern cement techniques of the second generation and new non-cemented total hip endoprostheses seem to have better results than older prostheses and cement techniques. We followed-up 52 non-cemented thrust plate prostheses in 45 patients with FHN, prospectively, for at least 2 years (3.7  +/-  1.6 years). The revision rate was 9.6 % (two aseptic loosenings in one patient with renal osteodystrophy and one patient with alcohol abuse, as well as three late infections in one patient with alcohol abuse and two patients with renal osteodystrophy). Additionally, five prostheses showed radiologic lines of a minimum of 2 mm. Future studies with longer follow-up are needed to find out whether these prosthetic designs with proximal fixation of the femoral component preserving the diaphysial bone have advantages in young FHN patients.
