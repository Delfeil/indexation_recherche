The disturbance of generalized cheerfulness (serene-calmness disorder) is an illness, which is often recognised very late. It is characterised by a uniformity of psychic experience in the face of circumstances which would otherwise give cause for depressiveness, despair, great anxiety, self-accusations or aggression directed against others. Early diagnosis and specific therapy may decisively improve life-quality of the patients and may also prevent detrimental individual and social long-term consequences.
