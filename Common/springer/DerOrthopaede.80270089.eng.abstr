Calciumphosphate-ceramics have been intensively investigated as bone replacement materials for more than twenty years. In consequence to numerous experimental as well as clinical implantations Tricalciumphosphate-ceramic and Hydroxyapatite-ceramic proved to be the most suitable substances. Nevertheless, due to several shortcomings, these synthetic bone replacement materials can up to now in no way replace autogenous bone, the 'golden standard', for all indications of the clinical setting. The reason for this is that despite our ever increasing knowledge of materials' and host bed properties we still are unable to securely predict the outcome after the implantation of such synthetic substitutes. The article reviews the most important biological reactions in mammals and explains the underlying causes.
