 The academic title "Privatdozent", unique to the German speaking countries, is awarded after the "Habilitation", a qualification to teach and perform research on a high level and independent of supervision by a professor. A few years after the "Habilitation", committees of medical faculties decide whether the title "ausserplanmaessiger Professor" can be awarded. This is an academic title independent of a specific university or extramural position. The rules of all German medical faculties were evaluated with regard to when and by what criteria the faculties decide. There were major differences, e. g. the minimum time after the "Habilitation" (4 years n = 9; 5 years n = 14; 6 years n = 7), the numbers and quality of published papers and abstracts, the amount and quality of teaching and the number and qualification of external reviewers. For applications for university positions, but even more for leading positions in hospitals and industry, the title of "apl. Prof." is still of major relevance. Therefore a certain degree of standardization but still leaving space for special criteria in different faculties, is proposed.
