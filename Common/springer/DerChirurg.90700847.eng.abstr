 Biomaterials and related process engineering in order to obtain optimal surface and structural biocompatibility of implants and devices are presented. Vital-avital composites for tissue engineering, cell culture models, porous ceramics and degradable polymers are introduced as examples. Emphasis is laid on the conversion of basic research results into clinical applications and on the exchange of technologies from the non-medical into the medical field and vice versa.
