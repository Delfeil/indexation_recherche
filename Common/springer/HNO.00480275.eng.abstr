Facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis. In the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated. Twenty healthy subjects underwent four neuromyographic tests at intervals of one week. The study group consisted of 12 males and 8 females. Ages ranged from 23 to 36 years. The stimulation intensity required for supramaximal stimulation was 14.6 mA on average. The mean of the intra-individual side-to-side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32.5%. Results of the four repeated tests ranged from no to 80% side-to-side differences in the same individual. The hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data. As with previous investigators we found significant side-to-side differences in healthy subjects. Furthermore, we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements. We conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography.
