To evaluate signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction, over a period of 31 months all patients treated for more than 14 days in our intensive care unit (ICU) had clinical and electrophysiological examination. The results of 78 patients were analysed: 53 had diseases of the central nervous system, 25 suffered from general cerebral hypoxia, mainly after cardiopulmonary reanimation. 54 showed bilateral signs of denervation activity, additionally 10 patients had fibrillation potentials unilateral to their spastic hemiparesis. 19 patients had denervation potentials only in proximal muscles of the upper limbs. Generalized denervation activity developed mainly after septic organ failure. On the other hand 35 patients showed denervation potentials already between day 14 and 21, suggesting an affection of peripheral nerve function in the first week of ICU treatment. Time course, pattern of distribution and frequency of electrophysiological abnormalities are not generally consistent with alterations of nutrition, metabolism or hypoxia in the course of ICU treatment. Clinical signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction were present in 40% of the patients showing denervation in the EMG.
