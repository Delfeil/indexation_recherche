Abstract.  A 51-year-old male patient with histologically confirmed eruptive xanthomatosis is presented. Routine and special laboratory examinations showed complex disturbances of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, the latter taking the form of classic hyperlipoproteinaemia type IV. Combined oral antilipaemic drugs including acipimox (methylpyrazine carboxylic acid analogue of nicotinic acid) and a low-fat diet resulted in regression of the skin symptoms and normalization of the serum lipid levels.
