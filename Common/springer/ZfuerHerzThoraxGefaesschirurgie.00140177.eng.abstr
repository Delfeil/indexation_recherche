 Venous bypass grafts undergo severe changes in their wall structure when introduced into arterial circuit. The Biocompound Graft, a compliant mesh tubing in which the patients varicose vein is sheathed, is used to improve the resistance of the tissue against the pressure-induced degenerative process. In this experimental animal study the investigation of morphological changes and biocompatibility of the Biocompound Graft after exposition to arterial pressure in the first 30 postoperative days was the aim. Histological section and investigation of different parts of each graft were taken. The trial shows the postoperative damage of the intimal layer. At the Biocompound Graft the development of graft sclerosis is seen in the first 30 days after exposure to the arterial pressure like in native vein graft sclerosis. These changes are local. Myocytial and intimal proliferation was found in all sections. There were parts with small wall thickness and slight damage of the intimal layer, but also parts with maximal changes, diminished myointimal proliferation and distinctive damage of intimal layer. The ultimately reason for these different endothelial damages changes are unknown.
