Concepts in the treatment of craniomaxillofacial fractures have changed over the last 15 years. Modern imaging techniques have become a central part in establishing a proper diagnosis. Advanced life support and intensive care medicine allow for early primary fracture treatment. The former principles of minimal exposure of bone fragments using small incisions have been replaced by principles from reconstructive craniofacial surgery comprising extensive subperiosteal dissection, exposure of all fracture lines, open reduction and rigid internal fixation. Missing bony structures are replaced primarily by autogenous bone grafts. Using these concepts, most late esthetic and functional sequelae of facial fractures can be diminished remarkably.
