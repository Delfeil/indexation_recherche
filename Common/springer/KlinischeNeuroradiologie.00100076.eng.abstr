Abstract:  The combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex. However, this method is technically pretentious and time consuming. Therefore, functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery. The aim of the presented study was the development of a protocol, which allows the integration of functional MEG data into presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation, as a routine method.
