The results of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 confirm allergies as widespread diseases in Germany. In total 40 to 43 % of the adult population have or have had an allergic disease. The morbidity was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire and a personal interview performed by a physician. The agreement between questionnaire and interview data is greater than 90 % for allergic rhinitis, food allergy and urticaria and about 80 % for contact dermatitis and asthma. The results of both assessment methods showed remarkable differences between East and West Germany. Using the interview data 17 % of the West but only 11 % of the East German adults have/had e.g. an allergic rhinitis. Comparable differences exist for contact dermatitis. Many people with allergies suffer or have suffered from several allergies. Frequent patterns of combination are food allergy/allergic rhinitis and asthma/allergic rhinitis. In comparison with former studies we observed an increase of 70 % in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis between 1990/92 and 1998. The relative increase is higher in East than in West. The time trend in prevalence of asthma could only be calculated for the West German population. The results show a remarkable increase here, too.
