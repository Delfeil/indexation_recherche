During general anaesthesia even healthy lungs tend to collapse. Thus, up to 20% of previously functional lung tissue may be lost for gas exchange. It should be advantageous to treat this pathologic condition. After explaining the clinical problem of lung collapse, the concept of opening these lungs and keeping them open will be discussed. Some results of the first randomized clinical trials on intraoperative lung recruitment will be presented. Finally, a systematic description of all treatment steps tries to provide the anaesthesiologist with a useful practical guide for applying the "alveolar recruitment strategy" in their daily care of patients undergoing general anaesthesia.
