About 25 % of operated clubfeet will develop a recurrency or show a marked residual deformity. As main factor the failure of concentric reduction at the time of initial surgery has to be considered. Residual forefoot adduction and supination are the most common persistent deformities. Based on the experience with 94 recurrent/residual clubfeet (patients < 10 years) the surgical treatment at different age-groups is presented. As a general rule soft tissue release is applicable as a repeated procedure until the age of about eight to ten years. For revision in patients between two and eight years we recommend a closing wedge osteotomy of the cuboid and a tibialis transfer additional to repeated release-procedures. In patients older than eight to ten years mid-tarsal osteotomies, correction according to Ilizarov with the external fixator or triple arthrodesis are to be considered as single or combined procedures.
