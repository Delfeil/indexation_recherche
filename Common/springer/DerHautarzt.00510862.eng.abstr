Neurofibromatosis is a neuroectodermal systemic disease. A rare variant of this condition is bilateral segmental neurofibromatosis. A 29-year-old man presented with bilateral papillomatous plaques in the lumbar dermatomes. Clinically, the lesions were very similar to an epidermal nevus but histologic examination revealed superficial neurofibromas. Family history, ophthalmologic and neurologic investigations were unremarkable. The unusual morphologic presentation of bilateral segmental neurofibromas in this case points to the wide clinical spectrum of the disease and the significance of histologic examination in systematic nevoid lesions.
