 A 55-year-old female patient developed a severe chronic lumbar pain syndrome over a period of 17 years. An intervertebral disc operation was performed 5 years after the start of the painful illness. The patient later developed resistance to therapy and was unable to stand or walk. She was confined to bed and wheelchair and socially completely withdrawn. Drug therapy and invasive therapeutic techniques escalated. An intrathecal catheter for morphine administration had to be removed owing to bacterial meningitis, and repeated malfunction led to several revisions of an epidural catheter. Withdrawal of the morphine therapy, carried out with the patient's agreement, was complicated by an epileptic seizure and an acute circulatory failure with cerebral hypoxia. The succeeding severe amnestic syndrome extinguished all recollection of the last 20 years, including the entire course of the painfull illness. The patient could then be mobilised without pain. Consistent care avoided a relapse into the pain syndrome as the amnestic syndrome gradually receded. The patient was fully able to accept responsibility and not longer required special pain therapy. The course demonstrates that chronic pain disorders of a predominantly psychodynamic, and therefore corticocerebral, genesis are dependent on an intact memory. In such cases memory failure can induce pain relief.
