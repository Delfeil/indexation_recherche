Turnaround time for analysis of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) by standard laboratory methods ranges between 40 min and several hours. The delay in obtaining the test results limits their clinical utility for treatment of perioperative coagulation disorders and adequate anti-coagulation therapy. In this study, we compared on-site coagulation testing (OCT) of whole blood, which takes about 3 min, with standard laboratory plasma coagulation tests by our institutional laboratory (LAB) to assess the accuracy of the OCT in a clinical setting (abdominal and postcardiac surgery).
