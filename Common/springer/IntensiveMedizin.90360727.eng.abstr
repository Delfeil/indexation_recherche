 Prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians. Acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain. The basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia, the clinical symptoms, the diagnostic tools and the preclinically available therapeutic options. Time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30-60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in 3 to 6 hours. With 30% of patients dying within the first hour of ischemia mostly due to ventricular arrhyhtmias every effort needs to be made to shorten the delay between symptom onset and start of reperfusion therapy. The present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of preclincial diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or PTCA.
