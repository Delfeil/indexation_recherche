Magnetic Resonance imaging with its excellent soft tissue contrast represents the method of choice for examination of intraarticular and periarticular structures of joints. However, conventional MR-imaging without intraarticular contrast application is not suitable for the diagnosis of labral lesions. MR-arthrography (MRA) of the hip clearly demonstrates labral pathology by distension of the joint space and entrance of the contrast medium into the lesion. Multiplanar 3-D-gradient echo sequences enable visualisation of the most important cranio-ventral portion of the labrum. With the MRA labral lesions can be subdivided into different, clinically relevant stages. Furthermore accompanying lesions (intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress-bone marrow-edema) can be demonstrated. In our study including operatively verified cases, MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90 %) and accuracy (91 %) in detecting labral lesions. So far no complication occurred with more than 100 MRA's. Therefore this technique represents the method of choice for the radiological evaluation of labral lesions of the hip joint. In this review the technical details and results of our MRA method will be presented.
