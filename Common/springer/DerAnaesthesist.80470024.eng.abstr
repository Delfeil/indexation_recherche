Treatment of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be life-saving but requires maximal use of intensive care resources over prolonged periods of time, resulting in high costs. Little is known about the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in long-term survivors. This case-controlled retrospective study was designed to assess the health-related quality of life in long-term survivors of ARDS and ECMO-therapy.
