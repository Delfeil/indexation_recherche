Purpose: In cases of esotropia combined with a high AC/A ratio, partly accommodative convergence excess or with nonaccommodative convergence excess, two methods of surgical therapy are possible: recession of the medial recti (Parks) and retroequatorial myopexy (Cüppers). Our aim was to answer the question whether retroequatorial myopexy alone and in combination with bimedial recession are appropriate methods of reducing the strabismic angle at near and distant fixation to values under 10 PD and near-distance disparity to less than 10 PD to form the basis for single binocular vision without bifocals.
