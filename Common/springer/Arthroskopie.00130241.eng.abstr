Problem: In the present study, we evaluated the failure and revisions rates after arthroscopic subacromial decompression (SAD). Method: We examined 70 patients who were treated with arthroscopic subacromial decompression for primary shoulder impingement stage II according to Neer at an average follow-up time of 30 months. Hereby, special attention was paid to the revision operations resulting from our treatment. Results: Revision operation had to be performed in nine patients (13%). Reasons for revisions were persisting or increasing pain as well as functional dissatisfaction. At the follow-up examination, six of these revised patients (66%) were satisfied with the result. The mean follow-up CONSTANT score in the revised patients was 80.3 (SD  +/-  15.4). In patients with impingement stage II, the mean follow-up CONSTANT score was 84.7 (SD  +/-  16.7). In 60% of the revised patients, the necessity for revision operation was directly related to the technical problems of the primary operation, in 40% we found reasons not related to the primary SAD. Conclusions: Technical failures are the most common cause for the need of revision operations after SAD. This demonstrates how demanding this kind of operation procedure is. In case of revision operations, individual strategies should be developed in which the decision of whether to perform arthroscopic or open revision procedures is of special importance.
