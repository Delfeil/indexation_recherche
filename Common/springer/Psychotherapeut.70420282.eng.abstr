The training status of psychotherapists in Germany and Switzerland is described and the relationship between training experiences and the therapists' feelings of competence are analysed. Within the framework of the International Study of the Professional Development of Psychotherapists 1065 persons answered a comprehensive questionnaire. Most of these psychotherapists are highly experienced and well trained; in general, they continue with additional training after the completion of their first specialized training. Clinical confidence and self-efficacy expectancies can best be explained by practice features, positive experiences with courses and seminars resp. personal therapy and the training status. A broad theoretical orientation is of additional value.
