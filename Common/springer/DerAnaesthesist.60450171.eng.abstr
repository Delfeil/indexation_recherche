A 3.5-year-old girl suffered from a thermal injury affecting 37% of the body surface area. The parents, being Jehovah's witnesses, refused permission for their child to receive blood transfusions. As the haemoglobin level was only 7.5% and a necrectomy was planned, the patient was likely to need blood transfusions. Indications for transfusion were defined as clinical signs of hypoxia and/or cardiovascular instability. A judicial declaration was proposed. Hb decreased during the therapy. To stimulate the erythropoiesis erythropoietin and iron were administered. During the clinical course the anaemia worsened. First, a conservative treatment with polyvidoniodine ointment for tanning was started, to avoid an operation during the acute phase after the injury, as in this case it was thought a blood transfusion would definitely be necessary. On the 19th day after the injury a necrectomy of 10% of the body surface was necessary because of fever and leucocytosis not responding to antibiotics. The most likely cause of the symptoms was an infection of the burned area. Hb was 4.6 g/dl%. General anaesthesia was performed with midazolam, ketamine and vecuronium and mechanical ventilation. No blood transfusion was required during the operation.Vital signs were stable during the preoperative period, during anaesthesia and following the operation. There were no signs of tissue hypoxia. Peripheral oxygen saturation ranged between 98% and 100%, lactate and arterial blood gas samples were normal, and the child was awake and cooperative before and after anaesthesia. The lowest Hb was 3.3 g/dl on the 22th day after injury (3rd postoperative day). In this phase the patient was still playing and riding a tricycle. On the 45th day after injury the child was discharged home with Hb of 10.9 g/dl and reticulocytosis of 33%.
