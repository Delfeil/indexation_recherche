 An accurate assessment of the duration of the ability to act following fatal poisoning can be of major importance in reconstructing circumstances leading to death, especially in determining whether the poisoning was accidental, self-inflicted, or the result of a criminal act. Clinical publications have scarcely dealt with this problem. We therefore examined 20 legal autopsies performed at the Institutes of Forensic Medicine of the Universities of Würzburg and Leipzig as well as the respective records of the police and prosecuting attorney's offices in an effort to clarify this question. As a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10-15 min. However, the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer. The present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication.
