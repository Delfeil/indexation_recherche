  Geriatric assessment is a means to collect health and functional data of an individual older person in a standard way. It has been developed on the secondary care level in the specialties of geriatric and rehabilitative medicine. Transferring geriatric assessment into primary care may improve health outcomes of older people, especially as it facilitates preventive diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. Yet, it is not possible to use geriatric assessment, as it is carried out in secondary care, under primary care conditions. Several adaptations will be necessary. An assessment instrument will have to be developed which takes epidemiological features of the older population into account. It will have to tailored to the specific conditions of health delivery in primary care. Moreover, to achieve effectiveness and acceptance by health care providers and users, we see the necessity of creating an algorithmic assessment instrument which allows the use in different health situations with different levels of diagnostic detail. A primary care assessment for older people then would need to be evaluated according to its effectiveness of improving health outcomes. Potential negative effects on health beliefs may be worth considering. The final task lies in the implementation of a primary care assessment instrument into our existing health delivery format.
