Inborn errors of the urea cycle and of the organic acid metabolism can cause acute hyperammonemia in neonates which, if untreated, leads to coma, severe brain damage or death. These complications, however, can be prevented by proper diagnosis and early therapeutic intervention. Rapid decline in ammonia blood levels are essential and can be achieved by the following four therapeutic principles 1. restriction of protein intake (while maintaining essential amino acids), 2. reduction of protein catabolism by a hypercaloric diet, 3. activation of alternative pathways of ammonia elimination, and 4. elimination of ammonia from the circulation by dialysis.
