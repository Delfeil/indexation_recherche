Background. Renal studies have a long tradition in nuclear medicine and are available for routine use for more than 30 years. Their high clinical acceptance is mainly based upon the fact that they allow for quantitative evaluation of different functional parameters such as glomerular filtration, effective renal plasma flow, or postrenal transport. The used methods are validated by experimental as well as numerous clinical studies and are performed throughout the world in a highly standardized way.
