The definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp. At present all non-physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors, are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature. Many pesticides or insecticides or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and pollute our surface water. Here they may cause severe estrogenization of aquatic life. Only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water. On the other hand, weak estrogens present in plastic ware may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health. On the other hand, many plants produce socalled'hyto-estrogens', particularly soy products are rich in phyto-estrogens but their high consumption in Asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer. Many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto-estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of climacteric complaints. Hence, not all endocrine disruptors must be harmful to human health, in fact, some of them (clearly phyto-estrogens) may have beneficial effects.
