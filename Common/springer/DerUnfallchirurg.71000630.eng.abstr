Between January 1989 and July 1992, 76 patients with thoracolumbar fractures were operatively treated at the Department of Trauma Surgery, Hannover Medical School. After a mean of more than 3 years, 56 of 62 patients (90 %) still alive who had their implants removed were examined. According to the ASIF classification 33 patients sustained type A fractures, 13 type B and 10 type C. Three patients with incomplete paraplegia returned to normal; in one case of complete paraplegia no change occurred. In 40 cases the dorsal instrumentation was combined with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting. The mean operative time totaled 3 h. In this series, two complications (3.6 %) were observed: one iatrogenic vertebral arch fracture without consequences and one deep infection. Compared to the preoperative status, our follow-up examinations demonstrated permanent physical and social sequelae: the percentage of individuals able to do physical labor was reduced by half (22 to 11 patients) whereas the share of unemployed or retired patients doubled (4 to 8 patients). At the time of follow-up examination only 21 of 42 patients continued in sports. The assessment of complaints and functional outcome with the "Hannover Spinal Trauma Score" reflected a significant difference (P < 0.001) between the status before injury (96.6/100 points) and at the time of follow-up (71.4/100 points).
