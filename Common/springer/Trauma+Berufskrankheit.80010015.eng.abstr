Because the overall results of conservative treatment for distal radial fractures have been unsatisfactory, it is rarely used. However, minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous K-wire pinning are being increasingly used. A justified indication for the use of K-wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short- and long-term anatomic and functional results. Short-term supplementary immobilization with a minimized plaster cast or protective external fixation is generally considered to be useful. Reports on plaster-free functional treatment after K-wire pinning have been published. The indications therefore need to be further specified. Follow-up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in K-wire stabilization and good-to-very good results in 75% of the cases.
