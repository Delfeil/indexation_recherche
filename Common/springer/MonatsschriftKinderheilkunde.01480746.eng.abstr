Recombinant growth hormone (rGH) therapy in the treatment of children with short stature was introduced 10 years ago, and experience has shown that progress in implementing this mode of therapy depends increasingly on analyses of large pharmaco-epidemiological studies. These studies prove that the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency, whatever the cause or pathogenetic form, is the most frequent indication for GH therapy. The remaining problems are timely and precise diagnosis, and the best possible and individual therapy aiming at the projected height and taking safety and costs into account. We are closer to solving these problems today than ever before. Apart from this, the use of GH in treating short stature in Turner syndrome and renal insufficiency has led to its acceptance as a suitable therapy for these patients. Height improvement in a number of other growth disorders is, in certain cases, also possible through GH therapy. In the light of current experience, GH therapy can thus be attempted on a rational basis in individual cases. This form of treatment clearly holds wider possibilities and its implementation is likely to go beyond short stature in the future.
