Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Obstetric Hospital and the School of Midwifery at Kiel/Germany, is known as one of the founders of scientific obstetrics. In research and teaching he was oriented towards empirical data. His most important scientific work on the narrow pelvis sums up his experience as an obstetrician. Pelvimetry and the inspection of the so-called "Michaelis-rhomboid" predict the prognosis of the process of birth. He was a conscientious researcher: he self-critically published unsuccessful cases and thoroughly considered new theories. In Germany he was the first to prove Semmelweis' theory of the prophylaxis of puerperal sepsis to be true. When he realised that he had caused the death of so many women in childbirth, Michaelis was desperate and committed suicide in 1848.
