 The probability of adverse and undesirable events during and after operations that have not yet occurred in a finite number of patients (n) can be estimated using Hanley's simple formula, which gives the upper limit of the 95 % confidence interval for the probability of such an event: Maximum risk = upper limit of 95 % confidence interval = 3/n (for n > 30).
