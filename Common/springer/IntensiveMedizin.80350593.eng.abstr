 Acute aortic dissection is an emergency situation, and the diagnosis must be confirmed as soon as possible because of high early mortality. Severe, persistent chest pain of sudden onset is characteristic. Transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and aortography have comparable diagnostic accuracy with advantages and disadvantages, which are discussed in this overview. Echocardiography in aortic dissection can detect an intimal flap, intimal tears, the true and false lumen, complications such as pericardial and pleural effusions, aortic insufficiency, and involvement of the coronary arteries. Treatment includes the hemodynamic stabilization, simultaneous reduction of the systolic blood pressure, and reduction of the pulsatile aortic flow (shear stress). All acute dissections involving the ascending aorta should be treated promptly with surgery. For dissections arising in the descending aorta, surgical treatment may be delayed until the hypertension and dissection have been stabilized. Permanent medical treatment may be offered in patients with type B dissections which tend to be poor surgical risks.
