Treatment of degenerative gonarthritis is one of the main fields of arthroscopy. Different treatment possibilities are discussed considering recent literature, especially concerning dependence of indication on degree of chondromalacia, success and structural changes. Experimental stability testing shows increased translation in gonarthritis as a sign of instability. Partial resection of the posterior meniscal horns lead to considerable loss of stability, causing cartilage defects if no muscular compensation takes place. Finally, treatment methods for cartilage restoration are compared.
