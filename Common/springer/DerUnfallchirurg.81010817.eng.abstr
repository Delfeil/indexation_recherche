We report our results after primary implantation of 30 radial head prostheses in a retrospective study from 1978 to 1996. If there was intraoperatively a remaining instability of the elbow after resection of the radial head, we implanted a prosthesis. The average age of our patients was 40.7 years. The results were evaluated concerning the recommendations of Radin and Riseborough. In 22 patients (73 %) we found good to satisfactory results, in 8 patients (27 %), there was a free range of motion. Heterotopic ossifications with a remarkable decrease in the range of motion were discovered in 3 patients (10 %). The implant had to be removed in three (10 %) patients (2 incorrect implantations, one broken prosthesis). To conclude, the primary implantation of a radial head prosthesis after a strict indication improves the clinical benefit for the patient. A correct surgical technique avoids unneccessary complications.
