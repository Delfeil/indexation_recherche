Nowadays scientific publishing in peer reviewed international accepted journals is not easy. Rejection rates up to 75 % occur. The aim of this paper is to provide guidance in the preparation of journal papers for the unexperienced scientific writer. The traditional paragraphs Abstract, Introduction, Material and Methods, Results, and Discussion are described with respect to its contents and basic message and how these sections are designed to build a logical flow. Approved suggestions for the structural outline of each paragraph are made. The significance of reference list, figures, and tables is also explained. The review of a manuscript is discussed and the criterias for acceptance of a journal paper are indicated.
