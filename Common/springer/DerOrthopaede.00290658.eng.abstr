Computer-assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures. Several reports on clinical results of computer-aided screw insertion in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as well as the sacro-iliac joints are available. They show a significant decrease of screw malplacement rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques.
