Objectives: A reduction of muscle tone in rats can be found after intraperitoneal or intrathecal injection of flupirtine in analgetic doses. However, a muscle-relaxing effect in patients with spasticity has not yet been shown. In this study we investigated whether flupirtine can reduce the increased muscle tone in patients with spasticity.
