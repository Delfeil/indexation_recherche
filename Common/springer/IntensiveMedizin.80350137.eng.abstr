The early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare. Although it is a simple procedure, it is not a minor operation. Users must be familiar with the technique, the indications and contra-indications for the procedure, as well as the complications. These are described. Proper training of the operation and knowledge of the procedure will avoid unnecessary complications.
