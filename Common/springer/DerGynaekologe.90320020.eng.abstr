For maintaining quality, both in- and outhospital delivery units should provide well-defined minimal requirements. For delivery units the recommendations of obstetrical societies regarding space, structure and proceedings should be considered. Legal problems arise because of organization, cooperation, instruction, documentation and treatment failures. This publication contains recommendations to avoid such failures. National perinatal statistics, internal and external questionnaires regarding patient satisfaction, and the analysis of individual performance are all factors that are independent of the place of delivery and are suitable instruments for obstetrical quality control and improvement.
