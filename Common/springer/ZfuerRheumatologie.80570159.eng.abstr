 Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a rarely recognized infectious disease in Germany. Only a few years ago the causative agent, Bartonella henselae, could be isolated. The typical clinical manifestations of CSD consist of skin changes at the inoculation site and a benign lymphadenopathy; other manifestations are rare. We report the case of a 47 year old woman, who developed a reactive spondylarthropathy with synovitis of finger joints, polyarthralgias of large- and medium-sized joints, and inflammatory spinal pain after a cat bite. The rheumatic manifestations resolved after 10 months by treatment with non-steroidal antirheumatic drugs. Only a few cases of rheumatic manifestations associated with CSD have been described in the literature. Because the prevalence of Bartonella henselae infection of cats is high in Europe, rheumatic manifestations might be more frequent. Diagnosis of CSD is now improved by the development of serological tests. We provide an overview of the clinical manifestations and the diagnostic criteria.
