Continuing medical education for ophthalmologist is important and demanded from the board of ophthalmic organizations. The use of new multimedia possibilities provided by the internet, offers an anlternative to acquire the training sessions requested by the board. Aim of the paper is to show the efforts made, to place an internet-based training website for ophthalmologists by transferring live ophthalmology events via the Internet. The live-transfers of selected lectures is ralized by transferring the original sound compatible to the software "Real-Audio-Player" with an rate of 8000 Hz (encoding-depth14 bits). By using this software it is possible to follow the lectures live. It includes also 2 live-pictures of 2 digital camcorders to show the appropriate slides from the lecturer. The live broadcasted lectures were afterwards revised and are available at any time as "on-demand lectures" with original sound and slides. Since November 1997, 15 continuing medical education events for ophthalmologists of the University Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany and frrom other universities were live broadcasted covering all aspects of phthalmology can be viewed as "on-demand lectures" with original-sound and slides under the internet-addresse.
