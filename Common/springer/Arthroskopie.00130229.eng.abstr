Open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard. But arthroscopic techniques show also good and comparable results. Arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases. Therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization. This prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization.
