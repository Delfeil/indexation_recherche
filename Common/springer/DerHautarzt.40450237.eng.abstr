Abstract.  A case with various skeletal abnormalities, soft tissue masses and skin lesions diagnosed as Proteus syndrome is reported. Proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders, because of the polymorphous nature of its clinical manifestations. It is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems. Early diagnosis and careful follow-up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long-term complications.
