Sperm-autoantibodies in the male result mainly from violation of the epididymis or the ductus deferens. Our knowledge on the corresponding antigens is incomplete, but sperm antibodies may interfere with different sperm functions. The MAR test (mixed-antiglobulin-reaction) is the most suitable method of demonstrating the presence of sperm antibodies. Treatment with corticosteroids is questionable, as the aim of treatment should not be to treat sperm antibodies, but to treat the fertility problem. In order to achieve fertilization, the same techniques of reproductive medicine are applied as in any other cause of infertility. Today mainly in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) is performed.
