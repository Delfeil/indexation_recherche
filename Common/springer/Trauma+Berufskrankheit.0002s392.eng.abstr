Fractures of the metacarpal bones are rarely reported in growing children. Compression fractures affecting the metaphyses and epiphysial separations are the most frequent types in the central area of the hand, usually with a metaphyseal outbreak wedge. Genuine Bennet and Rolando fractures do not occur in children whose joints are still open. As with every other fracture treatment, therapy should be efficient and give an optimal result with minimum expenditure. A definitive primary therapy is the best method of treatment, but redislocations can make therapy changes necessary. This was the case in 4 of our 64 patients. There are not many treatment procedures that can be considered for metacarpal fractures in children: different types of plaster cast and Kirschner wires are the only methods used. Fractures with no dislocation are treated only by means of plaster casts. With dislocations the spontaneous correction that can be expected must of course be considered. These mainly affect younger children and axial malalignments in the sagittal plane. In the case of dislocation fractures every effort should be made to provide emergency care within the first 6 h after the accident.
