 Diagnosis of an entrapped thrombus in a patent foramen ovale without preceding arterial embolism is rare. We report an intensive care patient in whom TEE was performed because pulmonary embolism was suspected. Surprisingly, the examination not only confirmed the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, but also revealed an elongated highly mobile mass overriding a patent foramen ovale, with large parts protruding both into the left and the right atrium. This was suspected to be of thromboembolic origin. The patient underwent emergent surgery which confirmed the initial diagnosis, and embolectomy of a 19 cm giant thrombus was performed successfully. Diagnosis of the entrapped thrombus by TEE led to immediate therapeutic intervention preventing further pulmonary or paradoxical embolism.
