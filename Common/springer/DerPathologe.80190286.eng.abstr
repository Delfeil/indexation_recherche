Juvenile pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland represents an extremely rare tumour entity and is comparable to congenital tumours of the salivary glands concerning its embryonal structure. The clinical detection of the tumour in a 7-year-old girl does not exclude that the tumour had developed either earlier or immediately after the birth. The high cellularity and the evidence of primitive epithelial and myoepithelial cellular structures do not justify its classification as a malignant tumour. However the presence of embryonal tissue structures associated with the end of the third month of embryogenesis is characterized by more solid cell formations in partly verticillate arrangement. The absence of further differentiation into lobular structures and differentiated duct or acinic cell formations may be due to cell arrest. Differential diagnosis of juvenile pleomorphic adenoma must distinguished it from other congenital salivary gland tumours (e.g. congenital basal cell adenoma, hybrid basal cell adenoma - adenoid cystic carcinoma, sialoblastoma, salivary gland anlage tumour).
