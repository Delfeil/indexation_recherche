Abstract.  Dislocated metacarpal V fractures, fixed by percutaneous Kirschner wires or other implants near the metacarpophalangeal joint, often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings. We therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to Foucher. Twenty-five patients were operated on in a 3-year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined. Six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction. One patient suffering from an early stage of Sudeck's dystrophy was healed, and no other complications appeared. Three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment. We therefore recommend intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal V fractures.
