Extracorporal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment. We have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method. In a prospective nonrandomized study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of 6 months. Following 2 cycles of ESWT with 2000 impulses/18 kV, the reevaluation was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment. A total of 27 pseudarthroses was reevaluated, in 11 one or more reosteosyntheses had been performed prior to ESWT. Following ESWT we found a success rate of 41 % (n = 11). The clinical evidence of subjective, clinical improvement was found in 5 of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within a period of 3 months. Radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within 6 months. ESWT appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion. If no improvement occurs, the maximum delay of reosteosynthesis is three months.
