Type I allergies to latex have become an increasing problem in occupational dermatology during the past few years, especially since at least 10% of health care workers are affected. In the Department of Dermatology, University Erlangen-Nuremberg, a 12-fold increase in latex-allergic patients has been documented between 1989 and 1995 with a clear trend to more severe systemic manifestations (from 10.7% in 1989/1990 to 44% in 1994/1995). Among the water soluble proteins (molecular weights 2 to 200 kD) which may induce latex allergy, at least 5 are considered as main proteins with known primary structure. In addition some `marker' proteins seem to induce specific IgE antibodies in special risk groups (e.g. 46 kD-protein in medical professions, 14.6 kD- and 27 kD-proteins in children with spina bifida). Cross reactions between latex and several fruits (especially avocado, kiwi, banana and chestnut) in 60 to 70% of latex-allergic patients have to be taken into account when evaluating and counselling affected patients. Most important in prophylaxis is the complete change to powder-free latex gloves in medical institutions, since these gloves usually have a low protein content. Our listing of surgical and examination gloves according to their protein content (as measured by the modified Lowry- and High Pressure Liquid Chromatography method) should be a useful guideline for the choice of suitable gloves.
