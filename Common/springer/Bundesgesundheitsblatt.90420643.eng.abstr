The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique. However, the expertise required is a major disadvantage. Recently, methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available. The use of an antigen-capture assay for the detection of histidine-rich protein 2, an antigen specific for Plasmodium falciparum, forms the basis of the ParaSight-F (Becton Dickinson) and the ICT Malaria Pf test (ICT Diagnostics). Parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another immunographic dipstick assay developed by Flow Inc. These currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and specificities of 90-100%.  A decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low parasitemia. However, false-negative  results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities.
