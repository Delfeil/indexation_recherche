Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a disease that involves the lining of joints, bursae and tendon sheaths. The incidence is low and estimated to be 1.8 patients per million population. The cause of PVNS is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic. PVNS has been described in 2 forms different for prognosis and treatment (nodular and diffuse). The articular form almost appeares in the knee joint as we describe below in a 14 year-old patient.
