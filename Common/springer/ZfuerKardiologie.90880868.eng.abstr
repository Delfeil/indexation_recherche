 Patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting may develop acute myocardial infarction late after surgery. It is not exactly known in these patients whether acute infarction is predominantly caused by occlusion of bypass or native vessels. Also, there is no systematic and prospective data available with respect to an invasive, revascularizing therapeutic approach. Therefore, acute coronary angiograms were obtained in 21 consecutive patients with acute infarctions and remote bypass grafting to elucidate mechanisms causing myocardial infarction in these patients, and to assess results of catheter-based recanalization.
