The introduction of magnetic resonance (MR) tomography has fundamentally changed radiological diagnosis for many diseases. Invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been widely replaced by noninvasive MR angiography for most of the vascular diseases. The rapid technical development of MR imaging in recent years has opened new functional imaging techniques. MR imaging of the heart allows simultaneous measurement of morphological and functional parameters in a single noninvasive examination without any radiation exposure. Because of the high spatial resolution and the reproducibility cine MR imaging is now the gold standard for functional analysis. With the improvement of myocardial perfusion and viability studies many diseases of the heart can be diagnosed in a single examination. MR spectroscopy is the only method which allows a view of the metabolism of the heart. New examinations for vascular imaging and flow quantification complete the goal of "one-stop-shop" imaging of the heart. MR imaging is the only diagnostic modality which allows a complete evaluation of many diseases of the heart with one technique, basic examination as well as follow-up studies. The very rapid improvement in MRI will overcome most of the limitations in the near future, especially concerning MR coronary angiography.
