Etomidate has become an important induction agent in high-risk patients because of its cardiovascular stability. Its unwanted side-effects such as pain on injection and thrombophlebitis could be significantly reduced by a new (medium chain triglyceride and soya bean) emulsion formulation. Propofol is solved in a mixture of long chain triglyceride and soya bean emulsion. In this double-blind, randomized study we compared the haemodynamic effects, the patients' sensations, signs of thrombophlebitis and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) following injection of both drugs.
