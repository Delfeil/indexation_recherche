 In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described for the first time a new form of inguinal hernia. This hernia varied from the known forms of hernias in its clinical course and in the postmortem examination results performed by Littrè himself. The characteristic feature of this hernia was the fact that the entire circumference of the bowel wall was not part of the hernial sac, but only the antimesenteric part of the intestinal wall. The underlying pathomechanism was explained 100 years later by Meckel. In a scientific paper about hernias some years earlier, Richter described the intestinal wall hernia, and this initiated the confusing use of the clinical entity known as the Richter-Littré hernia in Germany. In this case report we describe the historic development of this entity.
