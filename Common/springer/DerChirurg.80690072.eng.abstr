 In a prospective study the preoperative risk of alcohol addiction was evaluated in 46 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. In all patients the alcohol marker carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) was measured prior to esophagectomy and correlated with the incidence of postoperative withdrawal symptoms (yes/no) and the postoperative course (good/moderate/poor/fatal). Withdrawal symptoms were more frequently observed in cases of elevated CDT values (median of CDT with withdrawal 17.0 U/l vs without withdrawal 10.7 U/l; P = 0.0006). CDT values were significantly increased in case of a complicated postoperative course (median of CDT for moderate/poor/fatal postoperative course 14.0 U/l vs good course 10.8 U/l; P = 0.02). The CDT value correlated (P = 0.04) with the patient's history of preoperative alcohol consumption (normal/increased/high). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis CDT and preoperative alcohol consumption were independent parameters to predict significantly the postoperative course and withdrawal. The sensitivity was 71.4 % and the specifity 84.4 % selecting the parameter "postoperative withdrawal" and a CDT cut-off point of < 15.3 U/l. CDT can effectively identify patients with high alcohol consumption prior to esophagectomy.
