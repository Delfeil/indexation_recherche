Fifty-three patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with atopic eczema and 52 controls with healthy skin were compared with regard to their sexual behavior. For the test, questionnaires developed by Arentewicz as well as our own questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used. Patients with skin diseases had a significantly impaired sex life, compared to those with healthy skin. There was a highly significant reduction in the exchange of tenderness in patients of both sexes, and in the capacity for orgasm in female patients. On the other hand, no significant difference was found concerning the frequency of intercourse. Patients with psoriasis felt more impaired than those with atopic eczema. Ninety-three percent of psoriatics and 96% of patients with atopic eczema had not been asked about their sexual life by their attending doctor. We discuss to what extent skin diseases are possibly involved in the regulation of nearness and distance among partners. The dermatologist should a be knowledgeable and understanding source for patients which skin diseases who have questions about their disease and its effect on their sex life.
