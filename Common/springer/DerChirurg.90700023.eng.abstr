 Perioperative management requires close cooperation between the referring practitioner, anesthesiologist, surgeon, and nursing staff. Standards in diagnostics, risk assessment, and choice of procedure, as well as integration of the anesthesiologist into the surgical outpatient department, are all important prerequisites for the optimum preparation of patients. Elective operations are to be planned in advance, taking into account the surgical resources available. Additional operating rooms with interdisciplinary access should be available for emergency procedures. Turnaraound times between operations can be reduced by separate rooms for pre- and postsurgical preparation and recovery. Small functional units allow for a flexible response to necessary changes in the schedule. These measures increase the quality of treatment and economic efficiency, as well as the satisfaction of patients and staff.
