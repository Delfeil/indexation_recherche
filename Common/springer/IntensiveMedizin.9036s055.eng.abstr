 Mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving procedure in routine intensive care medicine. However, during recent years we have learned that intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation can be associated with quite serious side effects. Therefore, one of the major goals in the management of the mechanically ventilated patient is to liberate the patient from the ventilator at the earliest time possible. In about 20% of all mechanically ventilated patients, the process of weaning is difficult and time consuming so that these patients need a specific weaning technique. It has been shown that the duration of weaning might be shortened and its outcome might be improved when standardized protocols are used to detect the earliest time when a patient is able to breath spontaneously. However, although this evidence suggests that it is in general possible to improve the process of weaning, those studies have not resulted in a clear preference for one or the other weaning method. Both, T-piece trials as well as spontaneous breathing trials with low level pressure support have been successfully used for weaning. Since it is well known that the intubated patients has to overcome an additional breathing workload which is imposed mainly by the endotracheal tube, we have a preference for the spontaneous breathing trials using pressure support to compensate for this added workload.
