 The authors report on a 28 year old female with severe thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura TTP, Morbus Moschcowitz. Initially, it was possible to overcome critical phases with a combination of plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, and Vinca-alcaloids. Later, the patient was stabilized on plasmapheresis alone. Relapses occured after stretching the intervals between the plasmapheresis to more than 4 d. After the 64th plasmapheresis we applied 0.350 mg/kg body weight daily immunglobuline i.v. over 5 d. Thereafter the patient did well over 6 months without relapsing. The current literature according the use of IVIG in TTP is discussed.
