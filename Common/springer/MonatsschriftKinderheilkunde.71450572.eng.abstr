In 80 textbooks of German pediatric literature published from 1803 to 1993, instructions concerning the technique of breast-feeding were studied (time of the first breast-feeding after birth, frequency of breast-feeding and duration of the interval between two meals at night). The actual pediatric recommendations of breast-feeding harmonize with those promoted in the nineteenth century. Between 1905 and 1915 German pediatricians introduced a new strictly regulated schedule of breast-feeding recommending that the first feeding be 24 h after birth, that there be 5 (or 6) feedings per day and none during a period of 8 h at night. This strictly regulated schedule of breast-feeding was revised in 1960-1985 and replaced by instructions for feeding on demand. In a review, the contemporary scientific arguments as well as the psychological and social context promoting and suppressing scheduled feeding are depicted, and the possible consequences of the strictly regulated schedule of breast-feeding on infant-feeding practices and the manner of interaction of pediatrician with both mother and infant are discussed.
