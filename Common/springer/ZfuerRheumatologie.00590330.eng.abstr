 Case-reports from two female patients with an occlusion of the right external iliac artery and femoral artery are presented due to a large-vessel vasculitis. Both patients suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus This rare manifestation occured within the first few years of the disease and was important for prognosis and further treatment. Other manifestations of the disease were general symptoms and polyarthritis. In one case the vascultitis was confirmed by histology.   A fibrous thickening of the intima and a vasculitis of small vessels within the adventitia were the prominent feature. This observation supports the idea of small vessel vasculitis as the characteristic manifestation in lupus erythematosus.
