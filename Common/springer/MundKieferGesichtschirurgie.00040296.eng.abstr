The aim of the study was the prospective cephalometric analysis of 58 patients who underwent sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO). Stabilisation of the fragments was achieved with an adjustable monocortical bone fixation system. Lateral cephalograms were taken preoperatively, postoperatively, 6 months postoperatively, and 12 months postoperatively. The radiographs were digitised, and a computerised analysis was performed. The mean mandibular advancement was 8.5 mm with a mean relapse of 0.8 mm after 12 months (P < 0.05). The mean mandibular setback was 7.8 mm with a mean relapse of 1.2 mm after 12 months (P < 0.05). The results of the present study show a minimal relapse after mandibular advancement and setback for the SSRO and the new adjustable fixation system. Postoperative analysis reveals a safe intraoperative positioning of the condyles with subsequent prevention of an immediate relapse. The results after 12 months indicate sufficient long-term stability, although additional evaluations with results after 5 and 10 years are necessary for a final report.
