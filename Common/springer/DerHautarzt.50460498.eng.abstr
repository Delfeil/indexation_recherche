We report on a 34-year-old male patient who developed generalized parakeratosis variegata lesions 4 years after suffering from pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta. For further investigation of a possible interrelationship between these two diseases of the parapsoriasis group and their relationship to the T-cell type of cutaneous non-Hodgkin-lymphoma, histological, immunohistological and molecular-biological techniques were applied. We were able to demonstrate typical morphological features common to both diseases, and a polyclonal T-cell infiltrate in both. It is concluded that pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta and parakeratosis variegata are separate entities without monoclonal rearrangement or signs of malignancy.
