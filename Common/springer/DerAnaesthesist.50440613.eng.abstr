Oesophageal malposition of an endotracheal tube is among the leading causes of anaesthesia incidents. While clinical manoeuvres for detection of tube malposition are unreliable, monitoring (i.e. capnography) can prevent such incidents. The problem is particularly important in prehospital care, where capnography is not (yet) widely available. We tested three devices used for differentiating oesophageal from endotracheal intubation: 1. Non-CO2dependent Oesophageal Detector Device (ODD) as described by Pollard and Wee, 2. Semi-quantitative chemical disposable capnometer EasyCAP (Nellcor), 3. Non-quantitative infrared miniaturised capnometer MiniCAP (MSA).
