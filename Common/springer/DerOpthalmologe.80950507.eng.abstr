The Internet has become a powerful, international source for information, and it has shown an exponential growth because of the ease of access and the immediate availability of information. We introduced a new ophthalmological atlas including ICD coding on the World Wide Web. So far, more than 500 lantern slides of typical and interesting ophthalmological findings have been selected and digitized. These pictures were integrated in a data base, which was arranged for ease and speed of search and retrieval. In its background, the data base contains a list of over 4700 ICD-encoded diagnoses to which the picture-documented findings are linked. Comments on pictures can be added by the author or by users. The data base contains several lists, such as a list of ICD codes and diagnoses, a list of all pictures with corresponding diagnoses, a list of all diagnoses and number of picture, a list of those diagnoses for which the corresponding picture is available, as well as a list of comments on each picture. Special program scripts handle the user's search key words for diagnoses and extract the required information out of the data base, using Windows NT. Search results are presented on an automatically built-up webpage. To provide fast speed of search all pictures initially are shown in a small format (thumbnails) with little amount of data. The related full-size picture is retrieved by a single mouse click. Moreover, the name and institution of the author, diagnostical hints and comments on pictures by the author or by users are offered for each diagnosis available. The Giessen Ophthalmological Picture Atlas can be reached in the Internet. It allows a fast search free of charge from all over the world and, therefore, offers an additional option to obtain specific ophthalmological information for various purposes.
