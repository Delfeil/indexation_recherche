Hereditary multiple exostoses are a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. We report a family in whom the father of the father, the father and all 3 children are affected. In the oldest child, at the age of one year, multiple exostoses at the right elbow and right distal ulna were dis- covered. Due to ongoing growth of these exostoses the relative shortening of the ulna caused a deformity of the elbow including angular deformity and luxation of the radial head and an ulnar deviation of the wrist followed by a functional impairment of the right arm and hand. At the age of 5 an ulnar osteotomy was performed followed by an ulnar lengthening using an external fixateur. Normal forearm function was regained after 8 months of treatment. Six months later the exostoses at the distal right ulna were surgically removed. Two years after the first operation the function of the right forearm and hand were normal, and the boy attended a regular school.
