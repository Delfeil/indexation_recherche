Endourological surgical procedures (transurethral resection and fulguration, Nd-YAG-laser application) for the treatment of interstitial cystitis (IC) have been evaluated only in a few studies. Theoretically, they could be the next step in a therapeutic concept after conservative measures have failed and before open surgery is performed as an ultima ratio.
