 We describe the imaging procedures for the diagnosis of manubriosternal joint arthritis in a 64 years old man with psoriatic arthritis. Involvement of the manubriosternal joint (synchondrosis sternalis) in psoriatic arthritis is a rare manifestation. The findings of bone-scintigraphy, conventional radiography and arthrosonography of the manubriosternal joint arthritis are compared and discussed.
