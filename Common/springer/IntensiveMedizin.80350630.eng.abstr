 In this paper experiences with transtelephonic ECG transmission are reported. After patients have been instructed, they received a simple ECG recorder and transmitted the 9 or 12 lead ECG to the Central Monitoring Unit situated at the intensive care unit (ICU) of the community hospital. This hospital-based transtelephonic ECG surveillance center is served by experienced physicians on a 24 h basis. According to previous studies, this system proved reliable with a high predictive value. This analysis is concerned with patients monitored about one year. Most of the ECG calls were done within the first sixth months. As patients could be immediately advised by a physician of the ICU after sending their ECG and reporting their symptoms, a lot of emergency treatments (emergency car equipped with an emergency physician) could be avoided. Acute ischemic events and arrhythmias could reliably detected, these patients had been referred to their general practitioner or, if necessary, recommended to see the emergency room at the hospital. To date, there are some more projects with telephonic ECG transmission, such as transmission from airplane or from remote tourist places or from the mobile emergency unit. New development will take place in the near future such as transmission of several more biological signals (ECG, oxygen saturation, blood pressure) in combination with the patients medical file via a small card. This then would reduce costs in emergency medicine, if health care providers will acknowledge and accept these procedures.
