The pharmacological profile of ketamine: Until recently, clinically available ketamine was a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of two enantiomers, (S)- and (R)-ketamine. The pharmacological profile of racemic ketamine is characterized by the socalled dissociative anesthesic state and profound sympathomimetic properties. Among the different sites of action, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonism is considered to be the most important neuropharmacological mechanism of ketamine. Effects on opiate receptors, monoaminergic and cholinergic transmitters, and local anesthetic effects are obvious as well. Following intravenous administration, a rapid onset of action is seen within 1 min, lasting for about 10 min. The anaesthetic state is terminated due to redistribution, followed by hepatic and renal elimination with a half-life period of 2-3 h. For alternative administration, the intramuscular and oral route is also appropriate. The most important adverse effects are hallucinations and excessive increases in blood pressure and heart rate. These reactions can be attenuated or avoided by combining of ketamine with sedative or hypnotic drugs like midazolam and/or propofol. During controlled ventilation, increases in intracranial pressure are unlikely to occur.
