Abstract.  Cutis marmorata teleangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is a rare congenital vascular disorder of the venous system. In 50% of cases there are associated anomalies of other organ systems. Clinical improvement of the cutaneous manifestations is noted in most cases and usually occurs during the first year of life. We present a patient with CMTC with a band-like pattern following the L3 dermatome. At the age of 13 years, the skin manifestations worsened, with ulcerations and intermittent claudication. Angiographic imaging revealed stenosis of the deep femoral artery, and the circumflex femoral artery and the first perforating arteries were not visualized. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of CMTC with anomalies of the large arteries.
