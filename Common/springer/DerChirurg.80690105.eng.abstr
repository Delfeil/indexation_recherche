 Zwickau Hospital in Saxony has been a famous center of surgery since the very beginning. It was built by Heinrich Braun, the founder of modern local anesthesia. His successors, Kulenkampff and Mayer, preserved, continued and completed his life's work. The surgery center in Zwickau provided very important ideas for general and local anesthesia, for building and managing hospital and for the science of surgery in words and illustrations.
