 The general aspects for the analysis of malalignment of the low tibial region in the three-dimensional space are discussed. Recommendations for clinical and radiological diagnostics prior to low tibial osteotomies are given. Closing wedge, opening wedge, dome-shaped, distraction, rotational and step-shaped osteotomies as well as combined procedures are described. The possibilities of these techniques are pointed out for malalignment after lower leg, pilon and ankle fractures, as well as after trauma of the distal epiphysis of the tibia. Arthroscopy of the ankle is an additional tool for detailed planning of the adequate surgical procedure. The importance of determining an early correction cannot be underestimated.
