 Resection arthroplasty of the metacarpophangeal joints stabilisized by a Swanson-Silastic-spacer is the golden standard in MP-joint destruction in R.A. 57 (Gr.I), 91 (Gr.II), and 102 (Gr.III) arthroplasties of the metacarpophalangeal joint were assessed in three groups of patients 3.5 years (Gr.I), 4.3 years (Gr.II), and 10.1 years (Gr.III), respectively, postoperatively on the average. In patients of group I titanium protectors, called grommets, were used additionally. Nearly all patients reported a marked relief of pain. Ulnar drift was corrected from an average of 22 ° (Gr.I), 23 ° (Gr.II), and 34 ° (Gr.III) preoperatively to 8 ° (Gr.I), 7 ° (Gr.II), and 12 ° (Gr.III), respectively, postoperatively. Active range of motion remains unchanged with an average of 33 ° (Gr.I), 38 ° (Gr.II), and 42 ° (Gr.III) ROM preoperatively and 42 ° (Gr.I), 37 ° (Gr.II), and 36 ° (Gr.III) ROM, respectively, postoperatively. The average extension deficit had improved from 45 ° (Gr.I), 32 ° (Gr.II), and 33 ° (Gr.III) at surgery to 18 ° (Gr.I), 11 ° (Gr.II), and 11 ° (Gr.III), respectively, at the time of follow-up. Functional improvement of the hand was found in the medium term in 82% and in the longterm in 75% of the patients. The radiographical findings showed surrounding osteolysis in 45.7% (Gr.I), 63.5% (Gr.II), and 89.4% (Gr.III) of the implants and 0% (Gr.I), 16.5% (Gr.II), and 26.9% (Gr.III) broken spacers. From the medium to the longterm run there is an increase in radiographical deterioration. The additional use of titanium grommets in MP-joint arthroplasty seems to reduce reactive osteolysis and protects Swanson Silastic-spacers from breakage without substantial influence on the clinical outcome.
