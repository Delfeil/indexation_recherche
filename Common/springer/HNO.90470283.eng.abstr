Deep injuries to the parotid region may result in trauma to vital structures: i. e., the parotid gland and duct and the facial nerve and its branches. While there is no doubt concerning primary microsurgical reconstruction of injuries to the facial nerve clinical approaches for treating disruptions of  the parotid duct have been controversial. A case report is presented of a secondarily reanastomosed parotid duct following complete transection. The microsurgical technique and its indications are discussed.
