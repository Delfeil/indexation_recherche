 Changes in prostaglandin levels (PG) in pregnancy, during labour and in the puerperium have been frequently investigated, while there are only few studies on oxytocin (OT). This ist not, however, because OT is less important than PG, but because not al laboratories are able to measure OT in plasma. In cooperation with the Institute for Clinical Chemistry at the Medical School in Hannover, we developed a radioimmunoassay with exactly reproducible results. We assayed 110 plasma samples from 60 women, comprising 15 pregnant women with a risk of preterm birth, 18 women during labour, 9 women after delivery, 9 woman during the puerperium and 9 women before, as well as 15-30 min after breast feeding. Medians OT levels were 13.4 pg/ml before, and 13.9 pg/ml after the 32nd week of gestation. Gestational age thus had no influence on plasma OT levels. However, we found a strong correlation to cervical status: women with a prematurely ripened cervix had significantly elevated OT levels. During the advanced first stage of labour (>=6 cm), OT levels were significantly higher than in the early first stage (<=5 cm). However, OT levels were significantly lower in patients with a fast delivery compared to those with a prolonged labour. During the puerperium, OT increased significantly, and levels were constant for the first 3 days of the puerperium. Before and after breast feeding the OT levels remained constant. In conclusion, high levels of OT during pregnancy and labour seemed to indicate an unfavourable prognosis. They were correlated to an increased risk of preterm birth and prolonged duration of labour.
