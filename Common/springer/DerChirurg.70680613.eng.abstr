 A total of 140 patients underwent outpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy in an outpatient clinic. Evaluation and follow-up of the patients were done prospectively. Population and preoperative data were comparable to published studies of patients operated on in hospitals. There were no serious intra- or postoperative complications. Postoperatively, patients needed less pain medication, were less tired and returned to work earlier than patients after clinical laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Outpatient laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers a good alternative to patients with moderate operative risks (ASA 1-3). It could reduce costs in the German health system and would be therefore highly cost effective.
