 Technological advances in spiral CT scanners and their workstations have changed the common perception of computed tomography in vessel imaging. The less invasive character of CTA examination compared to intraarterial DSA can transform this method into the which is viable clinically to increase diagnostic utility. However, the 2D axial images do not optimally communicate the 3D nature of the anatomy and pathology involved. The option to render 3D angiogram-like images can be combined with the diagnostic exploitation of the volume data information. The choice of the rendering technique to create 3D images from the data set greatly affects the quality and efficacy of CTA data. The commonly used rendering techniques are surface shaded display (SSD) and maximum intensity projection (MIP). Volume rendering (VR) as a relatively new modality may have the potential to replace the other rendering techniques. For critical image evaluation it is important to know the basic principles, advantages, disadvantages and limitations of these algorithms.
