 Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. The typical delay from the onset of acute infarction to the development of cardiogenic shock and well defined risk factors allow for an early identification of patients at risk. Immediate restoration of coronary artery patency by thrombolysis or PTCA can prevent cardiogenic shock in a number of these patients. Patients presenting with frank cardiogenic shock should be approached with diagnostic vigor in an attempt to identify a treatable lesion. Several non-randomized studies suggest that PTCA is superior to thrombolysis in patients with shock and ongoing ischemia. However, aortic counterpulsation may enhance reperfusion rates achieved by thrombolytic therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock. Early surgery is required in patients with shock due to mechanical complications, such as acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum. Ventricular assist devices can be used in selected patients with refractory shock as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.
