A differentiated therapeutic regimen for distal radial fractures of the radius requires an exact and reproducible classification system and the same principles for achievement of quality as in other articular fractures. A variety of therapeutic approaches - from simple reduction to arthroscopically assisted operations with autogenous cancellous bone transplantation - exists, which allows for good functional results in most cases. Whereas stable extra-articular fractures can be treated by simple reduction and a cast in most cases, Kirschner wire osteosynthesis should be performed in unstable situations with dorsal comminution. Also, in intra-articular fractures (C1 according to AO) K-wire fixation can be the treatment of choice. Volar comminution and volar shearing fractures require open reduction and internal fixation, sometimes with primary autogenous bone grafting. In all intra-articular fractures with incongruity > 1 mm an open reduction via the dorsal or volar approach has to be considered. C2- and C3-type fractures often require external fixation in addition to K-wire osteosynthesis. External fixation can also be used with good results in cases of secondary displacement. In the future, treatment of distal radial fractures will be influenced by the development of small-dimension titanium implants, as well as by the already existing resorbable and injectable calcium-phosphate ceramic implants.
