A tumor was removed from the right external auditory canal of a 69-year old female patient. The histopathological and immunhistochemical evaluation revealed a pleomorphic adenoma (mixed tumor). The differential diagnosis of the tumors derived from the ceruminal glands, their clinical and prognostic implications as well as the histogenesis of pleomorphic adenomas in this localization are discussed.
