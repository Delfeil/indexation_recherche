This review summarizes some aspects of German pediatrics as it developed after world war II. Having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late forties and fifties and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly industialoized nation. As in other countries, the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social attidudes and expectations, and by economic restrictions. National specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and formalized preventive care program under a public health plan. The need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among subspecialties.
