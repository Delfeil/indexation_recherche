Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior. The efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has been questioned. Opened and controlled investigations have shown risperidone is effective for reducing self-injurious behaviour in mentally retardation. We report about 3 mentally retarded patients which were given open-label riperidone for 12 weeks.They participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the repititive behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule (DAS). All three patients responded.
