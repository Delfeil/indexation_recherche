Tibolone is a synthetic steroid hormone with various tissue-specific estrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic effects. Symptoms of menopause are treated effectively by both tibolone and estrogens and even better by tibolone with respect to mood and libido. Vaginal dryness is relieved due to its estrogenic effect on the vaginal mucosa.
