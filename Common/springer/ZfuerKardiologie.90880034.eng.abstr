  Within the Cologne Model (CM) of outdoor cardiac rehabilitation (OCR), phase II investigations about demand for this form of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after acute cardiac diseases were carried out in three general hospitals, the cardiological and cardiosurgical university hospitals of Cologne. The subsequent questions were investigated: total number of coronary or cardiac operated patients, number of patients with indication for CR, and number of patients corresponding to the restricted indications of CM (age below 65, low risk patient, no cardiac operation). For these groups the acceptance or refusal of CR was checked. Subsequently a sample of patients corresponding to the criteria of CM or of operated patients were confronted with the additional offer of an OCR. The motivation for acceptance of rehabilitation in specialized hospitals (ICR), OCR or refusal of each kind of CR was inquired.
