With a prospective assessment of 140 emergency-room patients, we registered the conventional radiological examinations (CR), ultrasound (US) and computer tomographies (CT), including the duration of the examinations, transportation and diagnostic free time. Results: CR: 98.6 % (average 8.5 radiographs per patient), US 78.6 %, CT 67.8 %. Duration: CR average 20.3 min (range 1-80 min), US average 6.5 min (range 2-15 min), CT average 16.9 min (range 12-135 min). The entire time spent in the primary diagnostic work-up, including CT: average 79.4 min (only CR and US average 49.1 min). Diagnostic free time, including CT: average 31.9 min, without CT average 19.2 min. Time for transportation and repositioning: average 14.5 min. When a CT is indicated, the radiological diagnostic work-up will increase as a result of waiting and transportation. The patient also suffers because of more repositioning procedures.
