Discoid meniscus is one of the commonest anatomical variations of the meniscus. There is at the moment no consensus on the aetiology of discoid meniscus. According to Watanabe three types can be differentiated: the complete form, the incomplete form and the hypermobile Wrisberg form. Discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment. Partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form, while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice, since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible.
