Since 1989, 99 people presenting with posterior knee instability were treated by a unique technique. Of these patients, 55 were available for long-term follow-up (mean 8.2 years); 85% were male, the mean age was 28 years and sport injuries predominated traffic accidents, 52.7% and 40%, respectively. Previous operations could be observed in 29 cases and in 5 patients a high tibial osteotomy and a biceps tenodesis was simultaneously performed with the PCL reconstruction. Clinical evaluation using the IKDC form showed 45 patients scoring in group C and 10 in group D preoperatively. Improvement was achieved in 72.7% of all cases, 63.6% had excellent or good results (3 A, 32 B, 17 C, and 3 D). The Tegner activity score before injury was 7 and was not found to be higher than 5.5 at follow-up. We think that PCL reconstruction with the middle third of the LAD-augmented patella tendon using an anterior and posterior approach is a good technique for surgical therapy of posterior knee instability.
