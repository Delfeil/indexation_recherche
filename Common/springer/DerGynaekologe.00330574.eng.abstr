The incidence of hepatitis A infections has decreased due to improved hygienic conditions in Germany. However, hepatitis A is one of the most important diseases imported to the country. Currently, more than the half of all registered hepatitis A infections are acquired in foreign countries. According to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people (age below 50 years) are not immunized and, subsequently, this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries. Therefore, a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis A (Southern Europe, Africa, South America, and Asia).
