We report on two patients with myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus in whom hypothalamo-pituitary growth hormone deficiency and neurosecretory dysfunction were diagnosed. The patients were treated with human growth hormone (0.5-0.7 IU/ kg/week) since the age of 4.2 and 8.7 years. Short stature, retarded growth velocity, retarded bone age, reduced arm span and low IGF1 and IGFBP-3 serum levels were found. During growth hormone therapy (duration: 24-33 months) patients improved in growth velocity, supine length and arm span. In one girl with thoraco-lumbar scoliosis a rapid progression of the deformity developed. Tethered cord and syringomyelia were present.
