A 36-year-old man known as chronic alcohol abuser presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral petriefied kidneys by sonography and computed tomography. Because of an unclear renal failure a kidney biopsy was performed and presented typical chronic renal oxalosis with massive oxalate crystal deposits, tubular atrophy and interstitital fibrosis. Since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before, a secondary oxalosis was supposed. The subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of rocket fuel with cola lemonade 12 years before during the patient's army time as a marine soldier. Such fuels contain ethylene glycol (glysantin) as antifreeze commonly known to cause in toxic doses acute renal tubular necrosis with hyperoxaluria. The presented case, however, suggests a rare sublethal ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage, oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure. Undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the patient died 5 months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure. At autopsy, progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed. Decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension.
