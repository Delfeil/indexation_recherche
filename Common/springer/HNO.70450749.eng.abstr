Hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages: (1) stigmatization of the patient; (2) the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion; (3) in many patients, the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect; (4) acoustic feedback when amplification is high. Conventional hearing aids transmit sound into the ear canal via a small microphone. Sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission. This along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned. In contrast, implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations. An implantable hearing aid has an electromechanical transducer instead of the loudspeaker of a conventional hearing aid. The hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system bypassing the air. This implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane, the ossicular chain, the perilymph of the inner ear, or the skull.
