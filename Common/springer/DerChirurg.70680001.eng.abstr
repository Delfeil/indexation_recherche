 Epidemiological data reveal a decline in the incidence of appendicitis and appendectomy in the industrialized countries. A peak is found in adolescents aged 10-19 years; however, the highest rates of perforation are reported for the extremely young and old age groups. The elevated rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation, especially in young women, and the high perforation ratio in small children and elderly patients reflect poor diagnostic accuracy. Analysis of the epidemiological data does not allow for an unequivocal conclusion regarding the etiopathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
