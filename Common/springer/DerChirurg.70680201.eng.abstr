 The so-called extended diagnostic laparoscopy (EDL) facilitates the comprehensive exploration of the abdominal cavity, thus improving the precision of the pretherapeutic tumor staging in gastrointestinal malignancies. EDL comprises visual inspection with a specific preparation of all relevant sites, laparoscopic sonography and retrieval of samples for biopsy and cytology. Additional relevant therapeutic information was obtained through EDL in 40.5 % of gastric cancer patients. EDL could be of similar importance for diagnosing esophageal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancies.
