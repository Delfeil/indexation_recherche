 In patients receiving surgical interventions with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, the incidence of postoperative neurological and neuropsychological dysfunction still remains high. The reasons for these disorders may be seen as multifactorial and can be divided into patient and cardiopulmonary bypass related risk factors. In this review non-invasive (transcranial Doppler sonography, electroencephalography, infrared spectroscopy) and invasive (measurement of jugular venous oxygen saturation, Kety-Schmidt technique, 133Xenon-clearance technique, transcerebral double indicator dilution technique) monitoring methods were evaluated for clinical applicability and evidence to detect cerebral hemodynamic and metabolic impairment during and after the cardiopulmonary bypass period.
