We investigated in 17 children (mean 7.1 years) the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation cystoplasty or exstrophy reconstruction. Mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3.8  +/-  1.1 days (initial dosage 0.25 mg/kg/per hour, dose adjustment by the nursing staff). Mean tramadol consumption was 0.21 mg/kg/h on day 1 and was reduced to 0.08 mg/kg/per hour on day 4. Median pain score (assessed with ten-step scales) was 5 before treatment and between 2.5 (day 1) and 0.5 (day 5) during therapy. Lowest oxygen saturations (mean) ranged from 93.8 % to 95.2 %. Three patients (17.6 %) suffered from nausea/vomiting on 3 of 64 treatment days (4.7 %). Pruritus and extreme sedation did not occur. The continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children.
