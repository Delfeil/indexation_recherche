  A 38 year old male patient with a coarctation of the aorta was successfully operated using an ascending aorta-abdominal aorta bypass (AAAAB). The diagnosis of a severe postisthmic stenosis had been confirmed by aortography. Preoperatively the patient suffered from extreme hypertension and claudicatio intermittens. After prosthetic repair of coarctation, blood pressure became normotensive and claudicatio intermittens disappeared. In this report, we discuss various surgical techniques and the most important question concerning the optimal timing of surgical repair of aortic coarctation.
