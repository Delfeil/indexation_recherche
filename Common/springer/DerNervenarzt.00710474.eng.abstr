Of 1310 patients surgically treated for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), 134 (10.2%) were observed to have one or more trigger fingers or de Quervain's disease. Of a total of 205 fingers, the middle finger was affected 75 times, the ring finger 50 times, the thumb 47 times, the small finger 17 times, and the index finger 16 times. Chronic nonspecific synovitis is commonly suspected as the cause of both diseases. In all cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, the patient should therefore be examined for symptoms of concomitant trigger finger and vice versa. Both can be cured surgically under local anesthesia and bloodless field in a single session.
