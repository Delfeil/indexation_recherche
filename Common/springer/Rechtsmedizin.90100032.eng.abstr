 The forensically relevant aspects of mummification were investigated in six fatalities from the years 1996-1998. The deceased (6 males between 22 and 77 years) had lived socially isolated. The postmortem interval was between 8 months and 5 years. On external examination the bodies showed - mostly combined - putrefaction, postmortem insect artifacts and different stages of decomposition, especially mummification (so-called secondary mummification). The differentiation of certain organs by inspection with the naked eye was a problem to some extent. Histopathological examinations presented relevant findings for further elucidation of the cause of death. Immunhistochemical staining with myeloperoxidase revealed confluent bronchopneumonia in one case of 19 months postmortem interval. In a case of known chronic heroin consumption morphine was detected after a postmortem interval of 31 months. Apart from forensic pathology and toxicology aspects and criminal investigations, these fatalities are also noteworthy from the point of view of social medicine.
