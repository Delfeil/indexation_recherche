Object of this review is to present the physiological principles, diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis. Despite intense research activities in this area, many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear. For example, the often discussed shift of the critical value of oxygen delivery to higher values in sepsis has not been proven, yet. Beside an impaired regional perfusion also disturbances in the cellular oxygen utilization may be responsible for organ failure in sepsis. Until now, it was not shown, whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients. It is also unknown, which catecholamine and which infusion solution is suitable for the treatment of septic patients. In future further research is necessary to solve the problems associated with sepsis therapy.
