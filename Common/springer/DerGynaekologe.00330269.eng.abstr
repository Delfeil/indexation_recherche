Urodynamic and morphologic follow-up studies have improved the understanding of the action of different surgical procedures for the treatment of urinary incontinence. Objective measurements and subjective estimations of improvement of quality of life have demonstrated the superiority of colposuspension and sling procedures, whereas vaginal repairs and needle suspensions can no longer be recommended as basic procedures. While tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) can be regarded as a real innovation, the different modifications of needle suspensions with ready-to-use sets of bone anchors and screws disregard the disadvantages of fixation in the paraurethral area. There seems to be a strict indication for peri- and intraurethral injections in selected patients with multiple failures and hypotonic or atonic urethra, but not as a primary procedure. Surgical traditions and problems of reimbursement are major reasons for paramedical decision making.
