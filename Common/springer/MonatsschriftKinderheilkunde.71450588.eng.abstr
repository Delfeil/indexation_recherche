The subject of this report is a newborn female, suffering from hypotonia and breathing difficulties, delivered in the 37 week with the help of forceps. Because of the nature of her symptons and those of the mother, which included Facies myopathica and Myotonia, the possibility of the expansion of a CTG-Trinukleotidsequence in the area of Chromosom 19 was explored. For this purpose a technique, developed in 1992, for the identification of molecular genetic characteristics was used. Instead of the 5 to 27 copies of the CTG sequence normally found in the population, the sick child had 1000 and the mother more than 700. EMG, in which a classical relases of myotones (Fall-Fight-Bomberscream) were found, confirmed the neurological diagnosis. Discussion: In the course of time the newborn child showed the classical problems of hyptotonia, such as respiratory difficulties, eating disorders leading to a loss of weight, meteroism, and after another stay in hospital, symptoms of Ileus.
