The case of a five-year-old girl with intractable fluor vaginalis and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported. A presacral dermoid cyst was shown to be the cause of these symptoms. Extensive radiological investigation revealed the cyst and the associated fistulas extending into the perianal region and the vagina. After verification of the anatomical situation, an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out.
