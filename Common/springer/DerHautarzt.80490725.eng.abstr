Although the association between administration of the antitumor agent bleomycin and the development of cutanous fibrosis is established, there are only a small number of cases of bleomycin-induced scleroderma described in the literature. We report the development of generalised scleroderma with wide spread hyperpigmentation in a 52-year-old male patient, who received a total dose of 360 mg bleomycin in combination with cisplatin and etoposid for therapy of a malignant testicular seminoma. The clinical cutaneous alterations as well as the histological findings were indistinguishable from those encountered in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS). In contrast to PSS however, Raynaud's phenomenon, cutaneous calcinosis, teleangiectasia, arthritis and involvement of additional organs were all absent. PSS-typical auto-antibodies were negative. Even 18 months after discontinuation of the drug and treatment with UVA1 phototherapy (3-4 times per week with 20 J/cm2) as well as physiotherapy, the skin changes had still not resolved. Based on our case and a detailed review of the literature, we discuss characteristics of bleomycin-induced scleroderma including pathogenesis, treatment modalities and course.
