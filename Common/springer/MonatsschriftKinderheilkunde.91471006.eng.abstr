We describe a patient who was admitted to hospital because of hypoglycemic convulsions at the age of 6 months. Diagnostics revealed that the hypoglycemic episodes were caused by glycogen synthase deficiency. Glycogen synthase deficiency its a rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia in childhood associated with normal production of ketone bodies. It is characterized by supranormal increase of glucose and lactate in blood after a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a reduced activity of glycogen synthase in liver tissue, and lately also by identification of pathogenic mutations in the glycogensynthase gene (GYS2-gene). Hypoglycemic episodes can be prevented by offering frequent protein-rich meals during the day and a late evening meal with uncooked corn starch.
