The early development of the brachial plexus shows that it is formed of a dorsal branch supplying the extensor muscles and a ventral branch for the flexor muscles. Although the network becomes more and more complex, a basic pattern is generally preserved. This basic pattern, as well as variants and the topography of the lateral neck triangle, is described.
