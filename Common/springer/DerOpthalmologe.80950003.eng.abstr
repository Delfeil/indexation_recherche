Recent studies have sought to quantify aqueous flare by laser flare measurement. An increase in aqueous flare caused by a rise of protein concentration was frequently found both in anterior and posterior segment disease. This has been interpreted as a breakdown of the blood - aqueous barrier (BAB). By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BAB compared to the aqueous flare value in patients with anterior and posterior uveitis, the extent to which the increase in flare value was related to a possible break down of the BAB was examined.
