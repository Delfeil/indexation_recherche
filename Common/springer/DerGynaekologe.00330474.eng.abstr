Early cancer detection is one of the major tasks in the daily work of the gynecologist. In 1971, the directory for a public early cancer detection program was defined. Organ systems examined include the external and internal genitalia, the breasts, the skin, the rectum, and the colon. Methods applied include detailed anamneses, body exam, training for breast self-examination, Pap smear, and stool testing for blood. The use of mammography is restricted to women from families with multiple breast cancer cases or with previous breast alterations.
