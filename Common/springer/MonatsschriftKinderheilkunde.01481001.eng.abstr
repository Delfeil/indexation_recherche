Background. Tyrosinemia type I is an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase resulting in accumulation of tyrosin and its degradation products (succinylacetoacetone mainly). Typical clinical features include liver and kidney failure as well as central nervous system involvement. There are three main forms of the disease: the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age.
