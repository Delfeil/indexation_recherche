 Children are exposed to a greater risk than adults for severe late postsplenectomy infection. Therefore, prophylaxis against bacterial infections need to be more extensive. This paper presents a protocol for preventive measures in children. Repeated education of the patient and his/her parents about the consequences of splenic loss is mandatory. Vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae are highly recommended and also against Neisseria meningitidis in certain situations. The importance of long-term antibiotic prophylaxis in children is emphasized. Recent advances in vaccine development and the increasing problems with antibiotic resistance are discussed.
