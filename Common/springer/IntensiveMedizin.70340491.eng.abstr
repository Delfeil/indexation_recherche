 Quality control concepts will provide a basis for inter-Unit comparisons. A classification in: appraisal of structure, assessment of process and assessment of outcomes provides a systematical approach to quality assurance and control. Patient data management sytsems including Score systems can be useful to evaluate diagnostic, therapeutic and scientific standards. Quality is matched with the already mentioned cost effectiveness. The use of computerized systems allows to determine the costs for a patient. But it is important to consider some principles of economic analysis. An explicit statement of the perspective of the analysis should be provided and an explicit description of the benefits of the programme or technology being studied.
