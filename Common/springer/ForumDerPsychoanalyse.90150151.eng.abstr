In the 1930s hundreds of psychoanalysts emigrated from Central Europe, among them the most important representatives of the new movement. This exodus had a lasting effect on the history of psychoanalysis. We pursue its consequences in the context of two different subjects: The first one describes the influence of the Viennese emigrés on the development and the spread of psychoanalysis in the U.S.A. The Americanization of psychoanalysis led to great successes in the fields of psychoanalytical training, the development of theory, of psychiatry, science and everyday culture, but produced also problematic alterations. In the second part we remember the traumatic experiences of so many and so important psychoanalysts. Psychoanalysis itself could profit from coping with these experiences, but was at the same time damaged by them. Beside increased creativity and productivity the experiences of loss contributed also to stagnation and rigid developments.
