 Objectives: Two third of patients with acute myocardial infarction are admitted to hospitals without cardiac catheterization facilities. Whether a postinfarction patient will undergo cardiac catheterization or not is more often decided by general physicians than by cardiologists. The purpose of this presentation is to investigate the determinants for decision making to use cardiac catheterization in patients after myocardial infarction.
