 Based on recent reviews on the management of patients with status asthmaticus, the authors present their interpretation of the literature and clinical experience. Medical treatment with -agonists, steroids, aminophyllin and other bronchodilators (ketamine, anesthetic gases) and intensive care procedures (fluid management, heliox, bronchial lavage) are reviewed mechanical measures as mechanical hypoventilation, non-invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary bypass are discussed. Accepting status astmaticus as a life-threatening situation and acting in medical responsibility in the outlined way will provide successful management of patients with status asthmaticus.
