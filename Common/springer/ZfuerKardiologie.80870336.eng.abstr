  Recent randomized clinical trials reported a reduction of restenosis using intracoronary stents and suggested that this restenosis reduction is a result of the higher immediate luminal gain in comparison to conventional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The hypothesis of this sutdy is based on the assumption that IVUS guided PTCA leads to equivalent long term PTCA results as compared to PTCA and the additional placement of a stent. Thus, the purpose of this non-randomized single center study was to evaluate (1) the safety and efficacy and (2) the long term outcome of vessel size adapted PTCA in patients with native coronary lesions.
