Most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with Borrelia Burgdorferi. Erythema migrans is a classical skin lesion of early borreliosis characterized by a centrifugally expanding erythema at the site of the prior tick bite. After hematological spreading of the vector multiple erythemata migrantia occur with a very low incidence in Europe as described in the case of a 2 1/2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine. One year follow-up revealed no further manifestations of borreliosis. This means an excellent prognosis for those children with borreliosis who are treated promptly.
