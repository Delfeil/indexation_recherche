Intention: CT angiography of intracranial vascular lesions requires a constant and high intra-arterial concentration of the contrast medium over the period of data acquisition. The volume of the injected contrast medium can be minimized by exact timing of the bolus injection. Non-predictable interindividual variance of veno-arterial circulation time, e. g., in patients with impaired cerebral hemodynamics after subarachnoidal hemorrhage, requires determination of the appropriate prescan delay.
