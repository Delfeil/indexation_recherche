100 ASA I and II children, aged 4 to 14 years, and scheduled for strabismus surgery, were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: group 1 (n=50): endotracheal tube, group 2 (n=50): laryngeal mask airway. Apart from airway management, the anaesthesiological procedures were identical in both groups: induction with 2-3 mg/kg propofol, 0.02 mg/kg alfentanil, 0.05 mg/kg vecuronium, and 0.01 mg/kg atropine. After endotracheal intubation or insertion of the laryngeal mask, anaesthesia was continued with 6-15 mg/kg - h propofol and 10-30 µg/kg - h alfentanil. All patients were ventilated with N2O/O2 (2:1). No antiemetics were given, gastric contents were not aspirated. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were recorded by 24 h, the incidence of sore throats was recorded 8, 12, and 24 h post-operatively.
