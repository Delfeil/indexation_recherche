Craniomandibular disorders are suggested to be responsible for many cases of chronic pain of the head and face. The assessment of dysfunctional factors in diseases of chronic head and facial pain normally requires special knowledge and equipment for the diagnosis and therapy of stomatognathic dysfunction. However, the first signs can be evaluated rather well without using complete equipment, which is not always avaible in general practice. It is therefore important that general practitioners have a simple, time-efficient method of routine screening based on sufficient methods and tests. Thus, we would like to present a questionnaire consisting of ten points that cover the valid elements of complete stomatognathic assessment. Answering these questions reveals signs of dysfunctional components of craniomandibular disorders, which indicate a dysfunction diagnosis and even better, consultation with a specialist.
