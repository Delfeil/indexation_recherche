The torn acetabular labrum is a classical indication for hip arthroscopy. Clinical and imaging diagnosis are not so reliable compared to hip arthroscopy, which also allows therapeutic intervention. Advances in the technique of arthroscopic examination of the hip joint enable an accurate diagnosis of a torn acetabular labrum as well as arthroscopic resection of such pathology. During 267 consecutive hip arthroscopies, 37 labral lesions (13,9 %) could be identified and were resected successfully. The morphological classification of labral tears, and their frequency was allocated to radial flap tears (57 %), fibrillated radial tears (22 %), longitudinal peripheral tears (16 %) and unstable labra (5 %). One year after surgery, 78 % of the patients were improved, whereas 5 were not improved and 3 had worsened. Larger series with longer follow-up should be reported enabling scientific assessment of the procedure. At this early stage, however, we would recommend that all patients with a suspected labral tear should undergo hip arthroscopy.
