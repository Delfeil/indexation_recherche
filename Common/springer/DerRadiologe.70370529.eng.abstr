Through the introduction of newly invented high-performance gradient systems to MRI, which enable for echoplanar imaging (EPI), also magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has gained an entirely new field of applications and techniques. Ultrafast imaging techniques in MRA allow the investigation of larger vascular areas within a single breathhold-period. Artifacts like motion induced signal misregistrations, dephasing or saturation of the vascular signal are minimized by extremely short echo times.
