The development of cancer is one of the most intensively studied areas of medical research resulting in an immense quantity of data. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to give an overview of the basic principles of cancer development. Key words such as multi-step carcinogenesis, cell cycle, proto-oncogene, tumor suppressor gene, DNA repair gene, apoptosis and telomeres are explained and described in examples. This paper aims to connect recent information of molecular and cellular biology in an overview of cancer origin and development.
