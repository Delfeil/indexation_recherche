Induced hypotension is an accepted technique to reduce intraoperative blood loss and thereby ensures satisfactory operating conditions, especially in microscopic interventions. Sodium nitroprusside (NP), which is often used for induced hypotension, was reported to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro. Impairment of platelet function implies a higher bleeding risk, which would make the use of NP for induced hypotension questionable.
