We report on a 59-year-old woman patient with selective IgA deficiency and familial hypercholesterinaemia. To lower elevated LDL levels in the patient's blood, immunoadsorption therapy with sheep-anti-human polyclonal antibodies coupled to sepharose columns was administered. During the procedure, the patient developed an anaphylactic shock requiring intensive care treatment. The patient's history revealed a fresh cell therapy with fetal sheep cells 10 years previously. Intracutaneous testing confirmed sensitization to sheep immunoglobulin, which was the most likely reason for the anaphylactic shock.
