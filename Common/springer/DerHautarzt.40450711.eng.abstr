Abstract.  Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare syndrome of unknown origin consisting of recurrent fever, urticarial rash, arthralgias or arthritides, lymphadenopathia, splenomegalia and nonspecific sore throat. It is always linked with leucocytosis and negative blood cultures; rheumatic and antinuclear factors are mostly negative. Very high ferritin levels are frequent and could be a marker of the disease. We report on two cases and give a review of the literature.
