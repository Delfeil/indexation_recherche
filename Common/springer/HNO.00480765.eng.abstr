Airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise. This very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 dB sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries. We report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation. The 24-year-old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000- to 6000-Hz range and in the deep-frequency. The possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic.
