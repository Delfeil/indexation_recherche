There has been an increase in the use of fetal ultrasound in the first trimester over the last few years. This paper reviews the published literature on first trimester fetal nuchal translucency. Increased nuchal translucency (NT) may identify more than 80 % of chromosomal anomalies for a false-positive rate of about 5 %. Another potential of early NT measurement lies in the detection of other fetal anomalies like structural defects, genetic disorders, or early fetal hydrops and may present an early sign of twin-twin transfusion syndrome in monochorionic pregnancies. The association of fetal NT and main fetal disorders is reviewed. The clinical prenatal management options for parents regarding the early detection of high-risk groups and the detection of fetal anomalies are discussed.
