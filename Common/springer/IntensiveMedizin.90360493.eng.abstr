 Procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin. It is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection. In contrast, procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non-infectious systemic inflammatory states. Because of these properties, procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis. Increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity. Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland. The origin of the high levels of procalcitonin in septic conditions is not fully understood. Although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections, a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis. More studies are needed to uncover the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule.
