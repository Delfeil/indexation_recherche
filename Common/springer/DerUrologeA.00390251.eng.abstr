We report about a patient wich acute scrotal pain. Power Doppler sonography demonstrated arterial testicular perfusion. As no amelioration was achieved by conservative treatment, surgical exploration was done after 7 days. Intraoperatively, we found a partial testicular torsion with a 180 ° rotation of the testis at the rete testis. This case demonstrates, that the detection of intratesticular arterial blood flow cannot exclude testicular torsion.
