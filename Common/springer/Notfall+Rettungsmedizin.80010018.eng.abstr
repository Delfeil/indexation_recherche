The management of catastrophes with a high number of seriously injured  people requires a point of first medical treatment at the site of damage. The Fire Brigade and Rescue Paramedic Team at Zurich-Kloten Airport in Switzerland is therefore developing two mobile containers as medical workplaces in case of a disaster at the airport or in the surrounding area. The idea is to have in each of these mobile containers two medical workplaces to manage all of the required operations. The restriction of space and the time-critical work processes in case of a catastrophe or emergency require an  ergonomic workplace design to guarantee optimal work procedures maintaining efficiency and patient safety.
