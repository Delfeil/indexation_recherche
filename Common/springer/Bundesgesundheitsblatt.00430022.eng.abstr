Since January 1999 - the final phase of polio eradication - international teams of epidemiologists support AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance and national immunization campaigns in countries where polio is still endemic. With this support it was possible both in Burkina Faso/West Africa and in Chad/Central Africa to establish sensitive AFP surveillance and to reach high OPV (oral polio vaccine) immunization coverage.
