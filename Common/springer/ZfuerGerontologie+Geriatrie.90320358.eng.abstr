 The further development of 162 stroke patients (average age 77 years), who were geriatrically assessed during hospitalization, was evaluated ca. 18 months after stroke. Questionnaires were mailed to patients. 53% of the patients (n = 86) returned the questionnaire duly filled in; 20% (n = 32) had died; in the remaining 27% of cases (n = 44) no information was obtained on further development. 80% of those patients who responded lived at home despite numerous medical problems. Family members assumed most of the care required. Follow-up treatment and pain therapy proved to be particularly problematic. The Barthel Index according to data collected was significantly lower compared to figures noted upon release from the hospital. Hardly anyone among those patients received follow-up treatment. 74% of patients complained of pain although the majority has regular contacts with the family doctor. For those patients who died in the 18 months interval, significantly lower values for the activities of daily living (ADL) has already been recorded upon hospitalization. They had a less favorable view of their state of health and were less satisfied with life in general.
