 Purpose: Since its introduction in the 1980s, intraoperative thrombolysis in peripheral arterial occlusion as an additional procedure has been shown to be attractive and effective in reducing limb loss in severe lower-limb ischemia. Although the results are promising additional intraoperative intra-arterial thrombolysis has not been widely used according to the few papers published with approximately 300 patients that have been published from 1985 until now. Are vascular surgeons not acquainted with the intraoperative use of streptokinase, urokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA)? We report our own experience, comparing our results with the data available in the literature. Patients and methods: Thirty patients (16 men, 14 women, mean age 71 years) with severe limb-threatening ischemia were treated with operative thromboembolectomy, local thrombendarterectomy or bypass-grafting and, simultaneously, with additional intraoperative thrombolysis. After clot removal or a revascularization procedure and after documentation by angiography, the procedure was accomplished by intra-arterial instillation of rt-PA (mean dose 10.5 mg Actilyse). Perioperatively, patients received systemic anticoagulation with heparin. Results: All but two combined revascularizations resulted in clinical and angiographically documentated restoration of perfusion to the affected limb. Four (13%) major amputations and two (7%) repeat operations due to bleeding complications were necessary during the 30-day postoperative period. Three (10%) patients died postoperatively, but not due to bleeding or operative complications. Conclusion: Intraoperative intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA is an attractive adjunct to catheter thromboembolectomy or to a revascularization procedure in limbthreatening ischemia. Salvage of the limb seems to be increased. We conclude that thrombolysis is effective and safe.
