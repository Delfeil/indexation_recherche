 Today echocardiography is the noninvasive method of choice for routinely and urgently performed cardiologic diagnostics. Echo enhancing agents are suited to lessen the restrictions of tm, Doppler, and color Doppler echocardiography by physics and to better visualize the problems resolving. In the meantime, there are different echo enhancing agents available for contrast echocardiography of right and left heart chambers. The article describes the application of contrast echocardiography striking the cardiologist in emergency and intensive care medicine. In pericardial tamponade or difficult pericardiocentesis, contrast echocardiography allows one to better distinguish between free epicardial and surrounded pericardial site of right atrium and ventricle. The use of native and color Doppler contrast echocardiography has increased the sensitivity and specifity in diagnosing an atrial septal defect or a patent foramen ovale. Today it is the standard technique for this indication. Contrast enhancers significantly improve the noninvasive echocardiographic assessment of normal and pathologic intracardiac flow and are capable of accurately determining intracardiac velocities and pressure gradients. Contrast transthoracic echocardiography is currently used to identify intrapulmonary shunts in patients with end-stage liver disease and expected hepatopulmonary syndrome. After myocardial infarction with imminent rupture or surgical left ventricular reduction contrast echocardiography may help to better appreciate the stability of the myocardium. The number of diagnostically utilizable Doppler signals can be significantly increased by using left ventricular contrast medium in diagnosis of aortic valve stenosis by means of Doppler echocardiography.
