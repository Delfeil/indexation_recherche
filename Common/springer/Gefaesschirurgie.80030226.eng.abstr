 The stage-oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice. Nowadays, partial stem varicosis, which is an earlier stage of the disease, leads to operative treatment more frequently than 10 years ago; thus a sufficient vein stump remains after surgical treatment. After surgery on a group of 1000 patients, we examined the stumps for patency, the occurrence of varicose changes, for their availability in the long term, and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery. The treatment of insufficient perforant veins was also included in the surgical therapy, as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins. With a follow-up period of up to 33 months postoperatively, the results show a high patency rate in the remaining stumps (97%), as well as a high sufficiency rate (94%), with a mean graft length of 29.4 cm. Thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions. This study supports the call for the stage-oriented surgical treatment of stem varicosis.
