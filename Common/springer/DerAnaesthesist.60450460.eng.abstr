Postoperatively, after an uncomplicated vaginal hysterectomy, a 58-year-old female patient developed the signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation and fever, which progressed to a septic shock. She received two units of autologous blood, one during and one after the operation. A blood culture from the patient and one unit of the autologous blood showed abundant growth of Pseudomonas cepacia and Serratia marcescens within 24 h and culture of this blood bag also showed slight growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis within 48 h. Culture of the second blood unit showed slight growth of Propionibacterium acnes. The source of bacterial contamination could not be identified. Autologous blood products thus also include a risk of infection that shouldn't be underestimated, and a strict medical indication to retransfusion is indispensable.
