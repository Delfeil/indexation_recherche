Background: In contrast to the correction of simple myopia there is no widely accepted technique for the correction of myopic astigmatism. Currently two techniques are available: the photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) and the combination of arcuate keratotomies with standard PRK (PRK-T).
