A problem arose when the reamed tibia nail was replaced by a massive unreamed tibia nail. Of the nail fractures, it is difficult to remove the distal fragment from the medullary cavity. It may also happen that the connecting screw between the insertion handle and the nail breaks off at the edge of the implant, which complicates removal of the nail. The authors have developed a technique for removing the implant without having to saw a fissure in the marrow. A concave instrument is slid over the part of the nail left behind after which the two are connected by means of a K wire. This method has been successfully applied in two patients.
