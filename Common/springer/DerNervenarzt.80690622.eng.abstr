In our study on Psychiatry, Mass Media and Public Opinion we made a content analysis of newspaper reports on ECT and electric defibrillation. We traced only few special articles on the subject in the 1994 and 1995 CD.Rom versions of the "Der Spiegel", The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" (FAZ), the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" (NZZ) and the "Berliner Tageszeitung" (taz), although the word "Elektroschock" was employed 118 times. Even in high standard newspapers the style of language becomes special when they deal with ECT. The articles are strongly biased and lack informations. In contrast to Defibrillation ECT is not generally accepted. Referring to ECT horror pictures of past psychiatry are cited. The language used is biased and discriminative. Referring to Defibrillation technical details are described and the language is neutral. The social representation of ECT is completely negative.
