 Urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40% of all nosocomial infections. In most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters. The guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, as the most important evidence-based guideline worldwide, was published in 1981 and has not been updated so far. Evidence-based national guidelines are not available in Germany. We have, therefore, performed a literature search for randomized, controlled studies on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (Medline, Cochrane Library, reference text books) published since 1981. Fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. Substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials. Based upon the CDC guideline, whose principles are still valid, updated guidelines for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been developed by the National Reference Center for Hospital Hygiene.
