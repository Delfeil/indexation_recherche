Severe hyperhidrosis may present as a vexing condition for the patient and a therapeutic challenge for the physician. As botulinum toxin-A (BT-A) can potently block cholinergic sympathic innervation of sweat glands it was used in an open trial for controlling severe axillary hyperhidrosis. After visualization of hyperhidrosis using the iodine-starch-test BT-A (Dysport, 400 Units) was injected intradermally in one axilla. One week later gravimetric quantification of sweat secretion revealed a reduction of sweating to 4-9% of initial values. In order to rule out daily variations as well as other factors interfering with sweat production BT-A treatment was restricted to only one axilla in each individual clearly demonstrating extensive anhidrotic efficacy on the treated side only. The treatment was well tolerated without side-effects and was assessed as 'completely satisfying' by all patients. BT-A may offer a fast, safe and highly effective therapeutic option for severe hyperhi-drosis.
