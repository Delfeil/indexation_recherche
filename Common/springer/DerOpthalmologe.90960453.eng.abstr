Introduction: The correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of photoablation (PRK), while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy. Experience has shown that cataract surgery, using modern tunnel techniques with self-healing incisions, results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing. In this study, we attempted to combine the advantages of lamellar keratotomy with those of a pair-wise T-incision as arcuate lamellar keratotomy (ALK).
