  Reports from several countries indicate that women are disadvantaged in the treatment of coronary heart disease. The aim of the present review is to examine - on the basis of current population-based data (National Health Survey [NHS], hospital diagnosis registry, mortality rates ) - whether in the Federal Republic of Germany more recently a change in favor of women could be established. According to NHS results prevalence rates of hypertension, overweight, and smoking in men exceed those of women, whereas hypercholesterolaemia is equally prevalent in both sexes. From 1984/85 to 1990/91 the NHS revealed a marked decline of smoking in men, and a parallel increase in women. The prevalence of chest pain shows no gender difference, but chest pain in men is more predictive for coronary artery disease. In acute myocardial infarction [AMI] thrombolysis and PTCA are applied with equal frequency; the average length of stay in hospital is greater for women. Coronary bypass surgery and rehabilitation in hospitals are less frequently applied in women. Little is known about gender differences in psychosocial adaptation after AMI. AMI mortality rates in all age groups are lower in women, and their mean age of death is higher. However, the decline of AMI mortality since 1980 was less pronounced in women compared to men.
