 There is no doubt about the superiority of autologous vein bypasses over artificial grafts for below-knee reconstructions. With respect to above-knee bypasses this advantage of the autologous vein bypass has yet to be proven. In order to clarify this, we performed a prospective randomized multicenter study in which 63 patients received PTFE grafts and 54 patients received autologous vein bypasses. No statistically significant differences, according to the primary and secondary patency rates, could be observed 1 and 3 years postoperatively. Considering these figures, we recommend PTFE as the material of choice for above-knee reconstructions, so that the great saphenous vein is preserved for potential below-knee reconstructions or for an aortocoronary bypass.
