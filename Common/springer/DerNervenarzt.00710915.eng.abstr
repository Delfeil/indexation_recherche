Psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years, but for severely ill patients, often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care, the situation remains unsatisfactory. Community-based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care. The quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined, and many patients end up in asylums or homeless shelters unable to provide for their psychiatric needs. Neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet.
