 Intestinal, renal, spinal or peripheral arterial ischemia or failure of branch artery recanalization following initial prosthetic repair of thoracoabdominal aortic dissection is still a problem, with high morbidity and mortality. Five consecutive patients with acute thoracoabdominal aortic dissection (two type A dissections, three type B dissections) suffering from concomitant intestinal, renal, spinal and acute peripheral arterial ischemia are reported. Considering the anatomical and pathophysiological basis of thoracoabdominal aortic dissection and concomitant organ ischemia, the aortic fenestration procedure as a primary or secondary operative approach succeeded in restoring blood flow in all cases without complications. Assessment of the long-term results after 3 years revealed that all patients are doing well without any residual complaints. We conclude that in the case of persistent or secondary onset of aortic branch artery ischemia following initial prosthetic repair of either type A or type B dissection, aortic fenestration can be recommended immediately as a staged operative approach. Primary abdominal aortic fenestration is justified in acute type B dissection when end-organ ischemia becomes the focus of clinical deterioration.
