 Introduction: The APACHE II score is a well-known measure of illness severity and is widely used for patient classification and outcome prediction in critically ill patients. Since 1993, the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in Cologne-Merheim uses the APACHE II score for assessment of quality of care by comparing actual versus predicted mortality. The subgroup of trauma patients was identified as showing higher mortality rates than expected from scoring. A comparison with trauma-specific score systems can prove the appropriateness of the APACHE II score in trauma patients. Methods: All trauma patients in the surgical intensive care unit within an 18 months period were identified. All patients had a routine prospective APACHE II assessment. Hospital records and pre-hospital emergency physician protocols for all trauma patients were reviewed and trauma-specific prognostic scores (ISS, RTS, TRISS) were calculated. Subgroup analyses (head injury; severity of trauma; age) were performed. Results: Among 938 patients treated in the surgical ICU, 91 trauma patients were identified; 11 of them died (12.1%). The mean APACHE II score at ICU entry for this group was 10.0, which corresponds to an estimated 7.1% risk of death (RODAPACHE). The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) is, thus, 1.70. Trauma-specific scoring systems reveal higher risk of death estimates: mean ISS = 26.3 (RODISS = 20%), mean RTS = 6.38 (RODRTS = 6 - 13%), and mean TRISS = 0.78 (RODTRISS = 22%). Subgroup analysis shows under-estimation of ROD by APACHE II in elderly patients and patients with head injuries. Conclusion: The results of APACHE II score assessment in the group of trauma patients should be interpreted carefully since the actual risk of death is under-estimated. A parallel assessment of trauma-specific scoring systems like TRISS should always accompany risk of death estimates in these type of patients.
