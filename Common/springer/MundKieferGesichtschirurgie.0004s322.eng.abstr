Microvascular bone transplantation has become a routine procedure. The iliac crest, scapula, and fibula are the most common donor sites. These are used for reconstruction of tumor-related defects or after osteoradionecrosis. But additional indications have been developed as defects after trauma, extreme atrophy, or hemifacial microsomia. In the future, three-dimensional techniques will improve transplantation surgery and will enable the prefabrication of transplants.
