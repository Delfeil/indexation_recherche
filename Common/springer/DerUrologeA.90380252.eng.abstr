In the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma diagnosis increased about 15-20 %. The main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence. In the present autopsy series comprising 23.801 autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1,77 % in Jena and 1,55 % in Königgrätz (200.000 inhabitants each). Over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased.
