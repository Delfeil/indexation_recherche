K+ Channels and Cardiotoxicity of Drugs: Implications for Drug Toxicity Assessment - The time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the QT interval of the ECG and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK), which consists of a rapid component (IKr) and a slow component (IKs). Drugs that block cardiac IKr prolong the cardiac action potential (AP). Prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer QT interval on the ECG. During prolonged APs, increased inward currents induce early afterdepolarizations, which increase the risk of Torsades de pointes (TdP) cardiac arrhythmias. TdP arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent twisting of the electrical axis around the isoelectric line. It has a rate of 150 to 250 beats/min and it can occasionally degenerate into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal. The incidence of drug-induced TdP arrhythmias is highest among class IA and class III antiarrhythmic agents. However, under certain clinical conditions, also several non-cardiovascular medicinal products induce QT interval prolongations in the ECG or TdP arrhythmias. Since all drugs known to cause TdP block IKr, an early evaluation of possible effects on APs of cardiac myocytes expressing IKr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended. If in-vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce AP prolongation and/or K+ channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations,  either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to TdP arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies.
