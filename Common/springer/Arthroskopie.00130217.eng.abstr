The present study describes a new anteroinferior portal for the arthroscopic repair of Bankart lesions. The portal was performed in an outside-to-inside fashion with the patient in the beach-chair position. The blunt guide rod was inserted 8-10 cm distal from the palpable coracoid tip lateral of the deltopectoral groove, directed to the inferior glenoid rim at an angle of about 135 to the glenoid. An 8.25-mm cannula was passed over the rod into the joint. The portal was established in 11 cadaver shoulders for anatomic evaluation. The average distance of the axillary nerve was 2.4 cm (1.5-5 cm). Close proximity to the circumflex artery and its accompanying veins (three sisters) was noted (0.5-2.5 cm). In each specimen, the portal was located lateral to the conjoined tendon without the possibility of damaging the musculocutaneous nerve. The described technique was applied in 200 patients who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair by the senior author (A. B. I.). We noted only one hematoma, but no neural complications. The new inferior portal can be applied safely and allows optimal arthroscopic repair of Bankart lesions. For treatment of bony Bankart fractures, this portal also allows placement of the screw perpendicular to the fracture site, which is more difficult during an open approach.
