The present article reviews supracondylar and diacondylar fractures of the upper arm with reference to diagnostic procedures, concomitant lesions, classification, treatment strategy and possible complications. In the adult patient operative treatment is needed in the vast majority of cases; this is demanding and requires adequate experience. A dorsal approach by way of an olecranal osteotomy is best. Fractures are more common in children, and by far the most frequent are supracondylar extension fractures, followed by intra-articular fractures of the radial condyle. Even the recognition of a fracture of this kind can be difficult in a child's skeleton, and diagnostic aids are listed. In the case of dislocated supracondylar fractures it is helpful to perform fixation with Kirschner wires applied percutaneously; an open operation is needed as the primary procedure when a completely closed intervention is not possible. Fractures of the radial condyle must be accurately reset and fixed in a "watertight" manner as they are prone to disturbed fracture healing and defective growth. Our results of operative treatment over 10 years are detailed.
