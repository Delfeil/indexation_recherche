Forty-one patients demonstrating clinical symptoms for cerebral infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). In 8 patients only DWI showed the cerebral lesions clearly. One patient with positive DWI and T2WI suffered from HSV encephalitis. DWI is superior to T2WI in assessment of small cortical infarcts and cerebral infarction in patients with preexisting vascular lesions. DWI is not specific, so other causes like cerebral hematoma and encephalitis have to be considered.
