In a specific series war injuries in the trochanteric region were characterized; a limited methodological approach magnified the problem. Our experience and the treatment results (debridement, drainage and external fixation) are presented. The methodology, complications and final results are also given for 15 patients. Consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as spongioplasty or internal fixation conversion methods. The time to consolidation without complications was 28.6 weeks (24-36) and with complications (deep infections, chronic osteomyelitis) 40.8 weeks (28-68). In total, there was one poor result with angulation, shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent fistulation. The average follow-up was 22.7 months (1-34 months). Our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation. Under war conditions, primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results. Minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly.
