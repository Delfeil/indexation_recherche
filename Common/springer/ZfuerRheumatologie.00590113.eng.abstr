 The aim of a new prospective, multicenter trial on early rheumatoid arthritis is to evaluate parameters of potential relevance for the prediction of an erosive disease course. The integration of general practitoners, rheumatologists, arthritis care units and experimental research groups in a network structure is intended to improve the cooperation between basic and clinical research as well as the treatment of the patients. The final goal is to identify new parameters that may improve an early stratification of patients into the appropriate treatment areas.
