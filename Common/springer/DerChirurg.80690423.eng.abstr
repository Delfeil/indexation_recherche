 Performing prospective, randomized controlled studies in patients with severe acute pancreatitis is limited due to low disease incidence and organizational and financial problems. Thus, animal models simulating the clinical condition have been developed for testing innovative therapeutic procedures. Despite objections regarding the applicability of data obtained from animal experiments to clinical practice, the experience gained from these studies could not only be used in clinical study proposals but also, in part, directly influenced the clinical management of acute pancreatitis. This is illustrated by studies regarding the influence of contrast medium, isovolemic hemodilution and various antibiotics.
