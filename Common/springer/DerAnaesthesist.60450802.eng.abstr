The administration of dry anaesthetic gases for ventilation leads to morphological changes of the tracheobronchial epithelium that may cause postoperative pulmonary complications. Therefore, additional humidification with a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) is suggested for ventilation during anaesthesia, particularly when using semi-open breathing systems. Recommendations concerning the use of a HME in the semi-closed system are controversial. There are no data in the literature as to whether a HME improves mucociliary transport under these conditions. We therefore studied bronchial mucus transport velocity (BTV) with and without the use of a HME in the semi-closed circle system in humans.
