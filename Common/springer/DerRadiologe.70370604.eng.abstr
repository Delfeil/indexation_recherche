A recently developed X-ray unit for mammography using microfocal (spot size 0.12- 0.05 mm) direct magnification radiography will soon be introduced into clinical practice. Unit arrangement and tube construction have been demonstrated. Mean surface dose was measured using PMMA-phantoms. A dose reduction of up to 50 %was obtained in 1.7-fold magnification mammography (full sized views) compared with conventional techniques. The image quality was almost equivalent. However, in comparison with 1,7-fold magnification mammography, a comparable dose range for 4-fold magnifications with the microfocus system was measured with a substantial gain in spatial resolution. These findings satisfy the demands of a modern mammographic unit.
