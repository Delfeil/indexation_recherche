Restrictive dermopathy is a rare, fatal, autosomal recessive, congenital skin disease. Rigidity of translucent thin skin, which is thus highly vulnerable and tears, spontaneously causes intra-uterine fetal akinesia or hypokinesia deformation sequence (FADS), characteristic dysmorphic facies with fixed open mouth in O position, and generalized joint contractures (arthrogryposis). Polyhydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia are distinctive manifestations, leading to respiratory insufficiency and premature delivery at about 31 weeks of gestation. We report on a case of a prematurely born infant who presented with the typical morphological features and describe the light- and electronmicroscopical findings as described in the literature.
