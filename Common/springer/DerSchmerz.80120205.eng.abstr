Problem: Comprehensive diagnosis of pain comprises assessment of subjectively felt pain as one necessary component. Modern approaches are multidimensional (differentiation between sensory and affective parts; multiple sub-aspects of sensory pain) and go far beyond single-item-methods, whose utility remain questionable not only regarding the contents but for measurement purposes as well. One of these modern instruments of pain assessment, the Pain Experience Scale (German: Schmerzempfindungsskala, SES), served as original for the development of a computerized version. The study aimed to establish whether this computer version is equivalent to the paper-pencil original.
