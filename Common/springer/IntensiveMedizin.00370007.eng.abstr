 The assessment of the impaired sympathetic-vagal balance provides in many disorders unique information concerning prognosis and treatment strategies. Especially the indications for using the heart rate variability analysis and the baroreflex sensitivity evaluation are well defined and proven in large prospective studies. The ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities are tools which could improve prediction of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and the prognosis of patients with advanced chronic heart failure. They are at this stage in the focus of intense research. Especially sepsis and MODS, as ICU-relevant disorders, are coupled with an impairment of autonomic function. Thus, the reduction of heart rate variability in such patients culminated in the loss of the nerval-humoral organ interaction ("uncoupling of biological oscillators") hypothesis. This idea nowadays contributes to the pathophysiological concept of the clinical manifestations of sepsis and MODS.
