 An elderly woman was found dead in her farm house lying in a pool of blood and was partially unclothed. Blood was also discovered in several rooms on the first floor. The investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual murder. The autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis. The woman has obviously been surprised by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage. A similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described.
