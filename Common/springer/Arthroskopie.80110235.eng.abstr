Surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-B3 and C1- C3) makes high demands on traumatological management. By using modern, minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta-articular fractures, it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result. The aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures. Arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma, but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation, as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra-articular injuries, a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods. From a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients at our clinic from September 1994 to January 1998. The follow-up of a total of 17 patients revealed good recoveries when assayed by means of the Lysholm and Delamarter score. We suggest that arthroscopically assisted, minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of AO classification 41 C1-C3 fractures.
