 We report the case of a 71-year-old patient who had a laryngectomy 16 years ago because of a laryngeal carcinoma and achieved voice restoration by esophageal speech. Now a squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus had been diagnosed and was treated with a subtotal esophagectomy, stomach transposition, and collar anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient remained esophageal speech without loss of quality.
