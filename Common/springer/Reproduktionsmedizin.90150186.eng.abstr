This is a report on a patient who was treated for years for sterility and eventually became pregnant although she did not want to have a child. Tracing the striking psychodynamics of this case, a strong plea is made for fertility treatment which takes the reasons behind the woman's wish to become pregnant into account rather than just blindly consenting to treat everyone who seeks medical help to conceive a child. Help is offered in identifying those patients who are especially at risk amongst the totality of patients labelled as "longing for a child".
