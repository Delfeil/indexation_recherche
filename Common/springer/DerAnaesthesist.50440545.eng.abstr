After cardiac surgery, transient renal dysfunction often occurs. Regional differentiation of these processes is possible only using invasive techniques, including renal biopsy. Approximately 30 different plasma protein components have been identified in the urine of healthy individuals by means of qualitative and quantitative immunochemical methods. The detection of microalbuminuria has high diagnostic relevance for the early diagnosis of renal damage at a reversible stage. One typical urinary protein is Tamm-Horsfall protein (THp). After histochemical staining of human kidney sections, activity is seen in the loop of Henle and initial distal tubule. The assay of -1 microglobulin (MG) in urine is considered one of the most efficient laboratory parameters for the diagnosis of tubular lesions. Serum concentrations of -1 MG are less dependent on extrarenal changes than are those of other low-molecular-weight proteins. -2 MG is also one of the standards used in recent years for diagnostic relevance. Urinary albumin excretion, normaly less than 30 mg per day, sometimes increases after glomerular damage. Some renal function tests are used daily in many intensive care units, e.g. creatinine clearance (CCr) or urea and sodium excretion. Renal dysfunction should, however, be further examined to localise regional damage and to seek new clinical standards in addition to the conventional tests.
