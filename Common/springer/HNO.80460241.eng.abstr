With the aid of a mechanical middle ear model (MMM) the sound transmission properties of different middle ear implants were investigated. Input of the MMM involved a broad-band signal from 100 to 5000 Hz that was supplied by a miniaturized loudspeaker. Displacement of an artificial stapes footplate was measured by a fiberoptic probe. The transfer functions of four different total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORPs) of different materials and shapes were compared. Three of the devices revealed similar transfer functions which corresponded to the typical curve of the normal middle ear. One of the prostheses demonstrated a high-frequency deterioration of approximately 5 dB. This effect was explained by a 3- to 6-times higher mass of the implant when compared to the others. Altogether, the weight of the prosthesis seems to have the most marked impact on sound transmission to the inner ear, whereas stiffness of the implant itself is less crucial as long as it can be regarded as a rigid body.
