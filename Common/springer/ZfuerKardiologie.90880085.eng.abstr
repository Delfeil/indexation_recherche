In secondary prevention, statins are cost-effective and even more cost-effective than other lipid lowering drugs. Statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris. For secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, statins should be administered generously. In primary prevention, statins are effective but not cost-efficient. Unfavorable results have to be expected especially in premenopausal women, younger patients, and in those with a low risk factor profile. For population based primary prevention, only dietary measures can be advocated; however, apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven. Preventive measures have their own prize; in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it. Therefore, such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the "direct" medical costs. Furthermore, successful prevention of coronary heart disease leads, due to life-prolongation, to an increase in people out of work and in disabled patients due to age and/or disease. Therefore, an increase especially of the "indirect" costs for unemployment, pension, nursing homes, etc. must be expected.
