Beginning in the 1920s Wilhelm Reich developed the fundamental concepts of a body-oriented psychotherapy out of psychoanalysis. He started from considerations of egopathology, sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns. Characterological and bodily attitudes were understood as defence-patterns against emotions, which function not only psychologically but also bodily. Thus he began to mobilize repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions. That way their meaning in the person's history could be understood and a self-healing process restarted. This approach to release constrained energy is still valid for neoreichian schools such as bioenergetics, biodynamics, biosynthesis and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy. Bodily processes are used as indicators for the processes and successes of therapies. Besides there are impulses in modern body psychotherapies to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts.
