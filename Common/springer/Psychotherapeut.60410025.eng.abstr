In this article, a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed, which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians. This model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help. The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance has three elements: (1.) a QA-Inventory for routine monitoring; (2.) rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and (3.) a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists (quality circles). The focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results. It is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles, where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed. This feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients. The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of Quality Assurance, which is aimed at assuring and improving the quality and rationality of the psychotherapeutic service.
