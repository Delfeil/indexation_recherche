Endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation. Other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery, not at the site of the pathology. With the transforaminal approach, treatment in the epidural space has become possible. In a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls, risks, and complications of transforaminal surgery. Patient satisfaction and acceptance of the method were documented. Some 27 patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space, excluding extremely medially situated herniations, were treated. We used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia. The treated levels were L5/S1 (11), L4/5 (12), L3/4 (3), and L2/3 (1). All areas could be reached by this approach. One procedure had to be abandoned because of instrumentation problems. One patient had recurrent disk herniation and had an open procedure. Two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain. No signs of reherniation could be found in these cases, but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring. One patient developed spondylodiscitis. Minor complications were trancient root paresthesia and headache postoperatively. Postoperative MRI or CT scans revealed only little scar tissue. This impression was supported in the open revisions we performed. Clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly. Endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve, even when surgeons are acquainted with the posterolateral approach and arthroskopic surgery. However, it offers a good alternative to other minimally invasive procedures and has to be seen as a good alternative to open disk surgery, too.
