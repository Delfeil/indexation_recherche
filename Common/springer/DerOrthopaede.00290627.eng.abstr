Using CT-based 3D-data of human femora, it is possible to simulate the THR very realistically by a newly developed fit program. The evaluation of OP simulations of different prostheses systems on more than 200 femora showed that a large number of hip joints can only be reconstructed unsatisfactorily by standard stems regarding intramedullary fit and joint geometry. This could be minimized by optimized off-the-shelf prostheses, but there is still a remainder that can only be satisfactorily reconstructed by customized devices. The decision of choosing a standard or custom device for each individual case can be made by the same fit program using CT-data of the femur. Planning with conventional X-rays only shows major restrictions.
