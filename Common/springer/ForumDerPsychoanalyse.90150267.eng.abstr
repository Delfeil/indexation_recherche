 The feeling of disgust is the subject of the following work. After a phenomenological description of disgust the meaning of this feeling within the psychical apparatus is explored. Against the background of various psychoanalytical theories, the mostly sporadic observations of some authors (e.g. Freud, Klein, Jacobson and Krause) are interpreted. Lastly a thesis on the meaning of disgust within the psychical apparatus is developed. Disgust and the coupled involuntary reactions serve to protect a fragile ego from decompensation and the restitution of the boundary between in- and outside.
