A critical review of current approaches and principles of cognitive remediation strategies in rehabilitation of schizophrenia is given. Selection of cognitive functions targeted in compensatory training programs could be based on results of neuropsychological predictor research on social and vocational functioning in community and neuropsychological rate limiting factors in rehabilitation. Methodological flaws in data base, missing of task analysis of more complex skills like social perception, social skills and interpersonal problem solving and the lack of evaluation of training generalization on work performance are discussed. Finally the cognitive remediation program developed in the Department of General Psychiatry and Psychotherapy/University of Freiburg, Germany is proposed. The components focused on training in attention, memory, and executive function (decision making, planning). Compensatory strategy building, and computer-mediated automatization are integrated in a group settting.
