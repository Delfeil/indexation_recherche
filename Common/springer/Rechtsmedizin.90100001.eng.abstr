 Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide. Characteristic signs of malaria are special macroscopic and microscopic organ changes, which may also be seen in postmortem examinations. Modern diagnostic tools allow a fast and reliable diagnosis. The symptoms of malaria are rather unspecific, so the correct diagnosis may be difficult, especially if the doctor is not informed about the patient having been abroad. The cases presented also point out possible legal consequences of a missed diagnosis.
