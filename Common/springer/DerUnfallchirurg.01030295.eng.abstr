A huge amount of publications is existing dealing with topics of operative or nonopervative treatment, results and follow-up of fractures of the os calcis. Comparing the different studies one can see that there are a lot of different scores applicated for follow-up and outcome. Therefore it's difficult or impossible to compare the results of the different publications. The problems are discussed while evaluating own results of operative treated fractures of the os calcis. Between 1993 and 1996 we treated 27 fractures with ORIF (open reduction and internal fixation). 25 of the patients could be followed-up after a mean of 22,1 months. For follow-up three recently published scores, the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale (AOFAS), the Calcaneal Fractures Scoring System (CFSS) according to Kerr and the Functional Outcome Assessment-Score (FOA) according to Thordarson were used.
