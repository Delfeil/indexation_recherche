Children of mothers chronically infected with hepatitis-C-virus (HCV) during pregnancy and delivery were prospectively followed. 90 children born to 85 infected mothers were included in our study; nine of the mothers were known to be co-infected with HIV-1. These 90 children were first tested within 60 days after birth and followed for at least three months. Three of the 90 children became infected perinatally with HCV as shown by persistence of antibodies after 2 years of life and a positive result in the RT-PCR. One of these 3 children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase values, but is otherwise clinically well, likewise the other 2 infected children. 54 of the 87 uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year.
