Carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of ominous prognosis if not adequately treated. To a large extent the probability of positive lymph nodes is determined by the grade of the primary lesion. In turn the number of positive nodes greatly influences the survival. In the past the complications of radical ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy have decreased their timely indication. If delayed lymphadenectomy is performed, the survival rate is reduced by approximately 50 % as compared to the results of immediate lymphadenectomy. The modified inguinal lymphadenectomy described by Catalona leads to less complications. If performed without delay it should lead to improved survival in patients with higher stage and high grade penile cancer. Recently suggested employment of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherpy may further enhance the survival.
