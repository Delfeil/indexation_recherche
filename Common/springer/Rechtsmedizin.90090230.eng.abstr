 We report the case of a 58-year-old man in whom the diagnosis of an aortopulmonary window was not made until the age of 39 and present clinical and pathomorphogical findings of this rare congenital malformation. Due to fixed pulmonary hypertension and right-to-left shunting (Eisenmengers reaction), surgical treatment was no longer possible. The lungs of the deceased showed secondary sclerosis of the pulmonary arteries in an extreme form and thrombosed aneurysms in both main trunks of the pulmonary artery. The other findings - bronchial carcinoma in association with asbestos-associated hyaline plaques of the pleura - indicate an occupational disease (number 4104). Due to the occupational disease the occurrence of death was presumably accelerated by at least 1 year.
