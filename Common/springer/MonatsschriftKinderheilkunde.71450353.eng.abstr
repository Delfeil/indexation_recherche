Lung transplantation in patients with cystic fibrosis is generally performed as double lung transplantation. We report the case of an 11 year old boy in whom single lung transplantation was performed. The diagnosis was made in early childhood in the presence of chronic maldigestion and intercurrent pneumonia by sweat test. A pneumonectomy of the right lung was performed in March 1994 after failure of conservative therapy and destruction of the right lung. In November 1994 the boy underwent a left sided lung transplantation from a 13 year old donor. There were no major complications during operation. The boy was extubated 5 days after transplantation and was discharged on day 55.  Diskussion: This case report elucidates that single lung transplantation can be considered an option for patients with end-stage cystic fibrosis.
