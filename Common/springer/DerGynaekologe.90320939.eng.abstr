Since the 1970 s careful documentation of treatments performed or not performed has been part of a doctor's duties. This includes patient-related matters such as consent, refusal or actions taken contrary to medical advice. If an intervention is not documented, it is assumed in the event of a claim for damages in the patient's favour that the treatment has not taken place. In gynaecology and obstetrics there are frequent legal actions as the result of defective documentation, especially in the sectors of early cancer diagnosis, pregnancy counselling and prenatal diagnosis, and also in the case of operative interventions. Because of the different persons involved and the various areas of responsibility, documentation of the birth process is particularly difficult. It should therefore be decided at the start who is to note down its course. When endoscopic investigations are carried out it seems advisable to take short video sequences recording the salient points. Patients have a fundamental right to sight of their treatment records. In the event of a patient's death the next of kin are entitled to sight of the records, providing the patient has not left any formal request that they be kept secret.
