  Objective: Interim results of successful balloon angioplasty for total coronary occlusions (TCO) are disappointing due to the high rate of restenosis and reocclusion. Adjunctive stenting has been suggested to improve patency rate after recanalization of total coronary occlusions (TCO); however, this concept of protective stenting has not been substantiated in a case control study.
