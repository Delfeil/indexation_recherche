Classification of cosmetics, which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents, is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists. Their definition within the EU and the respective European directives, replacing national laws step by step, will be briefly presented. The problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be discusssed in detail by examples from clinical practice. Finally, we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing "medicinally" active cosmetics, and in the pharmaceutical industry towards "cosmetically" oriented medicinal products as part of a current "life-style" ideology. In some clinical dermatological fields these active substances may allow the dermatologists to use cosmetics as topical therapeutic agents.
