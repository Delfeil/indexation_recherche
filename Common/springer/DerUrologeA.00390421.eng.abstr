Hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male. The choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible. To date, transdermal testosterone systems appear to be best suited for substitution therapy in the ageing male. Future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate. Any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely, especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate.
