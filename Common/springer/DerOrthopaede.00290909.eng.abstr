Degenerative arthrosis of the shoulder is less commonly diagnosed than at the joints of the lower extremity. The shoulder joint does not bear weight and some of the mechanical stresses are taken up by the subacromial space. However, anatomical studies reveal a significant incidence of degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joint with increasing age. Arthrosis is caused by mechanical loading, rotator cuff defects, and abnormal joint motion following surgery.
