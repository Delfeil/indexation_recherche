Tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long-term ventilated ICU patients. In the last few years, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy. Recently, there is another percutaneous technique according to Fantoni with translaryngeal airway access (TLT) available. Our study seeks to evaluate TLT in terms of complications and practicability. In 47 patients of our surgical ICU, elective TLT was performed. Mean operative time was 9.8 +/- 10.9 (range 6-27) minutes. Severe complications, such as bleeding, aspiration or infection of the tracheostoma have never been noted. A slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in 25 patients intraoperatively, demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily. However, no patient became hypoxic during the procedure.Since during the procedure gas exchange may worsen, TLT should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80%. Despite the fact that severe complications associated with TLT have recently not yet been reported, physicians who perform TLT should be well-trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy, too. According to our present data, TLT seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to PDT. Nevertheless, for a definiteve evaluation of TLT, further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary.
