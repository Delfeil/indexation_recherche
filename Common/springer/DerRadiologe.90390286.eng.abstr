Radiologic information systems (RIS) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are becoming increasingly widespread. This leads to new demands on the integration of the individual, formerly independent information systems (RIS, modalities, PACS). Possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced. Besides the detailed description of different realizations of system communication, its role in the PACS at the university hospital in Freiburg is explained. The integration of different information systems still requires the use of proprietary interfaces. An appropriate integration generally has been realized in Freiburg. In the near future DICOM basic worklist management will standardize system integration and render an interdepartmental workflow concept possible. Even though an available communication standard exists, not all problems in the RIS-modality interface are solved. Different data models in the various RI systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard. Thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard.
