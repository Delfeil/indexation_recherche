In the way risk issues in environmental and health protection politics are handeled, a great discrepancy is obvious between scientifically based, well established quantitative risk assessment procedures on one side and the perception of risk in the society on the other. One reason for this is the insufficient participation of relevant concerned societal groups in all procedures of risk assessment and standard setting in the health related environmental protection. Based on five postulates, the acceptable risk as a theoretical basis for regulations in health and environmental protection will be developed. Starting point of the determination of an acceptable risk is a public discourse about the way the society is willing to handle risk issues. All relevant concerned groups within the society should have a fair chance of participation. Risk assessment and standard setting only get their democratic authorisation by fair participation.
