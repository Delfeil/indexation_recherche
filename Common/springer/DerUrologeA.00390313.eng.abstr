Abstract   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most useful marker in the early detection of prostate cancer and in the monitoring of patients with this diagnosis. Molecular forms of PSA and human kallikrein 2 (hK2) have been used to discriminate between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer, as well as for the detection of prostate cancer within the gray zone of PSA.
