In this article current indications and limitations of neuromuscular monitoring are reviewed. Attention is mainly focused on detection of residual curarisation. New insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed. Surprisingly in this context, despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring, its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine. A lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring.
