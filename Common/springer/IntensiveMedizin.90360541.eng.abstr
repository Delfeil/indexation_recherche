 Ethylene dichloride (EDC) is used as a solvent and in the rubber, plastic, and insecticide industry. The fatal adult dose is below 20 ml. Poisoning can occur from inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption. EDC depresses almost all cells, but essentially those of the central nervous system, liver, kidneys, and heart. Death is usually due to liver or central nervous failure.
