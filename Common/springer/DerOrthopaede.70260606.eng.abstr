Neurotization procedures represent an important therapeutic option in patients with complete root avulsion due to traumatic brachial plexus injuries. A variety of normal donor nerves can be used, including intercostal nerves, accessory nerve, parts of the cervical plexus, phrenic nerve, and/or the contralateral C7 nerve root. The reconstructive neurotization procedure should be performed within 3-6 months following the trauma and, when successful, can lead to substantial improvement in motor function for the shoulder and upper arm and in sensory function for the forearm, hand and finger region. Neurotization can also be combined with neurolysis and/or transplantation to restore upper limb motor and sensory function in order to achieve greater therapeutic benefit for patients with posttraumatic brachial plexus lesions.
