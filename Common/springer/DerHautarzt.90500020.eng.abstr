Due to its high prevalence, atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice. The chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system. We describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our Department of Dermatology. A high degree of standardization is combined with a high measure of individual care. The aims of this clinic are an optimized outpatient management of atopic dermatitis, the gathering of epidemiologic data, the performance of controlled studies, and potentially the reduction of costs.
