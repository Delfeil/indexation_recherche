Lichen aureus is a special localized variant of purpura pigmentosa chronica. A patient presented with an unusual striate and segmental or zosteriform distribution of lichen aureus involving the left leg and lower abdominal area. Histology showed the characteristic dense band-like infiltrate consisting mainly of small lymphocytes and numerous hemosiderin-containing macrophages. No underlying infection or medication could be identified as a trigger. The lesions did not respond well to topical corticosteroid therapy.
