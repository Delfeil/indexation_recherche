Shoulder instability and secondary impingement syndrome are common problems seen in athletes who perform repetitive overhead activities. Beside several functional and anatomical factors the shoulder mechanics during throwing and tennis serve provokes these injuries. The dynamic joint stability plays an important role during this typical glenohumeral pathology. After the precise examination and classification a non-operative treatment should be started consisting out of several physical and active components. To improve the dynamic neuromotor control of the athlets shoulder, exercise routines in rehabilitation and prevention should more concentrate on proprioception and kinesthesia.
