 Intergration of nociceptive signaling comprises peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal sites of the nervous system. Various excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter and -modulator systems participate in pain processing and modulation. Chronic pain states are associated with functional and structural alterations of nociceptive pathways. The numerous dynamic changes in the pharmacologically distinct systems offer novel targets for selective pharmacotherapy.
