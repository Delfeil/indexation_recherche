The implantation of a Wallstent prosthesis is a minimally invasive alternative to conventional TUR-P for the treatment of infravesical obstruction owing to benign prostatic hyperplasia. We report on the long-term follow-up of 37 patients with a high-risk status for TUR-P who have been implanted since May 1990. The ASA status was: ASA I: 0, ASA II: 2, ASA III: 17 and ASA IV: 18 patients. The median follow-up is now 38.5 months. Directly after implantation, a medium increase in the maximum flow-rate from 7.5 ml/s to 16.9 ml/s was documented. Residual urine was reduced from 120 to 24.2 ml on average. After 12, 18, 24 and 36 months, average maximum flow rates of 16.1, 16.7, 12.0 and 11.6 ml/s were evaluated. The corresponding residual urine was 50.3, 121.1, 56.8 and 65 ml, respectively. Also, micturition frequency decreased from 12.4 preoperatively to 8.3, 7.6, 8.0, and 8.4 per day on average. Nearly all patients reported perineal discomfort in the 1st weeks after implantation. For this reason, the stent had to be removed in 1 patient on the 45th postoperative day. In addition, a dislocated stent had to be replaced in 2 patients. Six of 15 retention patients presented with persisting detrusor dysfunction after implantation and were therefore discharged with a suprapubic tube. Endoscopic controls showed complete urothelial coverage in 78 % of our patients after 6 months. After 18 months all stents were completely covered. Long-term follow-up showed reobstruction in 6 of 37 patients (16.7 %) and signs of incontinence in 4 of 37 (10.8 %). The late complication rate is therefore calculated at 27.5 %. Stent-related deaths could not be found. We conclude that Wallstent implantation into the prostatic urethra is an alternative to TUR-P for patients at high risk from surgery. The good postoperative results also remain stable during long-term follow-up.
