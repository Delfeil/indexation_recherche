In Germany there is still an urgent need for action in regard to screening for breast cancer. The announcement of research projects for mammography screening proves this. The following reports the results of the Munich field study. In 2 years, 2489 breast cancer cases were registered (status 6/98). Screening data were available for 1319 patients. The reduction in mortality, found in randomized studies, due to mammography in women over 50 years old was confirmed.  A relative reduction of 44.8% in 10-year mortality could be estimated through mammography and 25.1% through palpation, in comparison with "doing nothing". We could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the Munich region. If the mammographies carried out today were used at 2-year intervals for women aged between 50 and 70 years, then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70% of the women. The known facts regarding the population-based mortality and regarding the acceptance of the palpation screening and frequency of mammography are additional aspects for inclusion in the discussion of what research projects in Germany are and what they should fulfill.
