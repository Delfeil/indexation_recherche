An investigation of 122 knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the meniscofemoral ligaments (MFL) Humphry and Wrisberg. Of the knees examined, 96% showed one or more ligaments, the incidence was independent of gender or age. The osseous parameters of the dorsal and ventral notch as well as the diacondylar width did not correlate with the incidence of MFL. The ventral notch width index (NWI) after Souryal was 0.22 in females and 0.24 in males. A dorsal notch width index (dNWI), which has not been described so far, was 0.26 in females and 0.28 in males. The ligamentum meniscofemorale posterius (Wrisberg) showed distinct morphological variations. This resulted in a classification of type I-III. The results of the study underline the importance of the MFL for knee joint function including stabilization, proprioception, and meniscal positioning.
