 ORIF management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type A3 of the A0 classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments, particularly when only the sliding hip-screw is used for fixation. A connectable butt-press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation. We review the results with this fixation technique in 22 elderly patients with an average age of 76 years who presented with highly unstable trochanteric fracture of the A3 type. Three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed. The other 19 were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred. Complaints, leg shortening and changes in the CCD angle were recorded. Furthermore, the mobility score was determined. Although the patients were able to bear full weight after the operation, no lateral dislocation of fragments was observed. Only 1 patient had a varus dislocation of 5  ° until the fracture had consolidated. This was due to severe osteopenia and subsequent dislocation of the screw within the femoral head. No pseudarthrosis, osteitis or rotational malalignment was noted. Five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained. On the basis of this review, we recommend the use of this new connectable buttress plate with sliding hip screws because it provides sifficient fixation of highly unstable fractures of type A3.
