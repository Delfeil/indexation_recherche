Enteroviruses of the Picornaviridae and primarily coxsackieviruses of group B (CVB) can be detected in humans and various experimental murine models of acute myocarditis and chronic heart muscle diseases indicating enterovirus persistence in the myocardium. Persistent myocardial infection is characterized by restricted viral replication and gene expression in myocytes capable of sustaining chronic inflammation. Viral cytotoxicity was found to be crucial for organ pathology both during acute and persistent infection.
