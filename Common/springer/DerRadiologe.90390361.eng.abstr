For imaging of renal pathology a broad spectrum of radiologic diagnostic procedures are available which are, sometimes and particularly more recently, competing among each other in their diagnostic yield and relevance. For tumorous lesions ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic reso-nance imaging are performed predominantly. Angiography is no longer required with the exception of highly selected cases and in some specific preoperative workup requirements. Until recently, catheter based digital subtraction angiography has been consid- ered as gold standard. However, non-invasive techniques such as CT-angiography and MR-angiography are evolving parallel to their quantum leap of resolutions and readiness to use. Nevertheless, well accepted criteria for quality assessement of these new modalities are still lacking. More comparison studies are urgently warranted. Despite the availability of ultrashort pulse sequences applying the T1 relaxation reduction effect of gadolinium enhanced MR techniques overestimation of renal artery stenosis still po-ses a substantial problem. Renal intervention implies a variety of procedures such as plain angioplasty, stent placement, embolization of traumatic and both benign and malignant tumors. These methods have emerged over the last two decades from a more experimental nature to a fully accepted treatment option. When renal artery angioplasty is embedded in an aggressive approach including stenting as an adjunct for more complex cases, renal ostial lesions and a well organized follow-up regimen its therapeutic potential for treatment of renal insufficiency, malignant hypertension, for organ preservation bears a very high potential. Provided adequat periinterventional drug regimen restenosis rates may be as low as 10%. In highly selected cases capillary embolization might be used as an alternative to nephrectomy with a similar clinical outcome. Particularly the development of superselective small caliber embolization catheters parallel to further refinement of embolization material has aided to use superselective occlusion techniques in benign vascular lesions and renal trauma.
