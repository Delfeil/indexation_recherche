 The prevention of severe late postsplenectomy infection by vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial. This paper reviews the literature and presents a protocol for postsplenectomy adults. Prophylaxis should be adapted to the underlying disease. Every patient has to be informed about the consequences of splenectomy. Depending on the underlying disease, vaccination is recommended against pneumococci, Hemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is not advised in adults.
