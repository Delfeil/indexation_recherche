In common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury. An exact diagnosis is mandatory as well as a differentiated therapy. Especially the correct decision about the therapy (operative vs conservative) including the technical demanding operative procedures is based on an experienced surgeon. These patients should be transferred to a specialised centre.
