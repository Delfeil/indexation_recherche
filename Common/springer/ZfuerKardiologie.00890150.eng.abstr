 Three-dimensional echocardiography offers new opportunities for clinical cardiology and the solution of scientific questions. Data acquisition is possible using different techniques: (1) Realtime 3D echocardiography with matrix-array transducers is the most promising approach, but is still limited by several difficulties; (2) 3D reconstruction is based on a number of sequentially acquired 2D image planes (like in multiplane TEE), which are put together afterwards. There are 2 ways of data analysis.
