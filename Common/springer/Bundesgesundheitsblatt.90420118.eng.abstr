According to the experience of the German organisations for blood and plasma donation it is very important to increase the willingness to donate blood or plasma by repeated information and motivation campaigns, especially because donations are voluntarily. The campaign called "Blood and Plasma Donation. Each drop helps" was initiated as a cooperative campaign of all organisations involved in blood and plasma donation. The goals of the campaign are to give the public insights to the necessity and urgency of blood donation for the intended self-sufficiency, especially for plasma and to gain new donators for the future.
