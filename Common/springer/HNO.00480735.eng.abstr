Background and objective. The majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery. In problematic cases, however, optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved. In these cases, external frontal sinus surgery is indicated.
