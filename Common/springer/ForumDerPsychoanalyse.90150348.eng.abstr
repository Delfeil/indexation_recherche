The expulsion of Freud and of psychoanalysis from Nazi-Germany was a real catastrophe in the history of psychoanalysis. To cope with its consequences is only possible through long-term and very hard work. German psychoanalysts have still to be preoccupied with their guilt incurred when agreeing to the exclusion of the Jewish members and accepting psychoanalysis to be conformed and distorted. Although recovery and recollection of Freudian psychoanalysis has begun soon after 1945, the process of remembering and working through is still challenging bravery and authenticity of psychoanalysts.
