 Psychotic behavior is typically interpreted as the consequence of somato-psychic decompensations of the CNS, a concept within which the vulnerability-stress-concept plays a central mediating role. The contrary conceptualization, namely to envisage psychoses from the point of view of psychosomatics, appears fruitful, if the question is raised, as to which psychic"challenges" lead to an internal destabilization of equilibrium states between counteracting neuronal systems. In this context it can be shown that "neuro-constructivism" represents a crucial model of understanding of the interaction between internal "censorship", reality-hypotheses and sensory data. Psychotic behavior is interpreted as a decompensation of mechanisms of censorship.
