 Background: Considering the high recurrence rate after conventional inguinal hernia repair, the totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been used. Methods: The present experience of the authors embraces 1085 patients with a total of 1717 inguinal hernias, including 200 recurrences. The operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and tricks. Results: Analysis of the data concerning the first 403 patients with 1 year complete follow-up reveals a mean (SEM) operating time of 42 (1.2) min for unilateral and 58 (1.0) min for bilateral hernia repair. Mean (SEM) postoperative hospital stay was 2 (0.04) days. Complication rates during and after operation were 0.3 % and 3.3 % respectively. The morbidity rate at 1 month after operation was 3.5 %. The recurrence rate was 0.3 % at 1-year follow-up. Conclusion: Totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is safe and reproducible for any type of primary or recurrent inguinal hernia, even in patients with previous subumbilical surgery or severe systemic disease. Careful follow-up is mandatory to assess the late recurrence rate.
