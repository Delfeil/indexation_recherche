Microsurgery has entered its third generation. Functional and aesthetic requirements have been steadily increased with the refinements of microsurgery. The new principle of prefabricated flaps are another step to match these requirements. These prefabricated flaps can either be created by expanding known flap donor sites or creating entirely new flaps by implanting AV-loops or vascularized fascia. Principles and indications of this new technique will be elucidated by clinical examples.
