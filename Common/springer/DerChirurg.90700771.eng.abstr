 Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children. In recent years this abnormality has also been observed in adults with chronic constipation. The aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease. The investigation was performed with 10 adults with IND, compared with 10 healthy control probands. The best diagnostic indicator of IND proved to be the detection of 6-10 giant ganglia with more than 7 nerve cells in 15 biopsy sections. IND is an interesting cause of chronic constipation which can be histologically verified.
