The Scottish physician James Braid (1795-1860) was one of the ancestors of psychotherapy, because he invented the idea and the "classical" technique of hypnosis. With his interpretation of hypnotical phenomena on a neurophysiological basis, he started the scientific research in hypnosis, which was continued by Charcot and the "Nancy school" in the 1880ies. The 200th anniversary of his birth is an occasion to remember his life and work, which is hardly known in German speaking countries today.
