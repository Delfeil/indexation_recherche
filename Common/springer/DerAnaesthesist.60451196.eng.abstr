In prehospital emergency treatment, the timely establishment of a secure vascular access, especially in infants and small children, can be difficult or even impossible. An alternative to the puncture of peripheral or central veins is intraosseous (IO) puncture [6, 7]. However, experience with this method in prehospital emergency medicine within the Federal Republic of Germany is extremely limited at present [25]. After intensive theoretical and practical training of our trauma anaesthesiologists, IO puncture was introduced in our rescue helicopter program "Christoph 22" as an alternative to peripheral or central venous puncture in the prehospital treatment of patients up to 6 years of age. IO puncture is indicated after a maximum of three failed peripheral venous puncture attempts. The purpose of this study was to collect data and summarise first-hand experience on the prehospital use of the IO method as well as the practicability of our prescribed IO puncture algorithm in order to subject them to critical review and evaluation.
