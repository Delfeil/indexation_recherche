Chest compressions are a simple and efficient measure during CPR and well established since many years. However, whether they lead to serious complications yet needs to be answered. Among them thoracic fractures and injuries of inner organs (cardiac, hepatic, splenic) are well known. Additionally fat embolism of the lungs as well as other organs have been described. Concerning the pathogenesis different theories are discussed in the literature. This article reviews the most relevant literature of the last decades. Studies focusing on fat embolism have especially been carried out in trauma surgery and pathology. The actual incidence of fat embolism during trauma, long bone surgery, shock and CPR seems to be rather high. However a clinical manifestation is rarely apparent. Especially after (unsuccessful) CPR pathological studies revealed the degree of fat embolism to be rather low. Because specific studies on the incidence of fat embolism during CPR lack completly, the significance for CPR is unknown and can only be speculated on.
