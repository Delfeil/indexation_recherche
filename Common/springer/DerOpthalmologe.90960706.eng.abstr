Purpose: Most of the antiglaucomatous drugs affect ocular blood flow. Blood flow of the anterior uvea under the effect of glaucoma medication has been described in the literature, but measurement of microcirculation at the posterior pole correlated to glaucoma medication is rarely found. We present a placebo-controlled study in which we focused on the short and long-term effects of topical dipivefrine 0.1 % on the microcirculation of the retina and optic nerve head.
