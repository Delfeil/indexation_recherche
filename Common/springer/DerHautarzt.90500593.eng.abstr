Acanthosis nigricans is a hyperkeratotic mucocutaneous eruption of heterogenous etiology which is characterized by hyperpigmentation, velvety cutaneous thickening, intensified skin markings and development of verrucous excrescences typically involving the intertriginous areas. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is most often associated with an abdominal adenocarcinoma frequently unresectable at the time of diagnosis. We report on the rare association of acanthosis nigricans with a transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Symptomatic treatment with topical calcipotriol significantly reduced the hyperkeratotic and papillomatous skin changes.
