The following double-blind, randomised study dealt with three questions: (1) Is a multidimensional psychometric rating scale suitable for the measurement of mood before anaesthesia? (2) What are the effects of the new benzodiazepine-like drug zolpidem on preoperative mood compared with phenobarbital? (3) Is the combination with Promethazine suggestive?
