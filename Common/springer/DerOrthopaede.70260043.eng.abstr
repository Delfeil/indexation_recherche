For examination of the infant hip we cannot do without the use of an imaging method. The interpretation of ultrasound and X-ray studies does not always lead to uniform results. To clear up the so far unknown relationship between ultrasound and X-ray studies, sonomorphologic and radiomorphologic examinations were performed on 14 hip joints of children between 36 weeks and 121/2 months of age. A discrepancy between the X-ray and ultrasound image is always found when the contour line of the acetabulum does not correspond to the mid-portion but rather to the ventral or dorsal section of the acetabulum in correct projection of the X-ray image. The evaluation of the ultrasound image is then based on a bony shape differing from the one on the X-ray image. If the radiologic contour line of the acetabulum is determined by the mid-portion of the acetabulum, the angle of the acetabulum in the X-ray image and the alpha angle in the ultrasound image always add up to 90  °. This leads to the conclusion that a correspondence between ultrasound and X-ray findings only exists when the mid-portion of the acetabulum defines the acetabular contour line in the X-ray image. Generally, however, there is no constant relation between the X-ray summation image and the ultrasound image. The maximum error found by experiment is 8  ° in the X-ray determination of the acetabular angle, 11  ° in the ultrasound determination of the alpha angle and 28  ° in the ultrasound determination of the beta angle. The ultrasound examination has a higher value regardless of its margin of error, which is inherent in any metric method, because the critical mid-portion of the acetabulum can be judged with this procedure. We are of the opinion that the X-ray image is not decisive for therapy and prognostic assessment in these cases.
