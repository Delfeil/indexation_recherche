 Dissection of the ascending aorta (type A) develops in 0.6% of patients late after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and 15% of type A dissections reveal a history of AVR. Predictors of dissection at the AVR, however, have not been characterized.   A study group of 33 type A dissections had aortic surgery 49 +/- 55 months after routine AVR. A group of 101 controls without morphologic progression of aortic diameters at least 6 years after AVR was utilized to identify predictors of postsurgical dissection. Multivariate analysis identified aortic regurgitation (P<0.002) and fragility (P<0.001) or thinning of the aortic wall (P<0.007) at the AVR as predictors associated with a 14%, 22% and 7% probability of late aortic dissection, respectively. Duration of aortic clamping, types of valve prostheses, concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting and mean ascending aortic diameters of 43 +/- 10mm at AVR failed to predict late dissection. A separate analysis of 29 nondissecting aneurysms of the ascending aorta developing 104 +/- 64 months after routine AVR revealed younger age at the AVR (P<0.003) and congenitally bicuspid aortic valves (P<0.03) as predictors of late aneurysm formation. Aortic regurgitation and fragility or thinning of the aortic wall have the potential to predict late aortic dissection in patients with only moderate aortic dilation. Assessment of these predictors permits intraoperative stratification of aortic risk and may guide decisions for prophylactic surgery of the aortic root.
