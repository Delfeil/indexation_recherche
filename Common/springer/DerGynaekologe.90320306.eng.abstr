Although carcinoma screening is now widely available, cervical carcinoma is still the fourth most common tumour among women in the USA and in the western industrialized nations. There are about 14,000 new cases every year. In underdeveloped countries carcinoma of the cervix is widespread and often the most frequent tumour[18]. Besides primarily surgical treatment radiotherapy is the main curative treatment modality, the 5-year survival rates after therapy being around 90% for stage I disease and 7% for stage IV (FIGO Annual Report). It therefore seems desirable to look for therapeutic concepts, with the aim of improving the present results further by means of new combinations of irradiation with a systemic therapy.
