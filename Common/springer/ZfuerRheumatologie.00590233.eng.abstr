 Background and aim of the study: For many years the treatment of spondylitis and spondylodiscitis has been discussed controversially. The aim of this study is to report on objective and subjective mid-term results of therapy of spondylitis and to present a differentiated concept of treatment.    Methods: Between 1988 and 1996, 58 patients were treated with spondylitis or spondylodiscitis. Nine of these patients had to be operated. A biopsy was taken in all of the cases. According to the antibiogram optained by the biopsy, antibiotics were applied intravenously. The patients were immobilized by a plaster bed for at least 6 weeks and were then treated by a spinal orthosis for another 3 months. Patients were reexamined clinically and radiographically and by a questionnaire (including Roland-Morris score), after 8 years on average.    Results: Patients were diagnosed correctly 4 months after the begin of the disease. Spondylitis was predominantly localized in the lumbar spine. A positive bacteriological culture was derived from one third of the biopsies; none of them was a specific culture. C-reactive protein was revealed as appropriate for diagnosis and follow-up of spondylitis. In 84% of the patients a total or partial bony fusion was demonstrated radiographically. Questionnaire assessment revealed a significant decrease of the Roland-Morris score (17.8-7.4) and a significant relief of pain (8.9-2.5).    Conclusions: We recommend surgical treatment on patients with major vertebral body destruction, epidural abscess and progressive neurological impairment. These indications for operation can be prevented by a rapid diagnosis, so that spondylitis can be successfully treated by consequent immobilization in a plaster bed and approppriate antibiotics.
