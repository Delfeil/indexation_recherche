An absolute requirement for acquiring a driving license according to German law consists in the suitability for driving a motor vehicle. The "driving license decree" defines these requirements; in case of doubt the administrative authority may demand a medical certificate. According to law (enactment: 1.1.99) these medical certificates must be refunded by either appropriate medical specialists, company doctors or public health officers. The criterions for appraisal are set down in the guidelines for driving ability which are edited by the advisory board for traffic medicine; a new edition will be published soon. Concerning otorhinolaryngology hearing impairment and dizziness are the most relevant diseases. Bilateral deafness is no general exception for confering a driving license for the classes A and B; for classes C and DE hearing loss, established from the pure tone audiogram must not exceed 60%; an exceptional case is a three year demonstration of reliability in class B. Permanent dizziness or vertigo attacks are in most cases incompatible with confering driving licenses. The most important issue for medical appraisal is to determine the amount of compensation of the impaired sense organ. Therefore in cases of multiple disabilities more stringent criterions must be established.
