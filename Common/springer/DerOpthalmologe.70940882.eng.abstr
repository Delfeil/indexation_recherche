Background: Clinical studies have demonstrated the relevance of focal RPE proliferations in early AMD as risk factors for visual loss caused by late AMD. Angiographically these focal RPE proliferations are characterized as small hypofluorescent spots with hyperfluorescent rim without leakage. Corresponding to histological and experimental studies they can be interpreted as small areas of occult choroidal neovascularizations covered by proliferated RPE cells. The characterization of the long-term prognosis of these lesions was the aim of the present study.
