 A total of 186 consecutive patients underwent open tension-free inguinal hernia repair, either on one or both sides. Overall, 220 hernias were repaired under local anesthesia conditions after intraoperatively classifying the size of the hernia. The follow-up investigation took place as planned in 165 hernias. The mean follow-up time was 15.5 months, with a range from 6.6 to 30.8 months, and the follow-up rate was 75.0 %. During this first follow-up it was especially interesting to read the patients, self-assessment concerning their physical restrictions during the first month after the operation. Furthermore, we were interested in learing about the objective and subjective operation-linked consequences in the patients, inguinal region. Most patients (89.7 %) were able to do sports and drive their car; 86.1 % were able to manage their usual physical activity 4 weeks after the operation. Focusing on the operation site, patients complained about chronic unpleasant effects, such as mild pain (21.2 %), local hypoesthesia (12.1 %), weather-dependent changes in sensitivity (7.2 %), moderate pain (3.6 %), inguinal syndrome (1.8 %) and hyperesthesia (1.2 %). Persistent swelling in the parainguinal region was found in 1.8 % of the patients and only one recurrence was found (0.6 %). In the analysis we found that mild chronic pain was not related to the time period after the operation and the age or sex of the patient, but there was a correlation with the size of the hernia. Patients with small hernias significantly more often experienced chronic pain than patients with bigger hernias. These results suggest that open tension-free inguinal hernia repair according to Lichtenstein appears to be overtreatment in patients with small inguinal hernias.
