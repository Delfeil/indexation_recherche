Liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; stages I-IV) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti-S 100 protein and KiMlp antibodies. We confirm previous findings that, in early PBC, S 100 protein-positive DCs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia. However, the present study disclosed that S 100 protein- and KiMlp-positive DCs regularly occur in piecemeal necroses (PMNs) developing in PBC-associated chronic hepatitis. DCs in PMNs were observed in all PBC stages, but were most prominent in late-stage PBC. These findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in PBC may not be limited to bile ducts, but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma, producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity.
