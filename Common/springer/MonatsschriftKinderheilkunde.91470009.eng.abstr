Commonly used regiments for gut decontamination after oral ingestion of toxic substances are induced emesis, gastric lavage and activated charcoal. It was not until recently that the effectiveness of these procedures was studied systematically. The results of these studies are presented and the side effects and complications of the different procedures are discussed. Together with the German poison control centers, guidelines for gut decontamination in pediatric patients were developed, based on the official recommendations of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT).
