The use of pulse oximetry during pre-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively investigated in 23 cases. The question was whether the measurement of oxygen saturation during pre-clinical resuscitation is useful and what conclusions are possible. We were able to obtain confidential data for oxygen saturation in 82.6% (n = 19) of cases. Our results show that pulse oximetry could be used as a means of quality control during resuscitation. It is a useful part of pre-hospital monitoring and should be used during resuscitation as early as possible.
