Abstract.  Enchondromas are the most common bone tumors of the hand. In a retrospective study, medical records and radiographs of 112 patients were reviewed. These patients were operated on between January 1973 and June 1997. After extirpation of the tumor, the defect was preferably treated with bone grafting in 102 patients. A malignant transformation (chondrosarcoma) was diagnosed in 2 patients. Follow-up examination of 92 patients with a mean follow-up of 1.6 years (range: 7 months to 14 years) yielded excellent or good results in 76 patients (82.6 %), according to the evaluation scheme of Wilhelm and Feldmeier. Four recurrences were probably related to an incomplete resection of the tumor. The authors conclude that enchondromas of the hand should be treated surgically to prove the diagnosis and to prevent a pathologic fracture.
