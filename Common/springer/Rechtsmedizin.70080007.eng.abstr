 The present basic research study deals with the question of voluntary decision in suicide. Based upon a cybernetic model it is attempted to show how the process of decision leading to suicide proceeds - during different time periods - in five stages. Whereas there are still degrees of freedom in the decisional stages of consideration, ambivalence and decision, from the moment of decision the suicidal course of action proceeds in a determined manner towards suicide. For the practical expert opinion on voluntary decision in suicide, five criteria are specified to emphasize the importance of a qualitative diagnosis. If the expert opinion on suicide is hampered by a considerable lack of information, the question of voluntary decision cannot be determined. If this group in particular contains "voluntary deaths" remains unanswered. The more reliable the diagnostic method, the higher the probability that the suicidal person suffered from a psychobiological disturbance at the moment of suicide.
