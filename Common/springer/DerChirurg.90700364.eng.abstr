 Prophylactic surgery on the musculoskeletal system has a wide range of indications, for example posttraumatic or non-traumatic malalignment of the lower extremities, joint instabilities or bony lesions with the risk of fracture and secondary malignant change. The goals of treatment include pain relief, improved function and redistribution of the physiological mechanical forces. Clinical experience over the past three decades has defined the current role of realignment of the lower limbs. Recent technological advances have further improved the surgical ability to assess and select patients who are candidates for realignment osteotomy or joint stabilization.
