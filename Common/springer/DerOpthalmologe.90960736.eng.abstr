There is no generally accepted therapy for patients with central retinal vein occlusion. Only few of the therapeutic strategies in use demonstrated their effectiveness in studies with large patient populations, others have the disadvantage of unacceptable side effects. The aim of the immediate therapy is the improvement of blood perfusion. Prognostically relevant factors like the activity of components of the blood coagulation system, rheology characteristics and predisposing vascular disease risk factors have to be considered. A risk adapted management includes the immediate anticoagulation with heparin. Haemodilution, fibrinolytic therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy represent other therapeutic strategies. The efficacy of new promising therapies has to be thoroughly evaluated in studies with large stratified patient populations.
