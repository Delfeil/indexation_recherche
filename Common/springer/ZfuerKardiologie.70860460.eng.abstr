  All 181 patients with malignant arrhythmias who have been provided with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) at the University Clinics of Muenster during the last 3 years, were investigated by a clinical questionnaire on quality of life (QOL). 132 patients answered and could be included in the study (response rate 73%). The mean age of the patients was 55  +/-  11.8 years, 73 % males, 60% had already retired. In the general view 51% of the patients reported fair to excellent quality of life, while 24% gave a negative description of their QOL. 26% of the patients suffered from side-effects of the treatment, primarily complaints and ICD-related disturbances. "Unrest" was the predominant psychological complaint (64 % of the patients), followed by rumification, shortness of breath, weakness and sleep disturbances. Somatic function areas primarily affected (more than half of the patients complaining about these). The "Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB)" showed reduced well-being in 61% of the patients. Comparing with the literature and regarding the PGWB-scales well-being, anxiety, and depression no significant differences could be found in comparison with other cardiologic samples after bypass-surgery or valve replacement. The results indicate the newed of individual counseling and offers of psychosocial support for this highly strained group to reduce anxiety and to improve the quality of life in order to help the patient to gain greater overall benefit from the new ICD-therapy.
