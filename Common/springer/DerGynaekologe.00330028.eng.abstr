It is known that phyto-oestrogens have an influence on chronic diseases such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, and hormone-dependent cancers (breast, prostate, uterus). Phyto-oestrogens also have a direct effect on the following processes: antiangiogenesis, antioxidative effects, decrease in serums levels of cholesterol, antitumoral effects on breast carcinoma cell lines, protection against osteoporosis, lengthening of the menstrual cycle, suppression of gonadotropins in the middle of the cycle and reduction of free and active oestrogen in the plasma. The effect of phyto-oestrogenes is lower thanthat of human oestrogens but high concentrations of phyto-oestrogens can have an effect on the endocrine system by inhibition of FSH and LH secretion and stimulation of SHBG. It was shown that soy bean-rich food significantly decreased the risk of getting breast cancer . Phyto-oestrogens may protect elderly women against osteoporosis. The following mechanisms are discussed: inhibition of TNFa, stimulation of lymphopoiesis, suppression of the osteoclast activity, stimulation of TGFb production in osteoclasts, stimulation of the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts and increase in the mineralization in bone. A positive effect in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases by phyto-oestrogens is probably related to the secretion and digestion of fats.
