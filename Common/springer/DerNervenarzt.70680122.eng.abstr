We studied the effects of stroke unit care in an acute Neurology department on the outcome and the length of hospital stay in acute stroke patients. After an emergency evaluation on admission including CCT, ultrasound studies and ECG the patients were treated on a specialist stroke unit for an average 3.9 days. For 48  +/-  24 h monitoring of blood pressure, ECG, pO2 and transcranial Doppler sonography was instituted. Stroke unit treatment reduced the length of hospital stay from an average 15.8 days in the time period before institution of the stroke unit to 12.9 days. This effect was especially marked in patients with acute occlusion of major intracranial arteries (before stroke unit treatment: n = 33; hospital stay 22.5 days; after stroke unit treatment: n = 54; hospital stay 13.9 days). Clinical deterioration in acute ischemic stroke was related to reduction of cerebral blood flow velocities due to blood pressure changes or space occupying effects. Monitoring on the stroke unit allowed immediate treatment of systemic hypotension, cerebral edema or cardiac arrhytmias. Transcranial Doppler sonography revealed HITS in 6/55 acute stroke patients without new clinical symptoms. Monitoring on the stroke unit improved the specific care for acute stroke patients. The length of hospital stay was reduced after stroke unit care.
