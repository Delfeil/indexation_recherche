 From August 1992 to March 1997, 66 patients with 71 displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures were prospectively examined after an operative treatment using an extended lateral approach and the ASIF calcaneal plate followed by early functional postoperative treatment (mean follow-up 25 months, retrieval rate 96 %). To classify the type of fracture and to verify the results of reduction and of retention CT scans in the coronal and transverse plane were performed pre- and postoperatively and on the day of assessment. The Zwipp Score was used for clinical evaluation. After fractures with 5 to 8 points according to the calcaneal fracture scale, 97 % of the patients had an anatomical or near anatomical reduction of the posterior facet and the clinical outcome in 82 % of the patients was graded as good or excellent. In 70 % of patients with a fracture rated 9 to 10 points a good reduction was demonstrated and clinically there were 67 % good or excellent results. But in the fractures with 11 to 12 points, despite 40 % good reductions, the clinical outcome was graded as good in 10 % of the patients only. However, if the postoperative displacement of the posterior facet was more than 2 mm no patient had a good result independent of the type of fracture. Due to restoration of the geometry of the most comminuted fracture types and the immediate partial weight bearing secondary soft tissue problems could be minimized without any loss of articular reduction. Anatomical reduction and stable internal fixation together with adequate physical therapy are apparently preconditions but not a guarantee for a good clinical result after displaced calcaneal fractures.
