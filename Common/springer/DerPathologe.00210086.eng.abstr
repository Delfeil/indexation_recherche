Intravascular lymphomatosis (IVL) is a rare lymphoproliferative disease characterized by intravascular growth of lymphoma cells in small vessels. Most frequently, its first manifestations occur in the central nervous system or skin. Based on autoptical findings in a 68-year-old-man with IVL, the pathological morphology in the central nervous system is compared to the course of neurological symptoms. The disease could not be diagnosed during his lifetime. The spectrum of neurological deficits can be explained histopathologically by occlusive intravascular aggregations of lymphomatous cells in small vessels of the spinal leptomeninges and nerve roots causing perfusion deficits and areas of ischemic necrosis of up to 4 mm in diameter in the medulla. Aggregations of lymphoma cells in the vessels of other organs are also found, but did not result in clinical symptoms. In reference to the present case, a survey of other literature reports on IVL with neurological and psychiatric manifestations is given. In patients with this condition, even an invasive biopsy has to be considered in order to make the correct diagnosis at an early clinical stage.
