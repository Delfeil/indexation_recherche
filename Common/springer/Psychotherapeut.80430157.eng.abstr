Severe personality disorders manifest themselves primarily in social relations; they are interaction disorders. The patients express their specific pathology not in symbolic language, but enact it in interaction. In- patient psychotherapy offers the chance to understand and to treat personality disorders simultaneously along an intrapsychic vertical and an interactive horizontal dimension. For this purpose the psychotherapeutic hospital should be conceptualized as social space, demarcated from outer reality by  a frame that thus constitutes a therapeutic space as a space of interactive experience. The significance of interactive experiences in severe personality disorders might be due to the condition that they are stored up not as symbolic memories but as action memories.
