The aim of this study was to compare the outcome and clinical course of multiple trauma patients with accidental or intentional (suicide related) fall from heights > 4 m. 211 patients with an injury severity score (ISS) > 17 were assigned to the following groups: I: intentional fall, n = 94; A: accidental fall, n = 117) and ISS (I: 28  +/-  1; A: 30  +/-  1), ventilation time (I: 16  +/-  2; A: 15  +/-  1) were not different. Significant differences were found in sex (m/f: I: 56/44; A: 73/27 %), fractures of lumbarspine (I: 34; A: 15 %), pelvis (I: 51; A: 38 %), lower leg (I: 47; A: 20 %), pilon (I: 15; A: 5 %), and os calcis (I: 17; A: 9 %). Liver lacerations occured more often after intentional fall (I: 16; A: 6 %). Single or multiple organ failure (MOF) was diagnosed significantly more often in group A (I: 1; A: 8 %). Main cause of death in both groups was single or multiple organ failure (MOF: I: 47; A: 69 %) or related to brain-injuries (I: 35; A: 19 %). Prognosis and rehabilitation of multiple trauma patients after intentional fall is related to brain-injuries, spine-fractures and the functional outcome of the injured lower leg. Prognosis of patients after accidental fall is related to the development of MOF during the ICU-course.
