Background. In cases of total canalicular occlusion or the total absence of the lacrimal apparatus the functional restoration requires the repair of a newly created lacrimal system. The intraoperatively reestablisted lacrimal drainage from the conjunctival sac will be maintained by a plastic tube. Beside other criteria the influence of the used inserted materials polyethylene or silicone should be evaluated.
