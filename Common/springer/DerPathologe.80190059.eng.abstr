Prostate cancer has become the most common cancer in males in Western countries. In the United States 317000 men were newly diagnosed with this disease in 1996. Screening efforts will identify increasing numbers of men who will be scheduled for prostate biopsy. Since the progression of prostate cancer varies widely from rapid tumor growth with early distant metastases to slow growth with good prognosis, it is of utmost importance that prognostic parameters be identified which allow the course of the disease to be predicted. Thus, the correct pathohistological staging, the evaluation of different grading systems, and the biological impact of positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy requires collaboration between urologists and pathologists.
