 In the last 10years the use of mechanical stapling devices in endoscopic surgery have found widespread application and acceptance. Even one of the most common surgical operations, the appendectomy, is done regularly laparoscopically. Therefore, utilization of endostaples is commonplace and often results in the spillage of fired staples beyond the margin tissue. We report the case of a 23-year-old patient who developed the clinical signs of bowel obstruction 2 weeks after laparoscopical appendectomy. An exploratory laparotomy was subsequently performed. At the time of exploration, a single band was identified that draped over the ilium central affixed to a staple. The staple was removed and the obstruction relieved without bowel resection. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery. We believe that the cause of this mechanical bowel obstruction was a loose staple.
