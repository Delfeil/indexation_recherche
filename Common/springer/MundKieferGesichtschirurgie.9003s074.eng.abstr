The masticatory rehabilitation of patients is dependent on the quality and volume of residual jaw bone. Loss of volume caused by tumor-related mandibular ridge resection or age-related atrophies may cause considerable problems. Reconstructive methods using free iliac bone, external tabula, or sandwich plasties are only a few examples of the common surgical treatment modalities. Doing without bone grafts, alveolar ridge augmentation by means of distraction osteogenesis might become a value method to improve the denture-bearing area. A new distraction implant system is shown and its first clinical use reported. Two distraction implants were inserted after an anterior segmental osteotomy. The alveolar ridge was then elevated  1 mm each day until the required augmentation of about 8 mm was achieved. After a latency period for pre-ossification of the callus, the distraction implants were replaced by the endosseous implants. The implant system and the surgical technique are shown, and the results are discussed. We believe that the implant distraction procedure will make useful contribution to the management of masticatory rehabilitation.
