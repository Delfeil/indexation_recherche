Histologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural results of a rhinoscleroma diagnosed bioptically on a 38 aged man are demonstrated. The characteristic light microscopic sign is a plasmocytic inflammatory infiltrate with dense packed foamy transformed macrophages (Mikulicz cells) ultrastructurally containing diplobacilli (Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, gram negative agent of the lesion). The lesion has to be differentiated as of other inflammatory diseases as of plasmocytoma. A local application of acriflavin solution 2% was of therapeutical benefit.
