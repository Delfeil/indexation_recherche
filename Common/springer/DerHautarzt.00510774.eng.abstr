E. Grosshans and L. Marot first described blaschkitis in 1990 as a linear inflammatory dermatitis following lines of Blaschko in an adult patient. We report another case which occurred in a 38-year-old woman who developed an extensive, linear, erythematosquamous dermatitis involving the face, all limbs and the trunk. The patient's serum tested positive for antinuclear antibodies at a dilution of 1:640. The lesions regressed spontaneously within 4 weeks. Blaschkitis is a distinct entity which corresponds neither to a known inflammatory dermatitis in the lines of Blaschko nor to an hamartoma nor to an X-linked disease. Cutaneous antigenic mosaicism, the expression of which might be induced by a viral infection, could trigger this localized inflammatory T-cell response. This hypothesis relates blaschkitis to other cutaneous autoimmune diseases, as does the presence of antinuclear antibodies. We therefore suggest renaming this type of inflammatory dermatitis Grosshans-Marot disease in honour to the dermatologists who first described the entity.
