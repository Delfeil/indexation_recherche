We report on a case of a lumbar epidural abscess with staphylococcus aureus following a catheter epidural anaesthesia in a previously healthy and not immunesuppressed 34-year-old female. The indication for the epidural anaesthesia was mobilization of the right knee following arthrotomy due to chronic synovitis. On postoperative day 7 the patient experienced lumbar pain, headache and meningism. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an epidural abscess at the height of the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae. A rightsided intralaminar fenestration with debridement and drainage of the abscess was carried out immediately after confirmation of the diagnosis.
