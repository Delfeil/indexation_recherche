 State-of-the-art dual chamber pacing systems feature special functions such as automatic mode switching (AMS). The mode switch is based on different algorithms depending on the manufacturer. This report describes the Pacesetter Trilogy DR+ pacemaker mode switch algorithm and the mode switching activating indications by means of examples.  With the Pacesetter Trilogy DR+ pacemaker, mode switch does not occur from one beat to to the next but requires several cycles. The switching from the DDD(R) to the DDI(R) mode occurs when the preset atrial tachycardia detection rate (ADTR) is exceeded. A prerequisite for the mode switching is the activation of a monitoring function in the pacemaker that allows the detection of atrial activity even within the post-ventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP). Especially patients with stable atrial flutter require a short PVARP and a low upper rate for the monitoring function to be activated. Depending on the ADTR setting or the difference betweeen maximum tracking rate and ADTR, a slow or a fast mode switch can be reached. The smaller the difference - the minimum is 20/min the faster the mode switch and vice versa. The switch-back to the atrial tracking mode, from DDI(R) to DDD(R), occurs when the atrial tachycardia rate drops below the programmed maximum tracking rate. The higher the maximum tracking rate, the faster the switch-back. It is especially important to keep this in mind for patients with atrial fibrillation and intermittent atrial undersensing, since due to the lack of intermittent atrial sensing, the switch-back can occur too fast or provoke mode oscillation.  The event and mode switch histrogram gives information on the number of mode switches, the duration of each mode switch, and the highest atrial rate attained. Therefore, not only the switch function ca be checked but also the further development of the atrial arrhythmia and the result of an antiarrhythmic therapy.  A prerequisite for the adequate function of the mode switch is the correct sensing of atrial signals during the tachyarrhythmia. The intraoperative P-wave measurement does not allow a prediction on the tachyarrhythmic atrial signal (atrial fibrillation). Thus, it is desirable to program a vey high (maximum) atrial sensitivity which in turn requires the use of bipolar leads.  Potential mode switch problems such as inadequate, false or no activation of the mode switch function, and mode oscillation can be minimized through correct pacemaker programming. It has to be determined which patient requires a mode switch or will profit from this feature and which patient will be better off with a DDI(R) mode right from the start because it is still true: the more algorithms, the more complex the pacemaker ECG assessment, and the longer the patient follow-up.
