 The classical surgical approach for the treatment of Zenker's diverticulum consists of diverticulectomy and cervical myotomy. In very small diverticula myotomy alone is sufficient. The complication rate of the procedure is tolerable. Long-term functional results are good in as much as 90 % and more. Despite the increasing importance of alternative approaches, the conventional extraluminal surgical operation for Zenker's diverticulum will remain the treatment of choice in stage I-III cases.
