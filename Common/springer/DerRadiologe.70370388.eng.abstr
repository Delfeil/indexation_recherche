Pulmonary hypertension is a severe disorder of the pulmonary circulation and occurs in a variety of vascular and parenchymal lung diseases. It leads to volume and/or pressure overload of the right ventricle and finally to right heart failure. Pulmonary vascular diseases such as chronic pulmonary embolism cause a drastic increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, which results in extremely high pulmonary artery pressures that can even reach systemic levels. On the other hand, moderate pulmonary hypertension can also occur in chronic obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. For a long time, the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale was based upon findings in echocardiography and right heart catheterization. Today modern imaging techniques allow the radiologist to assess right ventricular and pulmonary artery morphology and function. The application of spiral CT, electron-beam CT and MRT permits the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and also the evaluation and follow-up of underlying vascular or parenchymal lung disorders. In addition, quantification of right ventricular function and calculation of pulmonary hemodynamic parameters are possible.
