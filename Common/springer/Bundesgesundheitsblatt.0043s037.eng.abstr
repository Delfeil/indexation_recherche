Recently there has been an increase in the prevalent HIV infected population in Germany because of declines in progression to AIDS and death while the number of newly infected patients remains constant.This increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention.  Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an HIV infected person by a route through which transmission is possible, is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases. Economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether PEP should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for PEP should be used for other HIV prevention or treatment interventions.The value of PEP depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention. In this paper, we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of PEP in different population subgroups, including those occupationally exposed, those exposed through unprotected sex, and those exposed through IV drug use. The cost-effectiveness of PEP is also compared to literature estimates of the cost-effectiveness of other prevention activities.
