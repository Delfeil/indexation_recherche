Background: Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 is a rare autosomal dominant inherited tumor disorder, which is subclassified into MEN type 2a, MEN type 2b and FMTC (familial medullary thyroid carcinoma). Tumor development in MEN type 2 is caused by activating mutations of the RET-protooncogene, located on chromosome 10. Apart from medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is the only disease manifestation in FMTC, affected individuals may also suffer from phaeochromocytoma in MEN type 2a and 2b and primary hyperparathyroidism in type 2a. Characteristical features for MEN type 2b, which is often caused by de-novo mutations, are mucosal neurinomas and a marfanoid physical appearance.
