Disturbances of small afferent nerve fibres play an important role in painful neuropathies. Quantitative thermotest offers a possibility to quantify these disturbances that can not be detected by conventional electrophysiology. It is a psychophysical method to investigate thermal and nociceptive afferents by determinating thermal thresholds. Former experiences have shown that quantitative thermotest can be a helpful tool not only in daily routine but also for research work concerning pathophysiological mechanisms of neuropathy. Therefore a multicentric approach to investigate rare painful neuropathies seems to be useful.
