Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia. Diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient's age have been proven to be important determinants. The question of whether post-operative recumbency can reduce the risk of PDPH has not been answered uniformly. And besides, some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures, for example, as to clear definition and exact documentation of post-operative immobilization. Furthermore, fine-gauge needles (26G or more) have not been investigated yet. The first aim of our study was therefore to examine the role of recumbency in the prevention of PDPH under controlled conditions using thin needles. Secondly, we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified, atraumatic tip (Whitacre and Atraucan) by comparing them to Quincke needles of identical diameter. Most of the former investigators compared Quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on PDPH.
