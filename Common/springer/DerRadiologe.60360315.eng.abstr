Osteoporosis represents one of the most common disorders in Germany. Because of the general aging of the population and due to several secular trends (less exercise, nutritional deficits, higher standard of living) the prevalence of osteoporosis will increase substantially. Therefore, it is important to develop preventive strategies and analyze them according to both medical and economical criteria. During the last couple of years substantial progress has been made both in the area of diagnostic approaches as well as treatment modalities. Thus, from a medical point of view important conditions for a positive assessment of the cost-benefit-ratio of diagnostic approches in osteoporosis are now fulfilled. Currently, a strategy for selective screening of well-defined high risk groups appears to be most appropriate. These include 1. women with subnormal hormonal status provided that other risk factors are present, 2. patients with low-trauma fractures, 3. patients under prolonged steroid therapy, and 4. patients with secondary osteoporosis due to other causes. International studies have demonstrated that even more far-reaching preventive strategies can be conceived that could be both medically and economically effective. Currently, however, data for a detailed cost-benefit-analysis are lacking or based on outdated diagnostic equipment or treatment agents. New Studies on this topic are critically needed to evaluate preventive strategies, specifically for Germany.
