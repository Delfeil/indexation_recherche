Among 946 patients with nevus spilus we observed 5 patients (3 women and 2 men) with transformations on it - 2 cases with malignant melanoma and 3 cases with spitz-nevus. Histologically the nevus spilus is a superficial variant on congenital pigmented nevus missing corial parts. Because of the risk of transformation a regular skin examination is advisable, a prophylactical excision of nevi spili as used in congenital pigmented nevi should be discussed.
