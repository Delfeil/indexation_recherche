Echocardiography is a noninvasive method for cardiac evaluation. A review of the current literature shows that the routine use of echocardiography for assessing perioperative cardiac risk in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery can not be supported. Only patients with suspected relevant heart valve diseases, acute heart failure, cardiomyopathy or condition after heart or heart-lung transplantation may benefit from preoperative echocardiography. In patients with suspected or proven coronary artery disease stress echocardiography offers the most relevant additional information for the anaesthesiologist. However, because of the high financial and personal implications it should be reserved to those patients who are not able to perform a normal stress test. Besides in patients in whom transthoracic echocardiography doesn't offer sufficient information or is not possible transesophageal echocardiography plays only a minor role in preoperative cardiac evaluation.
