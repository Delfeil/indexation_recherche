  Our knowledge on the molecular genetics of inherited cardiac arrhythmias is very recent in comparison to the advances of genetics achieved in other inherited cardiac disorders. This is related to the high mortality and early disease onset of these arrhythmias resulting in mostly small nucleus families. Thus, traditional genetic linkage studies that are based on the genetic information obtained from large multi-generation families were made difficult.
