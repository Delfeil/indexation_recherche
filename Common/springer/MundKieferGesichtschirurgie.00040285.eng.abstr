Problem. Anterior dislocation of the articular disk of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) found by MRI tomography often presents a problem. It may persist in MRI despite improvement of articular symptoms and even be found in healthy persons free of any symptoms. Can this be explained by the similarity in structure of the anterior connective tissue of the disk and capsule and their pathological changes? Is a second coronal plane required for MRI investigation?
