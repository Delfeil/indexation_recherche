 Dissections of peripheral arteries affect predominantly male, hypertonic patients from the age of 60, characteristically those with a cystic medianecrosis as a basic disease. In contrast, dissecting aneurysms of intracranial arteries are extremely rare. Here, younger patients with or without trauma in their past history are in the vast majority. We present a case of traumatic dissection of the middle cerebral artery in a 7-year-old girl and discuss the pathogenesis, symptoms and morphological findings with respect to cases described in the literature.
