The "knee school" concept combines guidelines for knee-friendly behavior in everyday conditions and a comprehensive program of muscle strengthening exercises that gonarthrosis patients can perform at home. Groups of patients are instructed on the basics of relevant anatomy, the development of arthrosis, and knee-friendly conduct. They train easy-to-grasp patterns of movement that help them to  improve coordination and relieve their knee joints of unphysiological strain. A prospective randomized study proved the "knee school" concept to be successful in treating gonarthrosis after arthroscopy.
