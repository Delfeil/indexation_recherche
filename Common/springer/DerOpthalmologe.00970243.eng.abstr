Background: In addition to deposition of debris between the plasma and basal membrane of the RPE, different types of early and late AMD-like drusen, choroidal neovascularization and pigment epithelial detachments are characterized by splitting of Bruch's membrane between the basement membrane of the RPE and the inner collagenous layer. Because these layers are normally attached by adhesion molecules, the possible age-related regression of these adhesion molecules in this structure was examined.
