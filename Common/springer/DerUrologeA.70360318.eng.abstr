Nitric oxide (NO) is suggested as an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes. In the present study we tried to determine histochemically and immunohistochemically the localization and distribution of the constitutive NO-synthase isoforms (bNOS and eNOS) of 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostates. Differentiated nitrinergic innervation was shown for the prostate glands, firbromuscular stroma and blood vessels by NADPH-diaphorase staining and immunohistochemically with specific NOS antibodies. In the specimens with benign prostatic hyperplasia nitrinergic innervation seems to be distinctly reduced. The vascular distribution of NOS provides evidence for segmental differentiation of NO-mediated vascular regulation. The NADPH-diaphorase reaction was not confirmed immunohistochemically by the specific NOS antibody in the glandular epithelium. The distribution of NO synthase shows the importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, blood flow and secretory function in the normal and hyperplastic human prostate.
