In the medical care of a professional dance group we were often confronted with problems of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP I). A painful, limited dorsiflexion of the great toe makes classical ballet performance virtually impossible. After anatomical cadaver studies we introduced arthroscopy of MTP I at the Orthopaedic Department of the Academic Medical Centre of the University of Amsterdam in 1990. By 1992 arthroscopic procedures had been performed in 23 patients. The indications for the operations were: (1) hallux rigidus (n = 4), (2) impingement syndrome (painful joint with slightly limited dorsiflexion; n = 11), (3) osteochondrosis dissecans/loose bodies (n = 3), and (4) pathological conditions in sesamoid bone (n = 5). The result of this prospective study were analysed in respect of function, pain, swelling, ability to work and sport performance. The best results of arthroscopic surgery were seen in patients with impingement syndromes and in osteochondrosis dissecans or loose bodies. The results of arthroscopic surgery of the hallux rigidus and the sesamoid bone pathology were less favourable. The results of our new arthroscopic procedure on MTP I are encouraging. Arthroscopy of the MTP I can be advised for suitable indications.
