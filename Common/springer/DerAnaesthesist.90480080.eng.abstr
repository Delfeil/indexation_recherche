Background: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is still one of the major problems in strabismus surgery, especially in children. In recent years many studies have been published, suggesting that choosing propofol as the anaesthetic agent may help to reduce the high incidence of PONV in children undergoing strabismus surgery. Experience with remifentanil in children is still very limited and little is known, whether propofol in combination with this new short acting opioid is also superior regarding PONV in squint surgery compared to sevoflurane/N2O. Additionally, little is known, whether the type of operation or the muscle which is operated on has any influence with respect to PONV.
