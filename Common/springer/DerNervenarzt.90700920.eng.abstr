Chemonucleolysis is a debated therapeutic method for herniated lumbar disc. We report a patient who suffered a sequence of characteristic sequels cumulating in late-onset myelopathy with persistent spastic paraplegia, sensory loss below T8 and bladder incontinence. Complications of chemonucleolysis are less frequent as compared to herniated disc surgery, but may cause severe impediment. Serious complications are anaphylactic shock, intracranial or spinal hemorrhage and transverse myelitis. This has to be taken into account for indication and patient information.
