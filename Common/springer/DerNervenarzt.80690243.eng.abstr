In most factor analytical studies of schizophrenic symptomatology a three-factor solution was found. The aim of this study was to investigate symptomatological dimensions in old age and to clarify whether the dimensions correlate differently with neuropsychological and motor parameters. A total of 131 DSM-III-R schizophrenics (mean age 68 years) were assessed using SANS, SAPS, a neuropsychological test battery and motor scales. A factor analysis yielded three dimensions (negative, desorganized, paranoid), two of which (negative, disorganized) showed different correlations with neuropsychological and motor phenomena. Thus, three symptomatological dimensions could also be demonstrated in a chronic, old-age schizophrenic sample. The pathophysiological significance of the different correlations with neuropsychological and motor parameters should be clarified in neuroimaging and neuropathological studies.
