The goal of surgery using a thoracoscopic approach for the anterior reconstruction of fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine is the reduction of postoperative pain and morbidity. Fusion of the injured segment was performed by partial corporectomy and the vertebral body reconstructed using a tricortical autogenous bone graft. A plate and screw assembly was inserted to stabilize the surgical correction. This technique was used between May 1996 on May 1998 in 100 patients with 103 fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Fractures from T4 to L3 were stabilized; most fractures occurred  at the thoracolumbar junction. A monosegmental short fusion was given preference in 51 patients. A dorsoventral approach was necessary in 68 patients on account  of the fracture type. Comparing a group of 30 patients who had undergone an open procedure and a similar group treated under thoracoscopic assistance, we found a marked reduction of the postoperative need for analgesics and the duration of postoperative ventilation.
