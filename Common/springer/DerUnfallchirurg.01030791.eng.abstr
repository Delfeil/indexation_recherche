Undislocated odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x-rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability. In this aspect the classification based on Anderson and D'Alonzo takes a high risk to missunderstood the fracture stability and can results in a secondary fracture dislocation. Therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism. In this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction. Furthermore a better classification of densfractures will be recommended.
