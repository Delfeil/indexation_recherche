Subjective time-experience and objective time-estimation were examined in 20 endogenous, 20 neurotic depressives, and 15 healthy volunteers. Subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls. Objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives. There were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives. The perception of extended time normalized during treatment. The depressives' time perception, differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and - to a lesser degree - with retardation. The findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives. Amelioration of experienced time-extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of Lewinsohn.
