 We report the successful treatment of an iatrogenic AV fistula between the common iliac artery and the inferor vena cava in a 68-year-old man. This fistula developed 10 years after dorsal laminectomy surgery. A covered stent graft was successfully implanted in the common iliac artery via a transfemoral approach, occluding the fistula.
