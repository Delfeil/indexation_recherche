 The majority of cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implantations are currently performed with a non-thoracotomy approach. From November 1993 to January 1995, 46 patients underwent implantation of a PCD 7219C with an "active-can" lead configuration at our institution. While the chronic stability of the defibrillation threshold (DFT) for an epicardial lead system is well established, the results are still inconsistent for non-thoracotomy lead systems. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to compare the acute and chronic defibrillation thresholds of the ICDs implanted with an "active-can" lead system in order to assess the chronic stability of these systems.   The defibrillation energy requirements were measured at implant, prior to hospital discharge, three, six and twelve months after implantation of the defibrillator. The patient group consisted of 8 females and 38 males with a mean age of 57.2 years. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 43.8%. The most frequent underlying heart disease was coronary artery disease in 31 of 46 patients. Eight patients had idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.   In 39 of 46 patients, the defibrillation threshold could be successfully determined at all 4 time points after implantation. The mean defibrillation energy requirement at the time of implantation was 9.2 +/- 5.9 Joules (J). The subsequent mean energy requirements were 7.6 +/- 4.8 J at pre-hospital discharge, 8.6 +/- 5.7 J at the 3 month, 8.1 +/- 6.0 J at the 6 month and 8.6 +/- 5.8 J at the 12 month follow-up visits. The mean defibrillation threshold was lowest at the time of prehospital discharge, significantly lower than at the time of initial implantion (p=0.021). However, at all later time points up to one year, there was no significant difference in the DFT as compared with the time of initial implantation. Comparing the DFT at the time of implantation and the DFT at all other time points, there were no significant differences (9.23 vs. 8.56 J, p=0.291). Although there was an initial decrease in the DFT at seven to ten days, the long-term stability of the DFT up to one year remained stable in the devices with the "active-can" lead system.
