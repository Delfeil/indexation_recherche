The use of degradable implants in recent years has brought not only good results. Foreign body reactions to implantation of degradable polymers clearly curtailed the initial expectations. Bioabsorbable polymers have been used for sutures, vascular clips, and fixation implants for both intra-articular fractures and malleolar fractures. In the literature these implants are controversial. Potential benefits remain for the use of this material for interference screws if the problems of inflammation are minimal and the fixation properties are sufficient. There is no need for a second operation for removal. In one patient, 4.5 years after to implantation of an degradable interference screw (Copolymer 85/15 D,L lactide glycolide; Biologically Quiet, Instrument Makar, Inc. Mount Hope, MI 48864, USA) we took an biopsy and made histological examinations. No foreign body reaction or inflammation signs could be detected.
