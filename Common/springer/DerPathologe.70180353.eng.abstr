Meningiomas account for the most frequent primary intracranial neoplasms in adults. In 1993, the so-called atypical meningioma has additionally been introduced in the revised edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System and should characterize meningiomas with an increased propensity to recur. Since the given qualitative histological criteria apply both to the "atypical" and anaplastic meningioma, mere histological grading appears somewhat critical. Therefore, additional parameters were tested for their contribution to meningioma grading: First of all, we succeeded in defining 3 meningioma "grades" by calculating corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the morphometrically assessed Ki-67 indices of 160 meningiomas in total, the validity of which was proved by comparison with the "recurrence"-free intervals. Histologically, atypical meningiomas were distinguished by a "syncytial", poorly structured growth pattern and macronucleoli. Only occasionally, nuclear pleomorphism, necroses and mitotic figures were found. Cytogenetics revealed, in 50% of the "atypical" and anaplastic meningiomas, partial loss of the short arm of one chromosome 1 (1p-). Histochemically, we could demonstrate, that the tissue non-specific type of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), which is coded on chromosome 1p, is a convenient recurrence- and progression-associated marker enzyme for meningiomas with 1p-loss (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 of intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas). We favor to address the WHO "atypical" meningioma as meningioma of the intermediate type, since the attribute "atypical" in the context of histological diagnoses is highly susceptible to misinterpretations.
