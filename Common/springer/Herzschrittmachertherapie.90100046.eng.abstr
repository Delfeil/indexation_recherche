 An aim in present-day pacemaker therapy is to achieve a high pacing impedance, because this additionally reduces the pacing current of a pacemaker at similar pacing impulses.  The purpose of the study was to assess whether the right ventricular apex (RVA) is the position with the highest pacing impedance.  The study included 31 patients undergoing an electrophysiological study. The same catheter was placed in the RVA, at the tricuspid valve (TV), and in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Pacing impedance was measured at 5.0V pulse amplitude and 0.5ms pulse duration; additionally, the pacing threshold at 0.5ms pulse duration and R-wave amplitude was determined.  Mean impedance was 591+/-111 in the RVA, 578+/-157 at the TV, and 576+/-95 in the RVOT. Pacing threshold was 0.8+/-0.3V in all 3 positions and R-wave amplitude was 14.1+/-5.7mV (RVA), 12.4+/-5.0mV (TV), and 12.5+/-5.8V (RVOT), respectively. The highest impedance was measured in the RVA in 14, at the TV in 6 and in the RVOT in 11 patients. In 17 patients with a higher impedance outside the RVA repositioning of the catheter increased impedance by 147+/-139 (range: 11-539). In these 17 patients, repositioning of the catheter neither changed the pacing threshold (0.07+/-0.3V) nor the R-wave amplitude (1.0+/-5.6mV).  The different catheter positions in the right ventricle did not influence pacing threshold, impedance or R-wave amplitude. Fifty-five percent of the patients had the highest impedance when the catheter was placed outside the RVA which increased impedance by 147+/-139. The repositioning was not associated with pacing threshold or R-wave amplitude changes. The findings indicate that the intraoperative impedance can be modified by the lead position.
