Postpartum hemorrhage occurs in about 1 to 5% of deliveries. Uterine atony is the main cause (75-80%). Despite its association with well-established risk factors, atonic bleeding cannot be anticipated in up to 20% of cases. Therapy of postpartum hemorrhage varies depending on the cause. Conservative treatment of uterine atony is effective in about 90% of patients. Invasive management is needed in 1 to 3 of 1000 deliveries. Uterus-preserving techniques are preferable if contraindications can be excluded. In the literature, success rates of 40 to 100% have been reported for the various non-surgical (uterine tamponade, selective arterial embolization) and surgical methods (ligation of the uterine and hypogastric arteries, stepwise uterine devascularisation, B-Lynch technique, fundus compression suture). Emergency peripartum hysterectomy (total or supracervical) should be reserved for otherwise intractable postpartum hemorrhage, and is associated with a considerable maternal morbidity compared to elective caesarean hysterectomy.
