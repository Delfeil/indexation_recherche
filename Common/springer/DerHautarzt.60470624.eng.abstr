In a 7-year-old boy, ichthyosis vulgaris was treated with a 10% ointment for application over a large area of the body surface. In this way, the child received 400 g salicylic acid (0.6 g/kg body weight per day) percutaneously over a period of 4 weeks. The patient was referred to hospital by the family doctor: he was in a deep somnolent state, apparently caused by hyperventilation following wheezing, vomiting, tinnitus and vertigo. Salicylate intoxication was suspected because of metabolic acidosis, an anion gap and respiratory overcompensation. The diagnosis was confirmed by a serum salicylate level of 985 µg/ml (therapeutic level 150-300 µg/ml). Following forced diuresis and alkalization with sodium bicarbonate, haemodialysis was unnecessary. As the salicylate level declined to values within the therapeutic range, the patient started to recover conciousness, waking on the 4th day. By day 6 there were still obvious neurological deficiencies. Fecal incontinence, bilateral ptosis and intermittent diverging strabismus on the right persisted for some weeks. It was 6 months before complete neurological resolution was achieved. The pathogenesis of salicylate toxicity and the need for safer therapies for ichthyosis vulgaris are discussed.
