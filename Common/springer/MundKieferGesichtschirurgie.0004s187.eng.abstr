The clinical symptoms of odontogenic tumors are non-specific. On the roentgenographs one most often sees radiolucencies within the bone, sometimes in combination with scattered or diffuse radioopacities. Root resorptions may be another important feature. After a short historical introduction on the development of today's classification of odontogenic tumors (WHO), each individual type of neoplasm is discussed briefly. Out of this, a therapeutic regime is developed that places each of the 22 entities into one of the following four groups: malignant, locally aggressive, tumors with recurrences, and non-recurrent ones.
