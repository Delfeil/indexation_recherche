 The hand-sutured coloanal anastomosis requires adequate and atraumatic exposure of the anal canal in order to avoid sphincter damage. We evaluated a new modified anal retractor to improve exposure of the anal canal and thread handling during construction of hand-sutured coloanal anastomosis. This new device was used during all coloanal and transperineal procedures performed in 1997 in our hospital. This new device is safe and extremely comfortable for the surgeon. It speeds up the procedure and keeps sutures out of the way when completing a coloanal anastomosis.
