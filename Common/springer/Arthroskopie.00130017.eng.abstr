This article discusses the surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability. The treatment rationale includes osteotomy, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction, and posterolateral reconstruction. Exact evaluation of the osseous anatomy is mandatory to identify an eventual varus morphotype. This osseous variant in combination with posterior/posterolateral instability should be treated by an osteotomy. An additive osteotomy correcting varus and increasing the sagittal tilt of the proximal tibia is used. Patellar tendon grafts, quadriceps tendon grafts, or hamstrings can be used for posterior cruciate ligament replacement. Arthroscopic or mini-open techniques may be used for graft placement; direct posterior fixation of the graft via a posterior incision is an option for patellar tendon grafts. Bousquet's biceps plasty or Clancy's biceps tenodesis are used for posterolateral stabilization, a biceps tendon strip can also be used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction. Results of surgery are still moderate. Of the author's series with chronic posterior/posterolateral instability, 26 cases were treated with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and biceps tenodesis. Follow-up at 18 months demonstrated increased stability (mean residual posterior drawer 8 mm at 70 ° and 20 lb force) and improved knee function (33% IKDC B, 67% IKDC C). Presently, surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability should be restricted to centers devoted to this problem.
