 Preoperative planning of liver resections in patients with liver tumors is based on sonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A new three-dimensional (3D) visualization program was developed based on CT data. This visualization program was used for preoperative planning in 6 patients with liver tumors in problematic intrahepatic localizations. In 5 out of 6 patients the liver resection could be performed as preoperatively planned. The intraoperative findings agreed with the 3D visualization in all these patients. 3D Visualization of the liver allowed clear and interactive planning of liver resections and improved the preparation of complex liver resections.
