Calcifying tendinitis of the rotator cuff is a common disorder of the shoulder which affects mainly individuals between 30 and 50 years of age. The etiology is still a matter of speculation. The calcification is a reactive process actively mediated by cells in a viable environment. The deposit undergoes an evolution (precalcific stage - calcific stage with formative phase, resting period and resorption - postcalcific stage), which ultimately remodels normal tendon tissue.
