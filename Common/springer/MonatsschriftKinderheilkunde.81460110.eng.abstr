Right atrial thrombi are rare, but potentially life-threatening complications of ventriculoatrial shunts. We report on a 4.6 year old girl, presenting with signs of subacute valve malfunction; in her cerebrospinal fluid koagulase-negative staphylococcus could be cultured, and the CF protein was elevated. Bidimensional echocardiography demonstrated a large thrombus on the distal part of the shunt. The thrombus protruded into the right ventricle during diastole. The child underwent cardiotomy and thrombectomy.
