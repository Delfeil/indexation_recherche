 In a population sample of 355 unrelated caucasian individuals living in the Salzburg Region of Austria allele and genotype frequencies of the AmpFLP system YNZ22 were determined by PCR and subsequent comparison of the fragments with an allelic ladder consisting of 13 sequenced alleles. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were found (P = 0.68). A total of 13 different alleles were found and the heterozygosity was 82.8%. Determination of the power of discrimination gave a value of 95.5% and the mean paternity exclusion chance was 68.6%. In 350 meioses no mutations were found.
