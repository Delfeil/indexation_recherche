Protruding ears are the most common auricular deformities for which patients seek consultation. These deformities belong to the first degree dysplasias and result from an overdeveloped concha, an underdeveloped anthelix or a prominent lobule. Otoplastic techniques to correct these malformations are based on such surgical principles as suturing, incision, excision, scoring and burring of the auricular cartilage. By emphasizing these basic procedures the most useful techniques are described. Special importance is placed on the indications for surgery, basic principles and techniques used.
