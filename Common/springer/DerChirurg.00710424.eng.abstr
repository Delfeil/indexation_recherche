Abstract.  Introduction: Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign. Methods: We report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 12 patients with these tumors. Results: Between October 1993 and December 1998, 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection; in 12 cases (11 women, 1 man) a serous cystadenoma (10 micrcocystic, 2 oligomacrocystic) was found. Only 6 (50 %) patients had symptoms. The mean tumor size was 4.8 (2.7-10) cm. Ultrasound, CT and MRT usually could detect the mass, but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable. All tumors were resected: 4 Whipple procedures, 7 distal pancreatectomies and 1 segmental resection were performed. No patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on. Conclusions: Because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas, we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected.
