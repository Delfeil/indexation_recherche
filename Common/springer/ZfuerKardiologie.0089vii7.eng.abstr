 Being overweight (OW) was recognized very early as a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Its significance in the pathogenesis of CHD has been strengthened by observations showing that OW is responsible for the development of diabetes, hypertension and lipid disorders due to its induction of insulin resistance (IR). Its key role has been underlined further by recent studies indicating that OW causes endothelial dysfunction via elevated serum fatty acids, which initiates the molecular events that further the process of CHD. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to determine its roots. The most probable reason for its high incidence is due to the genetic outfit of most people which does not permit adequate adaptation of the cerebral cortex according to the environmental changes which have occured since the early days.
