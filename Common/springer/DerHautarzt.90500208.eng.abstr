A 76-year-old female patient developed severe manifestations of a kaposi-like acroangiodermatitis (so-called Mali's disease) due to chronic venous insufficiency of the lower extremities. The patient presented with large areas of confluent, violaceous or brown-black papules on both lower legs. Histologically, proliferation of thick-walled capillaries was seen in the upper dermis consisting of fully differentiated endothelial cells, as shown by immunohistochemistry. In contrast to true Kaposi's sarcoma, human-herpes-virus-8 DNA could not be detected by polymerase-chain-reaction in this condition. We review the diagnostic criteria used to distinguish between acroangiodermatitis, also called pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma, and the true Kaposi's sarcoma.
