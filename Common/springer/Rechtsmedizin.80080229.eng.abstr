Abstract  In hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers the inflammatory infiltration of the portal tracts in liver is assumed to correlate with serum HCV-RNA levels and might therefore be a marker for the severity of HCV-related liver disease and infectiosity. In 10 cases of drug-related deaths, positive only for HCV-antibodies, histopathology on liver was assessed using a defined index that scores exclusively liver cell damage. The proposed scoring system is easy to perform on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and routinely stained liver slides and reflects a sensitive expression of the actual degree of damage in liver parechyma. However no correlation was found between portal infiltration and liver cell damage.
