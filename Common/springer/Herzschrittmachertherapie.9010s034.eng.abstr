 Atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery. As more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases, the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again. There are some unresolved problems of this complication.  Reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature.  Usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient, self-limiting, and benign. Nevertheless, among patients affected by this arrhythmia, morbidity, mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication. In addition, postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself. Pathogenesis is multifactorial. Today, general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future. According to the clinical course, therapy has to consider ventricular rate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control. Usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time.  Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery has to be respected in order to minimize overall complication rate.
