The literature from 1990-1997 and 3 personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites. Bites of the adder (Vipera berus) are rare. Symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution, death due to adder bite is rare. The main venom effect is the development of - sometimes severe - edema, hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy, very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure. Significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2-3 h after the incident, no signs of intoxication can be found.
