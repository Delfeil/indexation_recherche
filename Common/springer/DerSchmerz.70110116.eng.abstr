A rheumatologist and a medical psychotherapist collaborate in offering periodically a cognitive behavioral treatment program for pain control for the patients of a rheumatological practice. The program consists of a biopsychosocial model of chronic pain, individualized relaxation training combining progressive muscle relaxation and some elements of autogenous training and meditation, several attention-related techniques and cognitive restructuring. From 1993 to 1995, 50 patients took part in five training courses. The compliance of the patients was satisfactory and the drop-out rate low (8%). In a post hoc interview 4 weeks later and another 2 years after the end of the training most of the patients assessed the program as useful for reduction of pain, increase of activity and enhancement of mood. Psychotherapeutic experience in group therapy or special training for non-psychotherapeutic physicians with continuous supervision is necessary in order to conduct a qualified treatment program. Within medical primary care, rheumatologists can motivate their patients towards active pain management, which can help to prepare patients for further psychotherapy in cases with psychiatric disorders and/or severe psychosocial strains.
