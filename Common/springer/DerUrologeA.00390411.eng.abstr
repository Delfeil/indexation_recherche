There are no direct associations between testosterone levels and sexual function in the aging male. A study of 169 patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions. In volunteers, in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of GnRH, no alteration in sexual reactions occurred. It is possible that other testosterone fractions are more meaningful than the total testosterone. However, all the known fractions correlate closely. The significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now. In an animal experiment, the intracavernous pressure, the density of -receptors, and the PDES activity depended on normal testosterone levels. It is not known whether different testosterone levels influence the effectiveness of treatment procedures for erectile dysfunction in humans.
