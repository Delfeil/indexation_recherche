 Background: BPD still remains a serious complication in very prematurely born infants. In order to assess the incidence and risk factors we analyzed the data of preterm infants (birth weight <= 1751 g) born between January 1985 and December 1992.  Patients and Methods: Preterm infants requiring intubation on day 1 were enrolled retrospectively. BPD was defined as need for artificial ventilation or oxygen dependency (FiO2 > 0.3) on day 28. Infants with BPD were compared with matched controls in order to identify risk factors using a logistic regression analysis.
