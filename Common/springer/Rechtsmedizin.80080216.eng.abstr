 We report a rare case of an accident during which a pedestrian was hit by a car and was thrown through the windscreen into the front seat. Apart from the high speed (100 km/h or more) the traumatic amputation of both lower legs and the resulting reduced angular momentum mainly contributed to the final position of the pedestrian in the vehicle. In addition, the low height of the person standing in front of the vehicle is deemed to have been a supporting factor for the course of the accident.
