 As a consequence of scientific advances, an increasing number of patients with advanced age, reduced myocardial performance, previous cardiac surgery, comorbidities, and emergency indications are referred for cardiac surgery. This requires risk stratification to predict "low", "moderate", and "high" operative risk. Risk factors can be divided into pre-, intra-, and postoperative patient-, structure-, and procedure-related. On the basis of this risk prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized by an individually tailored multiprofessional and interdisciplinary management.
