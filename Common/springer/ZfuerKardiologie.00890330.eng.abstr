 In acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to PTCA regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events. It is, however, uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting. We, therefore, assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary PTCA and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result (provisional stenting).
