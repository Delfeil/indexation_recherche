 During the past 7 years 45 patients have been operated upon using the Childs-Phillips method. Of those, 37 were subsequently examined for the study - 7 patients had died in the meantime. None of the deaths occurred as a direct result of transmesenteric small-bowel plication. An early recurrence of intestinal obstruction occurred in 4.4 % and a laparotomy was repeated. During the most recent examinations 86.5 % of those patients checked had (virtually) no complaints - 91.9 % based upon the Visick classification. A subtotal intestinal obstruction occurred during the period of the study in 8.1 % of cases, but could be conservatively treated. Up until the most recent examination there were still no instances of a late recurrence. Most intestinal obstruction recurrences are due to errors specific to the technique and are early recurrences. On the basis of our results, we are of the opinion that plication in the presence of existing peritonitis, as well as partial plication, is acceptable.
