Because of its central location, the elbow joint is considered the most important joint within the upper extremity from the viewpoint of function. Trauma to osseous and ligamentous structures of the proximal forearm confronts trauma surgeons and orthopedic specialists with numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Conditions following elbow trauma are often accompanied by chronic pain and diminished range of motion, leading to functional deficits of the entire arm. There is now practically no doubt that primary osteosynthesis, anatomical joint reconstruction and early onset of functional treatment are essential for a good final outcome. With our expanding knowledge of the anatomical and biomechanical condtions in the proximal lower arm in the last few decades the basic principles of therapy have also changed, and current standards of treatment for proximal forearm trauma are presented in this paper with reference to the relevant literature.
