Careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures. This is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non-unions of these carpal bones. Conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options. Out of the patients who underwent surgery from January 1993 to February 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non-union were, in addition to standard X-ray examination, examined clinically and by MRI pre- and post-operatively. Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixtion.
