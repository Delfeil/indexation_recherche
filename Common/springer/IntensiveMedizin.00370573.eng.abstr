 The use of semi-automated defibrillators by trained nonprofessional rescuers allows for enhanced success of the chain of survival after sudden cardiac death. In the setting of professional resuscitation, the effectiveness of electrical defibrillation to convert life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias into a more stable rhythm is well established. The current article describes how defribillation can also be employed by nonprofessional witnesses of sudden cardiac death and how this can be expected to increase survival. The main focus is on training of nonprofessionals, the required materials, realization of the chain of survival, scientific documentation and control, and legal aspects. In any situation with many individuals assembled, semi-automated defribillators can readily and effectively be used to treat a patient with sudden cardiac death. This can be expected to substantially improve the generally unfavorable outcome of such patients.
