This multicenter study was conducted in 1992 in the area of the city of Munich. 104 patients with severe head injury were enrolled, 80% were treated by a physician at the accident site. Rescue time was 8.2 min. 70% of patients were directly transported to a neurotrauma center, the half within the first hour after the accident. A significant problem was inadequate documentation of the findings and measures taken at the accident site. Especially, neurological information was scarce. There was no unanimous consent about the decision to intubate a patient at the scene, although this was performed more frequently in comparison to previous studies. In some cases non medical emergency personal decided to transport a severe injured patient in own responsibility. The present investigation demonstrates the high standard of preclinical resuscitation management in patients with severe head injury. Further studies are needed to define the influence of prehospital care and outcome more precisely.
