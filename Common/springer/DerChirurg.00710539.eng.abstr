Abstract.  Introduction: Vocal cord paralysis is a important complication in thyroid gland surgery. A prospective study was conducted ascertain the frequency of laryngeal nerve palsy not caused by surgical trauma. Patients and Methods: Two hundred and ten patients were investigated laryngoscopically pre- and postoperatively after short-term intubation in the course of operations far removed from thorax or neck region. We noted the inner diameter of the tube, intubation problems, the qualification of the anaesthesiologist and the positioning of the patient. Results: Preoperatively we found previously unknown unilateral laryngeal nerve palsy in 1.9 % of cases. Postoperatively there were pathological findings of vocal cords in 13 patients (6.2 %). In 10 patients a direct lesion (oedema, rubor, haematoma, granuloma) was established. Three patients (1.4 %) were found to have a movement disorder caused by a neural lesion without morphological findings, leading to restitutio ad integrum in two of three cases after 6 months. Conclusion: The frequency of intubation-related recurrent nerve palsy is 1.4 % transiently and 0.5 % permanently. The reasons are discussed. Preoperative laryngoscopic investigation of vocal cords should be carried out before intubation.
