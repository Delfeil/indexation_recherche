A 72-year-old patient received 0.1 mg morphine by the intrathecal route and 2x1.5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy. Severe respiratory depression and somnolence supervened 3.5 h later, which lasted over the next 24 h and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation. Continuous administration of >6 mg naloxone to antagonize the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect. The patient's condition was not normalized until a single dose of 0.3 mg flumazenil was administered. For the time being, especially in the case of elderly patients, we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than 0.1 mg morphine is given. Diazepines should be avoided. Respiration should be monitored for quite some time.
