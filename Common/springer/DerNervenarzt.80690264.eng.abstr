Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism due to low serum ceruloplasm, resulting in increased copper deposition, especially in the liver and basal ganglia in the brain. The pseudosclerotic type of Wilson's disease, also known as the Westphal-Strümpell form, is distinguished by positional tremor, ataxia and dysarthria as the main symptoms. We use the example of a 23-year-old patient whose neurological symptoms were preceded by a long history of a schizophrenic-like disorder. Clinical symptoms are presented. MRI, SPECT and PET images are illustrated. Therapy and outcome are discussed.
