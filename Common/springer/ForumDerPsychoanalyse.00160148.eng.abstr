 The purpose of Psy-BaDo is to serve as a useful concept for quality assurance for everybody and every form of psychotherapy and to link psychotherapy to the medical development as an "evidence based medicine". In its foundations it is aimed at "structural quality" in the sense of standard therapy and standard therapist, at "process quality" in the sense of a standard documentation of diagnostic and therapeutic measures and at "result quality", which is orientated at the medical concepts of illness, of the role of the physician and of therapy. Economy, efficiency and practicability should be assured via quality management by a central controlling institute supported by all professional groups. The criticism of the Psy-BaDo aims at its underlying reductionist scientific perceptions, at the discharge of basic psychoanalytic views, and at the integrative application of methods without any justification through the theory of therapy following the pattern of medical application of drugs. The "practical quality assurance" of the Psy-BaDo involves no clinically and scientifically necessary psychodynamic-systemic diagnostics at all, which is, however, a pre-conditon for any reasonable psychotherapy. With Psy-BaDo the psychotherapeutic treatment becomes simply a disease-management which defines its quality assurance by criteria of normalisation and thus follows the medical model of transformation disease into health. Medical psychotherapy as an integrated standard treatment offers itself to society as a monopolistic health supply agency. Psy-BaDo intends to adapt psychotherapeutic medicine to somato-psychiatric standards, ignores the differentiated level of knowledge and perception in psychotherapy for the sake of a legitimation as the most-favoured psychotherapy within the health care system.
