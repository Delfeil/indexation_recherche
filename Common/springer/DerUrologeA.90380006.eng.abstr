Classification systems of bladder dysfunction are mainly based on functional and urodynamic characteristics. Under functional aspects classification relates to disturbances of storage and emptying function and the behaviour of its components, the bladder and the bladder outlet. The International Continence Society established a committee for the standardisation of terminology of lower urinary tract function and recommended worldwide accepted standards of terminology. These standards are the basis for any classification system and should be used to facilitate comparison of results. In addition, classification of bladder dysfunction should be completed by a clinical investigation to define the risks of underlaying disorder.
