  Under normal conditions the coronary system of the human heart is not hermetically isolated from the surrounding structures nor the ventricles, but is in various ways connected to the adjacent arteries and the cardiac chambers. These natural connections have been models for most surgical efforts to revascularize the myocardium. Numerous anastomoses between the aorta and the coronary branches functionally resemble aorto-coronary bypass grafts. Coronaro-ventricular anastomoses do also exist in the myocardium and therefore transmyocardial laser revascularization should allow blood to penetrate from the ventricle into the myocardium. This process should not be called "reptilization" of the human heart, as in large reptilian hearts the nutrition of an extensive amount of myocardium only by diffusion is highly unlikely.
