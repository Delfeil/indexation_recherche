Chronic reduction in uteroplacental blood flow causes intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). In an animal model fetal umbilical perfusion in experimentally induced IUGR was examined. Pregnant sheep were instrumented with externally adjustable occluders on the common internal iliac artery to regulate uterine blood flow in the last third of gestation. Flow probes on the uterine arteries and the common umbilical artery provided blood flow measurements. Uterine blood flow was restricted in the group destined to become growth retarded whereas uterine blood flow in the equally instrumented controls was allowed to rise normally. When the experiment was terminated and morphometric data were obtained, uterine blood flow in controls was significantly higher than in restricted animals. Body weight and ponderal index in fetuses of flow-restricted mothers was significantly lower than in controls. Umbilical blood flow in IUGR animals was lower than in controls. The relation between uterine and umbilical blood flow became closer with advancing gestational age. Chronic reduction of uterine blood flow in late pregnant sheep causes IUGR accompanied by changes in umbilical blood flow which may be due to fetal adaptation.
