Renal lesions are frequently encountered in blunt pediatric abdominal trauma. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the incidence of renal trauma in these trauma patients to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were most predictive. From 1976 to 1996, 308 children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department. Patients were evaluated using abdominal paracentesis, ultrasonography, and urinary analysis. In specific cases, IV urography, CT scan, and/or angiography were applied. We used the Organ Injury Scale (OIS) for classification of renal trauma into five grades.
