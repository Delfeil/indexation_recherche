  Low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in particle size, density, and physical as well as chemical properties. Regarding size and density, LDL can be divided into two main profiles, LDL pattern A with elevated concentration of large, buoyant LDL particles and LDL pattern B with increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles. The latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of HDL and particularly HDL2 cholesterol. The LDL profile of increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. The LDL profile is partly genetically determined, but can be improved by non-pharmacological (exercise, diet) and pharmacological intervention. It remains to be confirmed whether the LDL subfraction profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides HDL2 cholesterol and triglycerides, but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk.
