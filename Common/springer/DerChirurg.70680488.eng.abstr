The aim of any abdominal wall reconstruction is maximal functional stability and adequate soft tissue coverage. The anatomy, elevation and clinical application of the myofascial tensor fasciae latae transposition flap and of the microvascular musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi free flap are presented. Repairing extensive fascial defects and recurrent hernias with the tensor fasciae latae transposition flap provides strong, dynamic, and functional reconstruction of fascial continuity to prevent a further recurrence. Adequate functional and aesthetic repair of a full-thickness abdominal wall defect can be optimally managed by the innervated microsurgical latissimus dorsi free flap.
