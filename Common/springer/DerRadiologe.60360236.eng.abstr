Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) was introduced as a minimally invasive form of therapy for tumors in different anatomic regions. However, in the orofacial region, it has not been used so far for inoperable T4 carcinomas. Since vascular and neural structures are often close to the tumor or are even involved, online monitoring of LITT is necessary. The aim of our study was to establish a method of monitoring LITT with MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in the orofacial region. Five patients with T4 carcinomas of the orofacial region underwent LITT under anesthesia. A 1.5 T whole-body imager with a circulary polarized head coil was used. Before and after the intervention, the region of interest was studied using T1- and T2-weighted sequences in axial and coronal planes, with and without contrast enhancement (intravenous Gd-DTPA). Temperature distribution was monitored with a T1-weighted 2D-FLASH (fast low angle shot) sequence. The positioning of the optical fibers was monitored with MRI. Nd: YAG laser equipment was used for laser application. The necrosis was best seen on contrast-enhanced MRI. Immediately after LITT, the outcome could be be determined by MRI. We proposed that MRI-guided LITT be used for neoplasms in the orofacial region at advanced stages.
