The prevalence of eating disorders in female athletes is significantly higher than in nonathletic controls. The highest prevalence of eating disorders is in athletes competing in sports where leaness and/or a specific weight are thought to be important for either performance or appearance. Dieting and other weight regulating practices are considered as risk factors. In some individuals however extreme exercise has to be regarded as a symptom of an already prominent eating disorder. Dieting may provoke impaired neurotransmitter activity and thus induce the vicious circle of a chronic eating disorder.
