In addition to metastasis, the differential diagnosis of multiple pulmonary nodules also includes tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and silicosis. Rarer diseases such as amyloid tumors, rheumatic nodules and plasma-cell granulomas can be the cause of this finding. This depends on the clinical manifestation.  Based on clinical findings of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, the problems in diagnostics using bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy and thoracoscopy are outlined. Etiology, morphology and differential diagnosis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis versus necrotizing inflammatory or neoplastic lesions are discussed. Treatment and prognosis are described.
