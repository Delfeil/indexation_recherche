White noise field campimetry is able to transform usually negative scotomas immediately into perceivable visual field defects. As this method needs a monitor, the obvious solution was to evaluate the suitability of the noise field stimulus broadcasted to home TV sets. Therefore, in cooperation with the "Süddeutscher Rundfunk" (SDR) as well as several health insurance companies ("AOK Baden-Württemberg" and other "RVO-Kassen"), approximately 300,000 viewers were invited to take this test after receiving brief information and instruction. There were 531 calls for questionnaires to document the subjects' findings and the results of a subsequent ophthalmological examination. In most cases this clarified the perceived noise field defect. Out of 127 evaluable questionnaires, 78 cases did not show any relevant ophthalmological pathology; this held true especially for lesions of the visual pathway. However, in 49 persons the ophthalmologists detected pathological findings; in 20 of these, the scotomas were previously unknown to the physicians. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy and macular degeneration were most frequently diagnosed as causing the white noise field defects. Finally, some preliminary estimates of the costs and benefit of this study are presented.
