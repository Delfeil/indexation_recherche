We investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding, administration of blood products, and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem (DIL) administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective CABG.  We retrospectively analyzed the surgical and ICU records of CABG patients who had recieved DIL (27 pats.) or nitroglycerin (NTG; 26 pats.) or a combination thereof (COM; 25 pats.). Data investigated included the amount of postoperative chest tube bleeding (CTB), frequency of administration of packed red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and changes in hemoglobin (Hb), thrombocyte (Th) levels as well as changes in prothrombin- (PT) and partial thromboplastine time (PTT).  There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to biometrical or operative data. The amount of CTB as well as the use of RBC and FFP were not significantly different between the groups. Also, there were no significant differences with regard to Hb or Th and PT or PTT, both in the early phase after the operation in ICU as well as after 24 hours in the ICU.  The perioperative administration of the calcium entery blocker DIL reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during CABG surgery. This administration during CABG surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding. As compared to NTG, DIL does not have negative effects on Hb and Th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first 24 hours in the ICU after CABG surgery.
