From Januar 1st 1990 to December 31st 1997, 614 children were treated for supracondylar humerus fracture at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in the Olga Hospital, Stuttgart. Ten of these children had concomitant vascular complications. The concept of treatment we had chosen was analysed retrospectively. The median patient age of the seven girls and three boys with vascular complications was six years. The vascular injuries were diagnosed after admission to the hospital by palpation of the wrist pulse, clinical appraisal of the vascularity and by registration of the Doppler signal via the arteries of the wrist. The emergency operations carried out initially comprised fragment reposition and fixation with crossed K wires via an access route on the extensor side in all ten children. The subsequent appraisal of the blood flow revealed a pulse restoration (transient vascular occlusion due to dislocation) in two out of the ten children. In eight out of the ten children, the pulse did not return, which is why the vessel had to be explored under emergency conditions. Intraoperatively, we saw a vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion in one of these eight children. Mechanical vascular occlusion were diagnosed in five of these eight children. In adventitial strangulation (two of these five children), the pulse transmission to the hand occured immediately after severance of the strangulation connective tissue. In intimal damage (three of these five children), the vascular segment concerned was resected and reconstructed, mostly in the form of an end-to-end-anastomosis with venous patch grafting. We observed a combined vascular occlusion (mechanical-functional occlusion) in two out of these eight children. In the follow-up investigation, the wrist pulses could be palpated in nine children. Nine children had a physiological signal in color duplex sonography, and one child had a pathological monophasic signal over the brachial artery, radial artery as well as the ulnar artery. Late ischemic damage (cold intolerance, claudicatio, Volkmann's contracture) were not detected in any of the children. Appraisal of elbow joint mobility revealed a median extension deficit of 0  ° (range 0-10  °), a median flexion deficit of 0  ° (range 0-15  °) and a normal pronation and supination equal on each side. The load-carrying joint axis was normal in a comparison of the sides in all children.
