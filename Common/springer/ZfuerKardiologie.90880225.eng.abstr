  The case of a 57 year old patient is reported, who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum CK and CKMB values of 821 and 84 U/l, respectively. The patient underwent bicycle exercise testing 9 days after a myocardial infarction in 25 W steps every 2 min starting with 50 W. The ergometry was interrupted at 125 W because of ST segment depression of 0.28 mV in V6. Systolic blood pressure dropped to 55 mm Hg, combined with severe angina and shock. Volume substitution and catecholamines did not elevate blood pressure. Immediate M-mode and Doppler echo revealed a "stiletto"-shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency. The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium, diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture. Despite of shock, mitral valve replacement was performed successfully. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction.
