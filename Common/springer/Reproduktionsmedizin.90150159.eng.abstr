The German embryo protection law prohibits any research on and with embryos if the embryo is not the immediate beneficiary. Accordingly, removal of pluripotent cells from an embryo is prohibited in Germany. The preparation of embryonic stem cells (ES cells) from blastocysts is carried out for reasons other than those aimed at preserving the embryo. Thus it is not compatible with the provisions of the embryo protection law. This is true also if the development of the embryo will not be impaired by the removal of some cells. Nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes aimed at generating pluripotent stem cells is prohibited also because this technique might be employed to clone human beings. Preparation of pluripotent stem cells from tissues of prematurely aborted dead foetuses or aborted foetuses can be carried out legitimately in Germany. This type of cell or tissue preparation is subject to regulation by the General Medical Council Guidelines (Richtlinien der Bundesärztekammer) for Usage of Foetal Cells and Foetal Tissues. The DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) concludes that currently there is no need to alter the German legal status concerning research with human pluripotent stem cells. It is the view of the DFG that the process of shaping opinions concerning ethical and embryological questions in relationship with research on stem cells has only just begun in Germany and abroad. The DFG suggests that this opinion-shaping process should take place on a broad basis and will take part in it. At the same time the DFG will make efforts to work towards the development of uniform European standards in this matter which will include also a due assessment of existential values such as human dignity and health which are fundamental and guaranteed by the constitutional law. With respect to future research on and with human stem cells the DFG believes that under all circumstances measures must be taken to rule out that embryos, sperm cells or oocytes will be allowed to develop from human pluripotent stem cells. In addition, effective measures will have to be taken to prevent cloning of human beings or generation of human beings with artificially altered genetic information. As an appropriate way the DFG suggests the establishment of a central commission assessing research projects with stem cells on the basis of ethical, legal, and scientific point of views, and fulfilling the role also of a supervisory attendant body.
