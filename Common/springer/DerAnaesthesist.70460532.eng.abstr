Background: The purpose of this study was to determine obstetrical pain management practices for labour for spontaneous and operative vaginal deliveries since there were no comparative German data available for the past 10 years. Methods: A mail survey was sent to the chief anaesthetists of all hospitals in North Rhine-Westfalia designated to have obstetrical beds. The confidential and standardised questionnaire consisted of 24 mainly multiple-choice questions relating to general issues and methods of analgesia and anaesthesia for vaginal deliveries. Results: In all, 118 completed replies to 258 sent questionnaires were received, giving a response rate of 46%. Among the 118 hospitals there were 79,157 vaginal deliveries annually. All participating hospitals practiced either systemic analgesics/spasmolytics and/or regional-anaesthetic methods (Table 2). Perineal local infiltration (23.7% of vaginal deliveries, in 99% of cases performed by the obstetrician) and epidural analgesia (23.2% of vaginal deliveries, in 81% of cases performed by an anaesthetist) were the commonest regional-anaesthetic methods. Pudendal nerve blocks were performed in 18.5% of vaginal deliveries (Table 1). Of all participating hospitals, 97% provided a 24-h epidural service. The method of epidural anaesthesia was widely homogeneous in all 118 hospitals (Table 3). Other methods of regional analgesia (i.e., epidural infusions or patient-controlled epidural analgesia) were performed only rarely. Conclusions: The methods of obstetrical analgesia and anaesthesia are on a high level and show a broad homogeneity in all hospitals. Overall, the results indicate, in comparison to former studies and in common with other countries, steadily increasing use of regional anaesthesia performed by anaesthetists in contrast to decreasing numbers of local infiltrations performed by obstetricians.
