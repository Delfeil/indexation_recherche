 Between October 1998 and December 1999 a mediastinoscopy was performed on 207 patients admitted to our institution, among them 147 with the diagnosis of bronchogenic cancer. Besides histology and location of the primary tumor, we particularly evaluated the detailed pattern of metastatic spread to mediastinal nodes and the assessed weight of the samples removed with the calculation of a normal distribution curve.    It was not possible to sample lymph nodes in all regions accessible to the procedure (subcarinal, paratracheal and tracheobronchial). A total of 94% of the samples were removed in the right tracheobronchial region, 92% subcarinal and 82% in the left tracheobronchial region. The average weight of the samples was quantified between 0.39 g (left paratracheal) and 1.12 g (subcarinal). Of the 147 mediastinoscopies 49% revealed no evidence of tumor within the mediastinum. Depending on lymph node region, 19-27% of lymph nodes were found to contain metastases. One region was involved in 20% of all patients, two or more regions in 31%. Central lesions had more frequently positive mediastinal nodes than peripheral lesions. The most striking influence on ipsi- and contralateral involvement was found for histology of the primary tumor: at least one region was positive in 61.4% of adenocarcinomas and 41.1% of squamous cell carcinomas. Ipsilateral mediastinal nodes (N2) were found to be positive in 26.8% of squamous cell cancer and in 41% of adenocarcinomas. A contralateral involvement (N3) has been proved in 16.1% (squamous cell carcinoma) and 29.5% (adenocarcinoma).    The diagnostic value of mediastinoscopy reflects the wide indication to this procedure as well as the necessity of representative samples. Thus, we recommend weighing the samples removed mediastinoscopically to establish a database in order to compare mediastinoscopy at different institutions. Distribution curves can help to standardize the method as a quality measurement.
