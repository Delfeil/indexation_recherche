Background: The results of the Cryo-ROP group showed that cryotherapy significantly reduces the rate of adverse morphological and functional outcome of eyes with threshold retinopathy of prematurity. Structural status and visual acuity of 48 eyes which consecutively underwent cryocoagulation in our hospital between 1990 and 1994 were examined at 2 years corrected gestational age.
