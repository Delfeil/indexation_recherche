A 59-year-old Caucasian man suffered from persistent disseminated necrolytic skin lesions for 8 months. They failed to respond to a variety of therapeutic regimens but then cleared spontaneously within a few days. After one week an invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx became clinically apparent. At autopsy, the expected glucagonoma often associated with necrolytic migratory erythema was not found.
