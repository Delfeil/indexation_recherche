To improve the insufficient vaccination rates of the general population in Germany, general practitioners play an important role as mediators. In actual practice, doctor's receptionists often have to control the certificates of vaccination and advise the patients. Therefore, in the offices for public health in Trier and Wittlich training courses were held. At the beginning the knowledge of the 102 participants was measured by a questionnaire. Results show that even those doctor's receptionists, who were very interested in vaccinations, had insufficient knowledge and to some part alarmingly few vaccinations themselves, especially to protect them against Influenza and Hepatitis B.
