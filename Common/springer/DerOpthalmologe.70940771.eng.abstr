Background: Keratoconus is associated with changes in the corneal structure, such as defects of Bowman's layer, a decrease of corneal thickness etc. They result in alterations of some of the biomechanical parameters of the cornea, namely, rigidity and elasticity. The present study was performed to examine how impression tonometry and applanation tonometry for determination of intraocular pressure (IOP) are affected by the changed biomechanical parameters associated with keratoconus.
