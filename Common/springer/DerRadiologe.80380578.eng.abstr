By interdisciplinary cooperation with the German Societies for Angiology, Phlebology and Vascular Surgery, recommendations have been worked out which address the indication of phlebography of the veins of the extremities and which define the quality standards of phlebographic techniques. The specific clinical questions in varicose syndrome, acute thrombosis and postthrombotic syndrome have to be answered by employing adequate phlebographic technique, documentation, and description of relevant morphologic and functional findings.
