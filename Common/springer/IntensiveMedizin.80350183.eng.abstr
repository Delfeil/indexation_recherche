 For many years the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome has been on the top of medical articles about the intensive care patient. While severity scores deal with the 1st ICU day physiology, the organ dysfunction systems aim to take in account the duration type and severity of physiologic disturbances during the ICU stay. Most of the published systems have been created by a panel of experts, giving to each dysfunction a number of points, usually 1 to 4, according to the severity. Only 2 systems are different: the MODS of Marshall et al. and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction LOD system of Le Gall et al., both published recently (1995 and 1996). They differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review (MDOS) or from a logistic regression (LOD), and secondly, because neither takes into account the therapy. Besides, the LOD system, when used on the 1st ICU day, has statistical qualities which are very promising. The LOD system is now used each consecutive day on septic patients in an European multicenter study.
