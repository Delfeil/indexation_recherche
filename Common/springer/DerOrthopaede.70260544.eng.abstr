Low back pain is the most expensive condition in industrialized countries. Approximately 65-80 % of the population will be afflicted with low back pain at some point during their life. Low back pain has many causes and can originate from any of several pain-sensitive foci, among which are facet joints, sacroiliac joint, muscle and ligaments. Primary care in the acute phase consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to address the biochemical and inflammatory mediators of pain or skeletal muscle spasmolytics to reduce low back pain symptoms. Injection procedures should be reserved for the patients with low back pain who fail to respond to a directed, conservative treatment trial and have had pain for at least 2 weeks' duration. Eliminating sensation from a certain pain source has been proposed as a way to allow an examiner to determine if that joint is responsible for the patient's pain. Injections of local anesthetic into the facet joint or around its nerve supply are clinical methods of eliminating pain from focal areas such as facet joints or myofascial trigger points. When a particular joint is determined to be the source of pain, long-term relief can be sought by directing therapeutic interventions at that joint. The anatomic accessibility of the most common pain sources of low back pain make diagnostic blocks and therapeutic instillation of corticosteroids particularly appealing. If used, their potential benefit for the individual case needs to be carefully weighed. They should be used to facilitate more aggressive conservative care and not as an isolated treatment. Certainly, if response to corticosteroids does not occur after the first injection, no further administration of corticosteroids is indicated.
