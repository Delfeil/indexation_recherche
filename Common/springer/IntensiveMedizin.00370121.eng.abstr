 After a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin, a 63 year old patient developed right-sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia, septic-toxic circulatory failure, and thrombocytopenia. Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT) type II was diagnosed. Because of contraindications against thrombolysis a cava-filter was implanted, heparin therapy was stopped, and anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin was started. Inspite of this, an arterial thrombosis of the A. femoralis superficialis developed and had to be treated surgically. From this time on, no further thromboembolic complications were noticed. Overlapping coumarin therapy was begun. Due to ubiquitous coumarin-necrosis, rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy. A second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin-necrosis without the need for re-operation. Subsequent coumarin-therapy, which was gradually increased over two weeks, was without further complications. Thus, hirudin appears to be a new and safe alternative to a therapy with the heparinoid danaparoid in HAT type II with fulminant thromboembolic complications and especially in coumarin-necrosis with critical septic-toxic circulatory failure and DIC.
