The therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than 30 years. A total of 83 patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as ingle-centre, long-term open (12 months) clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid ester preparations Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm. The antipsoriatic effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear, with a mean reduction of 76% in PASI. Adverse events in were noted in 62% of the patients (mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints). These were dose-dependent and decreased in frequency in the course of the study. No severe adverse events occurred. We believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy-resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long-term application.
