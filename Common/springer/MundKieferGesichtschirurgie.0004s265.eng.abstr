The first publications in dentoalveolar surgery date back to the eighteenth century, while basic works in German-speaking areas appeared in the first half of the 20th century. Dentoalveolar surgical issues are still present within craniomaxillofacial surgery nowadays. Nomenclature has changed little while contents in certain areas shift away from surgical practical aspects towards biological-medical points of view. The new technologies of dentoalveolar surgery are being developed for maximal patient safety using minimal invasive methods. Other, traditionally non-surgical, dental subspecialities are taking over dentoalveolar surgical issues. Oral surgery remains a part of craniomaxillofacial surgery and should continue to get a major boost from it in the future.
