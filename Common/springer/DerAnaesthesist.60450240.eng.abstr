The right ventricle is more jeopardized by a cardiopulmonary bypass than the left one. Impaired right ventricular performance may profit from an afterload reduction. A selective reduction in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) or pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) without impairment of the systemic circulation seems to be possible by inhalation of nitric oxide (NO). Therefore in the present study we looked for influences of NO inhalation on PAP, PVR and right heart parameters immediately after weaning from the bypass. The dependence of endothelial function on age, preoperative heart function and extracorporeal circulation is well established. The relevance of such parameters on NO inhalation was also investigated.
