The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since viable pathogen has been recovered from plaques. Chlamydiae are epithelial pathogens notorious for causing persistent infection. Atherosclerosis, however, is a chronic inflammatory disease involving mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall. A bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the resident mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously.
