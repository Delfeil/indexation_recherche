 To date there are not enough data concerning the prognostic value of dynamic QT analysis for malignant arrhythmic events after acute myocardial infarction. It was the  to investigate, whether such patients have a different behavior of dynamic QT intervals in comparison to an identical group without arrhythmic events.  In a prospective study, 239 consecutive patients after thrombolytic and if necessary interventional therapy for acute myocardial infarction were followed for 1100+/-303 days. Eight patients suffered an arrhythmic event (sudden cardiac death: 6 patients, sustained ventricular tachycardia: 2 patients) during follow-up. These patients were matched to 8 patients without arrhythmic event who were comparable concerning age, gender, site and former incidence of infarction, duration until start of lysis, peak level of CPK release, and LV-ejection fraction (matched pairs). All patients had 24 hour Holter ECG recordings 27+/-3 days after acute myocardial infarction. Dynamic beat-to-beat QT interval analysis was performed by using a commercially available system (Pathfinder 700, Reynolds Medical, Hertford, UK).  Following parameters were compared: mean and beat-to-beat standard deviation of all QT intervals to the end of the T wave, mean and beat-to-beat standard deviation of all QT intervals to the apex of the T wave, as well as these values corrected for heart rate (Bazett's formula). Comparing the two groups, there were no significant differences concerning all investigated parameters.  In this study, the parameters of dynamic QT analysis could not discriminate the investigated population of patients after acute myocardial infarction with arrythmic event from those without arrhythmic event. Whether the analysis of dynamic QT dispersion over 24 hours by using a multiple lead configuration could be useful for a better identification of patients at risk for sudden cardiac death remains to be evaluated by further studies.
