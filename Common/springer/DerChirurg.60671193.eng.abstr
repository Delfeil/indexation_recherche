 Biocoral is a biomaterial derived from natural corals, and it has surgical applications. Since 1992 the author has been using this material as a bone graft substitute in maxillofacial surgery. Seventy-seven clinical implantations were done for different indications. The results suggest that coral grafts are well tolerated and become partially ossified when the calcified skeleton is resorbed. This material has been demonstrated to be successful.
