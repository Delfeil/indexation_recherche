 Shock secondary to sepsis is a serious common disease with a substantial mortality. Coagulation abnormalities, ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, are well recognized in patients with bacterial septicemia. Therefore, the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps. We investigated 30 intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of abnomalities in coagulation at the beginning. Fifteen patients were treated with 1.5-5 E/kg body weight (Low dose group), the others received 8-15 E/kg (high dose group). Our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters - such as d-dimer, TAT and PTF 1 + 2 - in the High dose group without any bleeding disorder. Thus, we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with LMWH as shown above.
