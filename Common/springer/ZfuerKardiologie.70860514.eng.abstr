  34 patients aged 3 months to 20years underwent transcatheter-occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils (Cook). Eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a Rashkind-occluder; 7 patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition. Only 6 patients had a large ductus with a diameter between 3 and 4 mm; all had systolic-diastolic murmurs. All other patients had ductus-diameters below 3 mm; three of them had systolic-diastolic murmurs, 17 had systolic murmurs, and 8 patients had no murmur at all. The ductus was closed in 24 patients using artrial access only, in 6 patients via a venous, and in 4 patients both via venous and arterial catheterization. One coil was used in 23 patients, 2 coils in 9, and 3 coils in 2 patients. There were no complications of the intervention. Within 24 hours 31 patients (93%) had complete closure of the ductus and 32 patients (94%) after 6 months. Coil-embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick, safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation.
