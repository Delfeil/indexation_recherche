Clinical information is indispensable for swift and cost-effective clarification of diseases of the larynx. While quality clarification of neurological changes in the area of the posterior cranial fossa and in the course of the vagus nerve as a cause of glottis malfunction is possible with MRI, localized disease of the larynx can more effectively be assessed with low-artifact CT. In the particularly difficult assessment of the post-operative larynx, a recurrence can be diagnosed only after a baseline study has been carried out after the end of therapy. With knowledge of the pre-therapeutic findings, the findings immediately post-therapy, and the operation technique used, the optimal CT examination, which can be carried out quickly, will be able to provide more information about recurrence.
