 Pain is the result of complex neuronal activities within the brain and not simply the result of peripheral activities of the nociceptive system. Pain results from an interaction of many neuronal modules located in different brain areas. This interaction is modified by anticipation, learning, and perception. Electrophysiological phenomena allow the characterization of the information processings associated with pain. This characterization is important for theoretical purposes and for the evaluation of different therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, electrophysiological phenomena support the investigation of functional plasticity in the brain as one of the consequences of chronic pain processing. It is expected that new methods of cortical source analysis will contribute considerably to our understanding of different aspects of pain processing and of the management of pain.
