Gliomas: As we demonstrated for supratentorial, diffuse gliomas in adults, a stratification into just two grades of malignancy, 'low' and 'high grade', proved reliable and prognostically relevant. The discriminating histomorphological criterion for high-grade astrocytoma (WHO glioblastoma) as well as anaplastic oligodendroglioma and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma is endothelial hyperplasia/proliferation, which is usually associated with uptake of contrast medium in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. As neoangiogenesis indicates glioma progression, it is worthwhile considering these radiographic features to judge the representativeness of the tumor samples critically.
