Cutaneous adverse drug reactions in HIV-positive patients with their wide spectrum of manifestations remain a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Skin diseases as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis belong to this group. The typical primary lesions are erythematous macules and papules, which rapidly extend to the entire body and may be accompained by a extensive epidermal detachment. Diagnosis and immediate therapy is indispensable because of the possible fulminant course of the disease. We report a HIV-positive patient with a cutaneous adverse drug reaction showing predominantly hemorrhagic lesions.
