 In a 71-year-old woman with macroglossia and heart failure, a monoclonal protein (K-light chains) was found in the serum. Congestive heart failure was diagnosted on the basis of heart catherization and echocardiography. The tongue biopsy showed numerous amyloid fibrils, and plasmacytosis was present in the bone marrow. All these findings indicated a restrictive cardiomyopathy as part of a primary systemic amyloidosis.
