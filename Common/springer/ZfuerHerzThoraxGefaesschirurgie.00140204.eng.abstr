 In Germany about 75000 patients received the CABG operation last year, these are about 75% of all open heart operation procedures. The most frequently used conduit is the greater saphenous vein. In the last years a lot of new minimally invasive techniques for vein harvesting revolutionized the field of CABG operation procedures, nevertheless the most common technique today is the traditional, open technique with long, continuous incision for the open preparation of the saphenous vein. Using traditional open saphenectomy, wound healing disturbances are common and have been reported to occur in 5-25% of patients. The prevalence of wound healing disturbances varies widely, depending to some degree of definition, as well of the intensity of follow up. Minimal and less invasive vein harvesting studies have been shown to be effective in decreasing leg wound disturbances, resulting much superior cosmetic results. Advantages and disadvantages of minimally invasive vein harvesting techniques are today the topic of controversy discussions in heart surgery.   We reported our experience of modified minimally invasive harvesting of the saphenous vein using the Aesculap retractor system with performing 3-4 small cutaneous incisions. According to our experience these results show that the use of modified minimally invasive harvesting of the great saphenous vein is an attractive alternative to the traditional open harvest technique with fewer wound complication, more patient satisfaction and excellent cosmetic aspects. Therefore, we hope that less or minimally invasive systems for harvesting of the saphenous vein will be established in the future in CABG operation procedures.
