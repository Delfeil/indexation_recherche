 This study on myometrium cells from pregnant rats reports on the first evaluation of a possible interaction between substances known to lead to an induction or inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by binding on -adrenoceptors, and the formation of nitric oxide (NO). From 7 rats on the 17th day of gestation and from 7 sub partu, the uterus was removed and 100 mg of myometrium strips were incubated (37  °C, 5% CO2) for 24 hours with ritodrine resp. propranolol, each in 2 concentrations (10-3, 10-7 M in culture medium) resp. a control solution (culture medium pure). After incubation the total concentration if nitrites in each culture medium was determined. Compared to the controls, with the betamimetic ritodrine 10-3 M in medium an increase in the nitrite concentration on day 17 was found (264.14  +/-  124.58 vs. 180.03  +/-  89.4 nmol/g, n. s.). The medium incubated with the-blocker propranolol 10-3 M however had a clearly lower nitrite concentration (day 17: 112.93  +/-  50.32 vs. 180.03  +/-  89.4 nmol/g, n. s.; sub partu: 65.48  +/-  25.28 vs. 260.48  +/-  196.76 nmol/g, p<0.05); in each case, mean +/- standard deviation, n = 7. These preliminary results support the hypothesis that there is an interaction between cAMP, formed via the-adrenoceptor system, and the NO formation in rat myometrium.
