 Referring to relevant literature, various concepts are discussed in the treatment of habitual dislocation of the kneecap. Between 1987 and 1997, 88 patients have been treated surgically in our clinic by uni- or bilateral medial transfer of the tibial tuberositas. In 21 of the cases lateral release was also performed. In the follow-up, after an average of 4.9 years, 79 patients were examined clinically, radiologically and isokinetically (Kintrex-Dynamometer). Isokinetic measurement of the extension showed an average deficit of 19 nm compared to the contralateral side. Using the Juliusson and Markhede scores, 51 cases had a good, 18 a fair and 10 a poor clinical outcome. In 79 % of the cases, the postoperative sports activity level was the same as preoperatively. Isokinetic measurement with the Kintrex is a useful method of evaluating the development of muscle strength.
