 Reconstruction of a regurgitant bicuspid aortic valve is a new alternative to aortic valve replacement. With concomitant aortic root dilatation adequate reconstruction is feasible by valve-sparing aortic replacement.    Between 10/95 and 02/00, 30 patients underwent reconstruction of a regurgitant bicuspid aortic valve. Additional aortic replacement was performed in 23 cases. Valve reconstruction was performed by plication of the prolapsing leaflet. No patient died peri- or postoperatively. Freedom from aortic valve regurgitation >=II as well as freedom from reoperation were 100% after 48 months.    Reconstruction of a regurgitant bicuspid aortic valve is feasible with encouraging mid-term results. With concomitant dilatation of the ascending aorta, a combination of aortic replacement and valve reconstruction can achieve stable results even in bicuspid valve anatomy.
