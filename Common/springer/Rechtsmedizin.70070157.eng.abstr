 Five efficient STR systems were investigated by automated laser fluorescence analysis on an A.L.F. Express. The system HumACTBP2 and the combinations of the systems HumVWA/FGA and HumTH01/D12S391 in duplex reactions were analysed. DNA samples could be analysed with a high sensitivity (100 pg) and the results were reproducible. No allele drop-out was observed. Using specific allelic ladders, the inter and intra gel deviation was less than 0.5 bp. The allele frequencies, the mean exclusion chance values and the discrimination power  for all five systems are shown. The combination of the five systems resulted in a power of discrimination of 99.9999989%.
