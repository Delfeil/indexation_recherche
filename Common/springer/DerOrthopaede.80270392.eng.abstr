We compared the outcome of cementless hip arthroplasty in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases (cases) and patients with osteoarthritis (controls). Between 1985 and 1993 we implanted 26 cementless hips in 22 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis or Ankylosing Spondylitis.From a pool of more than 600 patients with Osteoarthritis we chose 40 matched controls (41 hips). Matching variables were year of implantation, age, follow-up'eight, weight, gender and type of implant. At follow-up (cases: 58  +/-  27 months; controls: 56  +/-  26 Monate) no signs of loosening or migration of the stem were found, neither in the cases nor in the controls. Loose and/or migrated cups were found in 4 patients with rheumatic diseases (after 44, 65, 65 and 107 months) and in 3 patients with osteoarthritis (after 63, 84 and 100 months). Two cups were revised within 18 months in the control group, in the case group one revision was necessary after 5 years. Loosening and revision rates did not differ significantly (p > 0.20). Clinically, those with Osteoarthritis had a better extension (p < 0.02), were more satisfied with their (artificial) hips (p < 0.05) and did better in some activities of daily living (climbing stairs, dressing, sitting/standing up). Within a mean follow-up of 5 years the results of patients with chronic rheumatic diseases seem to be comparable to those of a matched control-group of patients with Osteoarthritis. Differences between the groups concern areas, in which rheumatic patients are handicapped due to their chronic illness. Nevertheless, we need long-term-results, before we can recommend cementless implants for these patients.
