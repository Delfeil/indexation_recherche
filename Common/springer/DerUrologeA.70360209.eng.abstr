After treatment of more than 3000 kidney and ureteral stones with the Siemens Lithostar Multiline the results of the first 1400 ureteral stone treatments using the "Booster technique" and 3-month follow-up findings are reported. There was a disintegration rate of 98 % directly after treatment; 1 week after "Booster technique" treatment 96 % of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms. The 3-month follow-up showed a stone-free rate of 97 %. Only in 13 % of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary, 7 % of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and 6 % after ESWL. 43 % of the treatments were performed without any premedication, anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia. Our data even prove that in situ ESWL is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones. In comparison to endoscopic procedures, it is superior in regard to invasivity, side effects, complications and neccessity of analgesia, while being just as efficient. Therefore it is recommended as first choice method in the treatment of ureteral stones.
