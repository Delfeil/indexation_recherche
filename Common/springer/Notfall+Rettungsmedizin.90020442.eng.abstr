The Institute of Rescue Service carried out this study as a first stocktaking with the aim of demonstrating possible common factors but also differences between the different pre-hospital systems. An essential factor for the structure and organisation of emergency medical services - apart from the political framework conditions - is represented by the geographical infrastructure as well as by the system of the health care of the population. Rescue services and/or emergency medical care are basically seen as a public and/or government task with the relevant laws and regulations constituting the basis for this. In most countries the organisation of the emergency medical services follows the criteria of the so-called "rescue time", however to different scopes and extents. As regards the access possibilities to the rescue service system the corresponding co-ordination centre/rescue head office is activated via a usually standardised country-specific emergency telephone number. In almost all studied countries doctors are more or less involved in the pre-hospital emergency care. The training of the paramedical staff usually takes place in several stages of training leading to different qualifications. This synoptic representation demonstrates that partly considerable differences exist as regards to the organisational and infrastructural as well as the political development of the emergency medical services. The synoptic representation offers the possibility of elucidating possible differences between the systems which, in a later step, might be considered to be potential solutions for country-/region-specific particularities.
