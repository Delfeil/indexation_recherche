Progressive dyspnoea developed in a 37-year-old woman over a period of 2 months. A chest x-ray and echocardiography revealed a massive dilatation of the heart with thrombi in both ventricles. The endomyocardial biopsy was classified as myocarditis in two different departments of pathology. The patient developed thromboembolic events and an untreatable heart failure which led to the patient's death. The necropsy revealed a dilated 600-gram-heart and thrombi in both ventricles. On histological and immunhistological examination of the heart, the original diagnosis was corrected to catecholamine-induced dilated cardiomyopathy.
