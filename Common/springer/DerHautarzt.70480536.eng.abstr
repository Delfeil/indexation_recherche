The pulsed dye laser (wavelength 585 nm, pulse duration 0,3-0,45 ms) is very effective in the treatment of port-wine stains, beginning hemangiomas, telangiectasias, spider nevi, xanthelasma and red hypertrophic scarring. It is the laser of choice in the therapy of young patients with port-wine stains. The pulsed dye laser is limited by its relatively superficial penetration into the skin with a maximum of 1,5 mm.
