 Procalcitonin is the propeptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity. Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland. In healthy humans procalcitonin levels are undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml). During severe generalized infections (bacterial, parasitic and fungal) with systemic manifestations, procalcitonin levels may rise up to 100 ng/ml. In contrast, severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non-infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels. The exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity.
