Subacute encephalopathy with seizures in alcoholics (SESA syndrome) is a rare disease entity following chronic alcohol ingestion. It is quite distinct from alcohol withdrawal syndromes, such as delirium, withdrawal seizures or CNS complications of alcohol, such as Wernicke-Korsakow syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis or Marchiafava-Bignami disease, and was proposed in 1981 by Niedermeyer and coworkers. This syndrome consists of multiple neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis or hemianopia, and of recurrent focal and generalized seizures associated with prominent EEG features (peri-odic lateralized discharges, PLEDs). A 72-year-old Caucasian male with chronic alcoholism and an otherwise unremarkable past medical history was admitted to our hospital be-cause of several secondary generalized simple partial seizures. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase and of mean corpuscular volume. Other laboratory investigations and the CSF examinations on three occasions revealed normal values. Cranial computed and magnetic resonance tomography showed cerebral microangiopathy and generalized atrophy. Despite triple anticonvulsive therapy and an intravenous treatment with acyclovir and thiamine, the epileptic seizures persisted. Several EEGs revealed left parieto-occipital perodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). The patient died of an intercurrent pulmonary infection about 3 months after the onset of symptoms. The described clinical picture resembles the symptoms of SESA syndrome.
