Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a syndrome affecting an extremity after a minor trauma or operation. At the moment there is no consensus about the pathogenesis of RSD. In 1942 Paul Sudeck suggested that the signs and symptoms of RSD may be provoked by an exaggerated inflammatory response to injury or operation of an extremity. His theory found no disciples, as most physicians believe that RSD is initiated by an hyperactive sympathetic system. We performed various clinical and experimental investigations, including the effects of antiinflammatory treatment. The results of these studies support the theory of Paul Sudeck.
