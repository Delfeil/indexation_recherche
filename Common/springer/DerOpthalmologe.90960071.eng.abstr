Capillary retinal angiomas are rare vascular tumors that frequently occur in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (vHL) but may also be sporadic. In all patients presenting with this tumor a thorough search for other vHL-associated lesions must be performed. After identification of the vHL gene on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26), the diagnosis is supported by molecular genetic analysis.
