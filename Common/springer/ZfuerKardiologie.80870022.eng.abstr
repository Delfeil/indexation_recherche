 As pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current, the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current. Whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow-up, was studied in 87 patients who received the VDD-single lead UniPass 425 connected to the pacemaker Unity (Sulzer Intermedics). The impedance changes between implantation and 6 months follow-up were assessed for each patient. Similar impedance values were defined, if the two measurements were within a range <= -100 to +100 . Six-months impedance was lower or higher compared to implantation, if the difference exceeded > -100 or > +100 . At implantation, impedance was 535  +/-  98  (range: 333-811 ) and significantly increased to 604  +/-  160  (range: 361-1150 ) after 6 months. Mean difference between the two measurements was 69  +/-  162  (range: -336 bis +560 ). Similar impedance had 43 (implantation: 527  +/-  75 , 6 months: 531  +/-  87 ), lower values 11 (implantation: 660  +/-  83 , 6 months: 494  +/-  73 ) and higher values 33 patients (implantation: 503  +/-  99 , 6 months: 735  +/-  168 ). Compared to the patients with similar impedance patients with lower impedance had a significantly higher impedance values at implantation. Conclusions: Pacing impedance increased significantly within 6 months after implantation. Pacing impedance changed > 100  in 51% of the patients. The long-term follow-up of pacing impedance can be predicted generally, but not for the individual patient.
