 Psychoanalysis is regarded to be mainly disorderoriented. Indeed, since its beginning, it was characterised by the two-sided orientation towards disorder and resources. Contemporary concepts of the psychoanalytic encounter, especially actualgenetic conceptions of the analysis of transference, lay the ground for better integrating both aspects. This development implies new approaches to the psychoanalytic process and technique, and especially to interpretation. More than before, contemporary psychoanalytic interpretation refers to progressive coping strategies within and outside transferential processes.
