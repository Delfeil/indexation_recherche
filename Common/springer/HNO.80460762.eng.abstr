Aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare. The literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations. In the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right-sided intrapetrous aneurym after myringotomy, which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media. Due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible. Subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms. Leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle, fascia lata and a gelatin-resorcin-formalin-glue (Cardial). In order to apply the tissue patch the hypotympanic site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior otosurgical approach. Due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries. Temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm. Following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy.
