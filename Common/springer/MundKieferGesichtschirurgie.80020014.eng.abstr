So-called "glossitis granulomatosa", described in 1952 by  H. Schuermann as a peculiar manifestation of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS), is little  known in oral medicine due to the paucity of cases published so far. During the past 25 years the author has observed eight definite cases of glossitis granulomatosa and confirmed its close connections with MRS. The recurrent inflammation tends to change into persisting macroglossia with considerable functional and sensory oral disturbances. The clinical diagnosis, histologically supported by biopsy, can definitely be established, yet the outcome of the mostly chronic macroglossitis (with danger of later tongue carcinoma) may be very doubtful. Knowledge of Schuermann's glossitis, a member of the group of etiologically unclarified lingual inflammations, is important for physicians involved in oral medicine because of its therapeutic and prognostic implications.
