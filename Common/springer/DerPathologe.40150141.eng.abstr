Abstract.  This article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es. Standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained. Different models of in vitro culture - monolayer, three-dimensional tumor cultures, and organ cultures - are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret ation of in vivo tissue. Two important recent extensions of tissue culture, serum-free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells, are described.
