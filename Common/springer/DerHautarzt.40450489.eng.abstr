 We report on the case of a 75-year-old woman patient with tuberculosis colliquativa cutis (scrofuloderma). The skin lesions had developed from a cervical lymph node tuberculosis. The diagnosis was made by culturing biopsied skin and underlying lymph node. Under a triple drug regimen the skin lesions cleared within 2 months. Lymph nodes appeared to be normal after 6 months. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to scrofuloderma and cervical lymph node tuberculosis are discussed.
