 Patients with unstable angina and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) represent a high risk group for transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR). One-hundred-twenty-six consecutive patients with endstage coronary disease were perioperatively evaluated. TMLR combined with the perioperative use of an IABP was performed in 16 patients (IABP group) with unstable angina, signs of congestive heart failure, and EF<40%. These patients are compared with 39 patients who had significantly fewer signs of congestive heart failure, unstable angina, and were treated with TMLR: Thirty-nine patients with EF>40% (EF>40% group). Perioperative mortality in the IABP group (12.5%) and EF>40% group (5%) was not different (p=ns). Although IABP was preoperatively started, hemodynamic assessment revealed deterioration of LV function shortly after TMLR (p=0.036) only in the IABP group. Nevertheless, IABP assistance helped to ameliorate LV function after 2 (p=0.02) and further after 6 hours (p=0.0003) post-TMLR. In all groups a significantly improved clinical status (p<=0.01) and treadmill tolerance (p<0.05) was observed 6 and 12 months after operation, whereas cardiac metabolism, perfusion, and function were not significantly changed (p=ns). The reported data support our concept of starting IABP preoperatively in patients with reduced LV contractile reserve. One year after TMLR, patients exhibited improvement in subjective, but not in objective parameters.
