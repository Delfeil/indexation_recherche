 Patients with rheumatic diseases are commonly treated as an outpatient in their local environment or are referred to specialized centers. Two recently founded daypatient clinics in Berlin and Frankfurt/Rhein-Main (Germany) for patients suffering from rheumatic diseases will be evaluated for their medical outcome and cost-effectivness of comprehensive treatment of RA patients in stages of high inflammatory activity and progressive disability. The study design will be prospective, controlled, and randomized to compare outpatient and daypatient treatment. The case-control study design with matched pairs within the network of collaborative arthritis centers will be used to compare daypatient and inpatient treatment. The paper contains a review of studies published in English or German language dealing with daypatient treatment of RA patients.
