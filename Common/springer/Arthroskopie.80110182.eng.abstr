This paper reports the follow-up examination of 10 patients with opened epiphyseal cartilage and 16 patients with closed epiphyseal cartilage. These patients were operated with drilling on the lesion of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee. The average follow-up time was 4 years. The subjective and objective results were compared according to the condition of the epiphyseal cartilage. Both groups of patients profited in the same way subjectively and clinically by the treatment when evaluated by the Lysholm-score. However, the juvenile patients had a lower level of complaints both preoperatively and at the time of the follow-up exam. In the radiological follow-up most of the patients with a closed physis showed arthrotic changes and persistent defects of the osteochondritis dissecans, whereas in the juvenile group no arthrotic deformities were noticeable. This study confirms that the ideal time period for a drilling operation of osteochondritis dissecans is before epiphyseal cartilage closure.
