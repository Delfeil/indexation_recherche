 The aim of sentinel node biopsy (SN) in breast cancer patients is to detect the tumor-draining lymph node by means of isosulfan blue or 99mTc-labelled colloids. SN can be detected in 80 to 85 % of the patients, depending on the size of the tumor. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy permits the draining nodes along the internal mammary artery also to be visualized. The predictive value of the histological findings of SN for lymph nodes obtained from axillary dissection is about 95 %. Because of different diagnostic procedures using various radiotracers each center has to follow its own learning curve. To be sure that the nodal status derived from a SN procedure is of identical value to axillary dissection about 100 patients have to undergo sentinel node detection, followed by axillary dissection, and concordant results should be obtained in 95 % of them at least. The SN, however, offers a chance of assessing the lymph node at risk for metastasis by more detailed histological procedures. Morbidity as a result of treatment for primary breast cancer can be decreased if only patients suffering from metastatic disease are subjected to axillary dissection. Currently, the indication criteria for a SN procedure should be restricted to small tumors (T1) with clinically uninvolved axillary status and patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).
