Interferon-alpha (IFN-) is of high interest in the adjuvant treatment of malignant melanoma. During long term treatment, psychiatric side effects play an important role and not infrequently lead to reduction or discontinuation of therapy. Most common are sleeping disturbance, agitation, weariness, sleepiness, irritability, social withdrawal and depression, which most often develop during the first three months of the therapy. Also more severe side effects may occur, like delirium, organic depression, psychotic episodes and organic personality change, which in some patients may even lead to suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts, which is illustrated in two case reports. Therapeutic intervention depend to the severity of side effects. Moderate depressive syndromes may successfully be treated by antidepressive drugs like serotonine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), which may even allow continuation of IFN- therapy. In patients with severe depression or organic personality changes with increased risk of suicide, immideate discontinuation of IFN- therapy is mandatory and treatment in a psychiatric hospital must be considered.
