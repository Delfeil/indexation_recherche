 From January 1992 until December 1996, 221 men and 79 women underwent an operation because of bronchial carcinoma (n=197), pulmonary metastases (n=49), other malignant tumors of the lung (n=48) and bronchial carcinoids (n=8). The mean age was 63.8 years. 51% of the male and 14.7% of the female patients had a bronchial carcinoma; the histological classification of the bronchial carcinomas for men and women was squamous cell carcinoma 36.7%/8.9%, adeno-carcinoma 23.1%/40.5%, large cell carcinoma 6.8%/5.1%, small cell carcinoma 2.7%/1.3%, other malignant tumors of the lung 12.3%/3%, for pulmonary metastases 8.7%/7.7%, and for bronchial carcinoids 1.7%/1%. Above 40% of the patients had have lung diseases in their anamnesis. 52.4% were smokers; 70.5% of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma and 71.4% with small cell lung cancer were smokers with a packyear-loading of 50. 26.3% showed complications in the postoperative time, mostly pneumonia and broncho-pleural fistula. After a mean time of 7.1 months, 64.9% of the patients showed local cancer relapses or distant metastases. The mean survival time in the case of bronchial carcinoma was 32 months; the 5-year survival rate was 11%. For the other malignant tumors of the lung it was 14 months, and the survival rate declined to 0% after 41 months. For pulmonary metastases, the 5-year survival rate was 60.5% and for bronchial carcinoids the 31/2-year survival rate was 100%.
