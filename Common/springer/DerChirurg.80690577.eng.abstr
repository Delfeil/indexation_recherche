 A 38-year-old polytoxicomanic male patient developed an occlusion of both popliteal arteries associated with an aneurysm of the right common iliac artery. A septic cause was suspected and an antimycotic therapy was instituted, but the diameter of the aneurysm increased to 3 cm during 6 months. Moreover, multiple periarterial abscesses occurred. The aneurysm was resected and the iliacal axis reconstructed in situ, using a superficial femoral vein interposition. Six months after operation, patency was confirmed by duplex sonography. Phlebodynamic examinations showed normal flow functions at the donor site.
