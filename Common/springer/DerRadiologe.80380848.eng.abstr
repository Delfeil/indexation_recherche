Purpose: Computer-aided diagnosis in mammography is a topic many study groups have been concerned with since the first  presentation of a system for computer-aided interpretation in 1967. Currently, there is only one system available for clinical use in mammaography, the CAD-System Image Checker (R2 Technology). The purpose of our prospective study was to evaluate whether the integration of the CAD-system into the routine of a radiological breast diagnosis unit is feasible.
