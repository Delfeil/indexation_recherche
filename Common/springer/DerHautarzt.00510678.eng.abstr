Drug-induced leucocytoclastic vasculitis is clinically characterised by inflammation of small vessels and skin alterations, typically palpable purpura. Often the vasculitis is accompanied by fever, myalgia and malaise. All ages and sexes are equally affected. Besides the mentioned clinical features it may also present as macules, papules, vesicules, bullae, subcutaneous nodules or intermittent or chronic urticarial eruptions. Other organ systems may be affected. The patient's history is helpful in identifying the etiologic agent. If a drug is suspected as etiologic agent, a positive lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) supports the hypothesis. A 55 year old femal patient developed an ANA and anti-histone antibody positive leukocytoclastic vasculitis with probable concomittant renal involvement after three weeks treatment with ibuprofen. Three months after discontinuation of the medication, the patient is without complaints and has a normal urine sedimentation and normalized immunoautoantibodies.
