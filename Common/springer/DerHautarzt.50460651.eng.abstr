A case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported. One of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma, and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland. The relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata, dermal cylindroma and multiple trichoepitheliomata is discussed.
