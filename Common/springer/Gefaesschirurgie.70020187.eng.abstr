 We report on 7534 carotid artery reconstructions performed during a 14-month period. The clinical data from 141 surgical centres participating in the quality control program of the German Society for Vascular Surgery were collected and statistically analyzed according to predetermined criteria. The large amount of the large data enabled an analysis of diagnosis and treatment of carotid lesions in Germany as well as an early evaluation of quality management as defined by the law. Observance of anonymity and data protection guarantee the validity of the study. The results reported are comparable with those of other major international reports. Overall mortality was 0.7%. Minor and major complications were observed in 12.8% of cases. In comparison with the literature the rate of neurological events (4.5%) was low. The stroke was transitory in 2.9% and permanent in 1.6% of cases. The risk profile of the patient was a more important factor for morbidity and mortality than the operation technique. Patients with high ASA risk scores showed higher mortality, and patients in clinical stages III and IV had higher neurological morbidity.
