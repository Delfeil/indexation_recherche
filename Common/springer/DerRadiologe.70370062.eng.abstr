The sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described. Malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform: initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly hypoechoic lesions can be found. Generally, four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described: diffuse, small nodular, large nodular and bulky type. Secondary, tumor-related or inflammatory complications (e. g. dislocation or compression of vessels, thoracic inlet syndrome, venous thrombosis, ileus, urinary retention, abscess and effusion) can be sonographically evaluated. Response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor-related complications. Differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and, with certain restrictions, on the echogenicity of lesions and perfusion feasible with Doppler sonography. The primary diagnosis has to be established histologically.
