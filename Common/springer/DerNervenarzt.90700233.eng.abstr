Dysmorphophobia as a new psychiatric  syndrome was described by the italian psychiatrist Morselli in 1891. Dysmorphophobic symptoms are associated with several other psychiatric disorders. The term of dysmorphophobia will be discussed along a theoretical review. We present the case of a 20-year-old patient with dysmorphophobic symptoms. In the scope of ICD 10, DSM-III-R/DSM IV diagnostical criteria we outline problems of the diagnostical classification of dysmorphophobic signs.
