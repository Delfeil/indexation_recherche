Mycophenolate mofetil represents a new immunosuppressive drug. Several case reports have shown that mycophenolate mofetil has a good therapeutic effect in patients with psoriasis and autoimmune dermatoses. Mycophenolate mofetil is a morpholine ester of mycophenolic acid which was shown in the 1970s to be effective in patients with severe psoriasis. Mycophenolate mofetil has an increased bioavailability as compared to mycophenolic acid and thereby an improved therapeutic window. Currently, mycophenolate mofetil is indiated for the prevention of organ rejection in transplant patients. The mode of action and the pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil are reviewed and the current clinical experience with this immunosuppressive drug for dermatological disorders is summarized.
