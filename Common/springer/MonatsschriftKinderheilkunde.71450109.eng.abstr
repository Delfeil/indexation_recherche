2 weeks after initiation of carbamazepine therapy a 3 year old boy presented with skin rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and nephritis. After exclusion of infectious diseases our differential diagnosis focussed on carbamazepine induced hypersensitivity syndrome. We found a positive lymphocyte transformation assay and patch test to carbamazepine, indicating a specific response, but no anti-carbamazepine antibody, no circulating immune complexes and no decrease in complement components. The hypersensitivity syndrome refers to a severe hypersensitivity response due to a idiosyncratic reaction. The origin is unknown. The similarity to other multisystem disorders is discussed.
