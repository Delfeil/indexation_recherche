Abstract.  A case of generalized maculopapular rash and local indurated plaques following s.c. injections of either low-molecular-weight heparin or conventional (high-molecular-weight) heparin to a 75-year-old woman is reported. This rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed.
