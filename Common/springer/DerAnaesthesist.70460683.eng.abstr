Objective: The data of 60 postoperatively sedated and ventilated patients were studied for analysis of oesophageal, bladder, and rectal temperatures. The purpose of the investigation was to clarify whether changes of oesophageal temperature are adequately reflected by bladder and rectal temperatures and whether the rate of rewarming has  an influence on the accuracy of the latter two sites.
