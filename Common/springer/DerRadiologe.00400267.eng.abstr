Background: In an interdisciplinary approach, HepaVision (MEVIS, Bremen), a software tool specifically developed for 3D visualization of the liver, was employed for individual planning of extensive liver resections and evaluation of living-relative donations. So far there is experience with more than 50 biphasic spiral CT examinations.
