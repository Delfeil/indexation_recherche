 The influence of a coronary dissection on long-term outcome after PTCA has been controversely discussed in the past. Whereas diverse experimental studies have shown a positive relation between dissection and the incidence of restenosis, clinical trials could not document an influence of dissection on long-term outcome. However, most of the trials did not distinguish between the different morphologic configuration of the vascular dissection. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the influence of dissections on restenosis in regard to their amount and morphologic configuration. The prognostic importance of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute classification on dissection as well as the importance of an additional classification of angiographic complications after PTCA were investigated to determine possible pathophysiologic mechanisms of the restenosis process. The study included 141 consecutive patients with 143 stable dissections after PTCA. A follow-up study was performed 13 months in mean after successful PTCA, which included clinical, symptomatic, and functional aspects of patients. In this patient population, type C dissections (Dorros et al.) showed a relevantly increased risk of a clinical adverse event (41.0%), whereas patients with a type A dissection had only a small risk of an adverse event (10.0%) over the investigation period. Type B dissections revealed an intermediate risk (18.0%), and type D dissections showed a risk of 33.3% of an adverse event, which was lower than that observed for type C dissections. The AC-classification of the postinterventional coronary morphology was a stronger predicter of an adverse outcome after PTCA (p = 0.0003) than was the Dorros-classification (p = 0.0056). Conclusions: The grade of a coronary dissection was highly, positively related to an ischemic event after PTCA using both the Dorros and the AC-classification (p = 0.0056/p = 0.0003). In regard to the special association of the AC-class with the amount of vascular injury, we conclude that the amount and configuration of coronary dissection correlates with the long-term outcome after PTCA.
