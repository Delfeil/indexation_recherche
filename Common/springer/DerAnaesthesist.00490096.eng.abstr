The objective of this review is to describe which hygiene measures are appropriate and necessary in anaesthesia and the ICU and which are not, whereby unnecessary hygiene measures are those which are not substantiated by scientific data. The most effective single infection control measure is still hand disinfection between patient contacts. Unnessecary measures include routine sampling of environmental surfaces, disinfecting the floor in the ICU, protective gowns for visitors, so called in-line filters in the infusion system etc. Ventilator tubes only need to be exchanged once a week, even when no HMEs are used.
