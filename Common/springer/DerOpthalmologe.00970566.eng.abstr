Background. Penetrating keratoplasty in cases of perforated corneal ulcers is a technical challenge. The loss of anterior chamber volume during trephination causes irregularities of surgical margins and carries the risk of trauma to iris and crystalline lens. The highly viscous substance Healon 5 allows a deep anterior chamber to be maintained even in cases of rather large perforations.
