Risk assessment for fetal chromosomal disorders and open neural tube and ventral wall defects was carried out at the Institute of Human Genetics, University of Goettingen, between autumn 1989 and spring 1999. A total of 33 774 pregnancies were routinely examined. Individual risk calculation was based on maternal age related risks and on changes of the concentration of three serum markers (human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein, and unconjugated estriol). Our results confirm the findings of other prospective and retrospective studies concerning the effectiveness of such a biochemical screening. In the examined cohort 54 chromosomal disorders and 27 neural tube or ventral wall defects have been detected by the use of cut-offs that are generally accepted in Germany. In addition, many other fetal disorders and gestational anomalies, for instance intrauterine fetal death, hydrops fetalis and x-linked ichthyosis, have been detected because of atypical changes in serum-marker concentrations. We present our results and furthermore report on experiences that have led to reduction of systematic errors and to improvement of specificity.
