 Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) with hepatic vein occlusion is a rare disorder that can effectively be treated in advanced stages with orthotopic liver transplantation. We report on 16 patients who received 18 liver grafts and were followed up for at least 2 years. In 7 patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. One patient died after 4 months due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia; another patient died after 2 years due to progressive liver failure after portal vein thrombosis. The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 87.5 % compared to 85.3 % in all other 710 orthotopic liver transplantations performed from September 1988 to December 1995 at our institution. Anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin. Three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis, one patient for 1 week only early after the transplantation. Two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy. Two patients had to be retransplanted, one for thrombosis of the hepatic artery and portal vein after discontinuation of dicoumarin due to GI bleeding and one for hepatic vein thrombosis after insufficient dicoumarin intake. Terminal BCS represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation; however, life-long, closely monitored anticoagulation is essential.
