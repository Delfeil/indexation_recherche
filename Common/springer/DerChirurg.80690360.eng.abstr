 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in the Western world as a consequence of the hepatitis C epidemia. Multimodal therapy is now the only effective treatment option to offer a chance of complete tumor control in HCC. Liver transplantation and liver resection, including the selection criteria and patient evaluation, are discussed. The benefits and complications of transarterial chemoembolization and cryotherapy are also reviewed. Liver transplantation is now thought to offer the best treatment option in early HCC and should be regarded as the first line of treatment in selected patients.
