The authors report about a rare case of aortico-right ventricular tunnel. This defect was successfully corrected in a 15-months-old infant. A characteristic continuous murmur was heard over the 3th/4th intercostal space at the left sternal border. Two-dimensional echocardiography and angiography confirmed the diagnosis. If possible, an early corrective operation should be attempted for this defect.
