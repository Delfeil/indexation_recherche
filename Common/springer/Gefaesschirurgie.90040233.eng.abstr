 We report on a case of chylous ascites as a rare complication following elective aortic aneurysm repair in a 66-year-old male. After this complication early development on the second postoperative day, relaparotomy was performed with ligation of fistulas and omentumplasty. After recurrence of chylous ascites, conservative treatment for 3 months, including parenteral nutrition and a low-fat diet under continuous peritoneal drainage, finally led to success.
