X-ray or CT images allow only a limited three-dimensional orientation in presurgical planning. Especially for the planning of internal hemipelvectomies with custom-made endoprosthesis and for periacetabular osteotomies a high-grade orientation is necessary. This orientation is improved by a 3D CT-controlled manufactured 1:1 model of the pelvis. This enables an exact classification of defect and deformity, planning of resection planes, design of the suitable custom-made implant and simulation of the operation technique as preoperative quality control.
