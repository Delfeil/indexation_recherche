 Quality assessment and quality control in medicine is not only required by law but is an inherent necessity for every physician to reflect on the quality of care given to his or her patients. The working group "quality assurance" of the German Interdisciplinary Society of Intensive Care Medicine plans to establish a national registry on the quality of intensive case in order to develop a comprehensive system to control and improve the care given to critically ill patients. The registry is based on an anonymized data set including information about the type and structure of the participating ICU, demographic patient data, information about the course of patient while in the ICU, organ functions and the expenditure required as well as outcome. These data sets will form a national reference which will allow individual ICU to compare themselves with and to implement internal quality improvement measures, if necessary. The common tracer for comparison are incidence, severity and course of organ dysfunctions. The participation in this registry may have several advantages: (1) gain of reliable and independent information about the quality of intensive care provided with regards to mortality and organ failure (effectiveness), (2) gain of information about the expenditure of care in relation to the course of the treatment (efficiency), (3) gain of information that might be used for negotiations with administration, (4) fulfillment of legal requirements and (5) gain of information for public relation.
