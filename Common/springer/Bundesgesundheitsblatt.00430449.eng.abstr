Data for HIV infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality. Estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic, even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk. Extrapolations of data from discordant couple cohort studies and from US seroincidence studies may be seriously biased. Infectivity of and susceptibility to HIV may be influenced by concomitant STDs, antiretroviral therapy, alloimmunization and/or subinfectious virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter- and intraindividual variability. Differences in factors influencing transmission probability of HIV most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of HIV.
