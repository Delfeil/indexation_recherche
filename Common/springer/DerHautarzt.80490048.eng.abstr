Scleredema adultorum of Buschke is a rare disorder of unknown aetiology. It is characterized by diffuse, non-pitting swelling and induration of the skin. Skin biopsies reveal marked thickening of the dermis due to collagenous replacement of the subcutis and deposition of hyaluronic acid between the collagen fibers. The disease classically only affects the skin. In 24 cases an associated monoclonal gammopathy has been detected.
