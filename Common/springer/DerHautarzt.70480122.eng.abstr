Superior vena cava syndrome (VCSS) develops because of a progressive reduction of venous return from the head, neck and the upper extremities. The presenting sign of this relatively rare condition is often a rapidly developing, often massive facial edema. As a consequence, such the patients are often seen initially by a dermatologist. Other clinical characteristics may include cyanotic facial erythema, dilatation of the neck veins, and a prominent venous pattern n the anterior chest. Today, primary lung cancers and other mediastinal tumours represent the most common cause of VCSS, which may take a slowly progressive or a more fulminant course. In these cases, the disease develops rapidly and becomes life-threatening, requiring intensive medial diagnosis and care. We describe three patients with superior vena cava syndrome due to a) bronchogenic carcinoma, b) bihilar sarcoidosis and c) metastasizing malignant melanoma. Since recognition of VCSS broadens the diagnostic spectrum of the dermatologist, an overview on its diagnostic and therapeutic implications is given based on our cases and the literature.
