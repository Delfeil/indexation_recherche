In a prospective study, 35 consecutive patients with an isolated posterior knee instability were stabilized arthroscopically in a new all-inside, double bundle technique using the autologous quadrupled semitendinosus and the doubled gracilis tendon. Femoral fixation of the grafts was performed with two Endobuttons. Out of 24 patients, 20 were evaluated with a follow-up of 25.4 months (12-47) on average; in 15 cases the follow-up was less than 12 months. Only 18 patients could be evaluated because in two cases the grafts had to be removed (one infection, one rupture). The Lysholm score improved from 67.6 points preoperatively to 88.5 points, the Tegner score from 3.9 to 4.9. The corrected posterior drawer measured with the KT-1000 arthrometer was reduced from 9.1 mm to 4.3 mm postoperatively. Preoperatively, 17 patients belonged to group D and one patient to group C in the IKDC overall evaluation form. After stabilization, eight patients were in group B, seven in group C, and three remained in group D. Damage to neurovascular structures in the popliteal area did not occur.
