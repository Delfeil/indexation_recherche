In 1837, Germany's first in-patient dermatological department named "Heilanstalt für Flechtenkranke" was founded by Dr. Albert Friedrich Veiel in the city of Cannstatt (which since 1905 is part of Stuttgart). Later his son, Dr. Theodor Veiel, directed this private dermatological clinic, and became head of the district hospital of Cannstatt in 1881. Although he was active in many areas of medicine, dermatology was his main interest. He very much influenced the development of dermatology during his period as president of the German Dermatology Association until his death in 1923. In 1935, the first dermatological city hospital was established in Cannstatt/Stuttgart. But, after World War II, all the medical facilities were taken over by the US Army. Thus, medical activities including dermatology had to be spread all over Stuttgart, until in 1965 they were returned to their former place. At the end of 1998, the large abandoned US army hospital will home a totally renovated and modernized Stuttgart dermatology hospital.
