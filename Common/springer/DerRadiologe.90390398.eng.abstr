The kidneys of patients with chronic renal failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis may show different variances or complications. Most common are secondarily acquired renal cysts, which may be found in as many as 92% of patients after 8 years of hemodialysis. Single (in 12.5% of patients) or multiple (8.3%) cysts with bleeding are common; additionally, hematuria or ruptured cysts may be found. Bleeding into cysts is more common in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Due to the decreasing urinary production development of kidney stones is very uncommon, but calcifications in or around cysts can be found in 71% of patients. Kidney tumors occur 41 times more often in patients with chronic renal failure than in patients without kidney disease. We detected tumors in 4.2% of our patients on long-term dialysis. Diagnostic differentiation of the relatively slow growing and fairly late metastasizing malignant tumors from adenomas is not possible. Nevertheless, we screen our patients every 3-4 years. Computed tomography is superior to ultrasonography for this purpose, because ultrasonography lacks the necessary sensitivity in this group of patients.
