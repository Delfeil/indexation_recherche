In this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas, the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint, is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium-term outcome in 40 patients treated conservatively and 72 patients treated surgically by arthroscopy. The criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis. The stages on MRI follow the morphology of the interface, i.e., the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone, on T1- and T2-weighted images. After 18 and 24 months there were no substantial differences visible on MRI between the two different treatment groups. In fact, in the majority of cases  (> 60%) the MRI result was the same in spite of the treatment that had been carried out. Arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a reintegration in the sense of upgrading on the MRI (36% to 30%); nevertheless, a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases (4%). In both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis, juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms.
