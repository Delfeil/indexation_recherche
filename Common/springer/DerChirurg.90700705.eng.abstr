 With the help of thick, transparent finger cross sections, it was shown that fibers of the extensor aponeurosis insert distal to the avulsed fragment of the distal phalanx. The consequence for hand surgery is not to expose the fragment through a dorsal incision, but through a mid-lateral one. In this way, the distant parts of the aponeurosis distal to the fracture remain intact, and there is no break in the continuation of the dorsal extension plate.
