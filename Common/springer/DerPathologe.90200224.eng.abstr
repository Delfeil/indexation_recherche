Chondromyxoid fibroma is a rare benign bone tumor, accounting for less than 1% of all bone tumors. The peak age incidence is the second and third decade of life. Chondromyxoid fibrom occurs in the metaphyseal parts of the major tubular bones, predominantly of the lower extremity. Roentgenograms show, in most cases, a well-demarcated radiolucent lesion. The classic histological feature of a chondromyxoid fibroma is stellate or spindle-shaped cells arranged in lobules in a myxoid or chondroid background. Analysis of 40 chondromyxoid fibromas demonstrates the morphological variation of this tumor. Cases were examined for age distribution, localization, and radiological and histological features. In 85% we found the typical histomorphological pattern. Recurrence rate was 12.5%. In four cases the appearance was uncharacteristic and differentiation from other tumors such as chondroblastoma or chondrosarcoma was quite difficult. By adhering to strict histomorphological criteria, definite diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma can be made in most cases.
