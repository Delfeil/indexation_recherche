 In the pathogenesis of chronic venous insufficiency dynamic venous hypertension is crucial. The causes are changes in the venous blood flow. We differentiate between retrograde and antegrade flow insufficiency. The retrograde type is seen in cases of loss of the valve system in postthrombotic syndrome with complete recanalization, or in congenital malformations. The antegrade type is found in various diseases. Antegrade and retrograde pressphlebography in combination with duplex imaging is suitable for diagnostic purposes. Knowledge of the pathologic conditions facilitates decisions concerning surgical treatment in chronic venous insufficiency.
