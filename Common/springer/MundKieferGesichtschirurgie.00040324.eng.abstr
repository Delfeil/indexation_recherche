Problem: During most surgeries, tissues are coagulated by a high-frequency current in order to stop the bleeding. Usually, bipolar forceps are used for this procedure. Until now it could not be avoided, however, that the biotissue would adhere to the forceps ends making hemostasis more difficult to achieve. Can this negative effect possibly be avoided? Material and method: A newly developed bipolar irrigation forceps spilling out a 0.9% sodium chloride solution during the coagulation process has been designed to avoid this disadvantage. The irrigation forceps has been tested and evaluated experimentally in surgery as well as clinically. Results: The irrigation liquid selected is a 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Thermal imaging during biotissue coagulation has shown that the tissue heats up more and faster with flushed coagulation, and that the tip of the forceps heats up less than with unirrigated coagulation. In both experimental-surgical as well as in clinical tests it was possible to stop the biotissue sticking to the ends of the forceps. This effect was also confirmed histologically. Conclusion: Since other methods of avoiding the sticking effect during tissue coagulation by a high-frequency current have not been successful until now, the bipolar irrigation electrode is a promising new development. It helps the surgeon to work more efficiently and safely without having to adapt to big changes, and, at the same time, it reduces the risk of complications.
