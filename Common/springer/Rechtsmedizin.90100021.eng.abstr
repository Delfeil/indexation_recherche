 Urine specimens were collected from 49 persons up to 10 days after abstaining from cannabis use. Urine samples (n = 135) were investigated for free and conjugated 9-carboxy-11-nor tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) by LC/MS/MS and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) by GC/MS prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis. Concentrations for free and conjugated THCCOOH were measured with reference to 100 mg creatinine/dL urine. Cannabis use was classified as light, moderate and heavy according to the current literature. In all groups chosen free and bound THCCOOH was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day. Urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of THCCOOH and THCCOOH glucuronide. Within 4-6 days the concentrations of free and glucuronidated THCCOOH in urine samples of heavy users decreased to those ranges present in urine samples of moderate and light users. In frequent users, THC glucuronide and 11-OH-THC glucuronide could be found up to 1 and 3 days after abstinence, respectively. In light users, neither THC glucuronide nor 11-OH-THC glucuronide was detectable. The determination of conjugated THC and 11-OH-THC in addition to free and bound THCCOOH is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use, but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption.
