Introduction: Laser systems are frequently used in dentistry. New laser scanner technologies are promising more homogeneous ablation of pathological ablations of the skin and mucosa. The theoretical advantages of these systems have not yet been sufficiently evaluated by histological findings. For this reason, we compared two laser scanners with different scanning patterns in this study (Silktouch and Swiftlase, by Sharplan, Germany). Materials and Methods: In this animal study  (79 male Osborn-Mendel rats), skin defects of 3-mm diameter were lasered on to the backs of the animals, one for each method mentioned above (defocused laser, Swiftlase, and Silktouch). The histological investigations were conducted, depending on the time after surgery  (9 h, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, or 13 days). On the clinical site, we evaluated the visible ablation rate, homogeneity and morphology of the wound surface and the degree of  carbonization. In the histomorphological investigations, we determined the degree of thermal damage as well as the morphology of the necrotic area and reepithelization pattern of the surface. Results: The Silktouch scanner clinically showed a homogeneous ablation rate with less carbonization than the Swiftlase scanner. In the histological specimen, this correlated with an increase in the tissue ablation rate and decreasing thermal damage to the surrounding tissue. Especially in the early wound-healing period, there was a more rapid reepithelization after the use of the Silktouch scanner. These differences could not be evaluated in the later wound-healing period. Compared to the defocused laser ablation, both scanning systems seem to have benefits within these parameters. Conclusions: The results of this study seem to show a diminished perifocal damage and reduced clinical postoperative morbidity achieved by using laser scanning systems. Compared to the Swiftlase laser, the Silktouch seems to deliver better results.
