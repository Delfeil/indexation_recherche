Calciphylaxis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication in chronic renal failure. It is characterized by ischemic tissue necrosis primarily of the skin. The typical histopathologic finding is microvascular calcification with endovascular fibrosis. Patients typically present with violaceous, mottled and painful lesions which tend to progress to non-healing ulcers and necrosis. Most frequently the lower extremities are involved in a symmetric fashion but the trunk may also be affected. Sepsis from superinfection of the lesions accounts for the high mortality of this disease which is of importance for dermatologists and nephrologists alike. 61-year-old female patient developed lesions of calciphylaxis on both calves two years after beginning hemodialysis to treat renal failure due to diabetic glomerulosclerosis. We discuss aspects of the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis, as well as diagnosis, treatment and means of preventions, and review the current literature.
