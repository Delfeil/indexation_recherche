In an experimental study, the biomechanical qualities of the combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO) in the unstable Colles' fracture were analyzed. This type of pin fixation is our preferred osteosynthesis in the treatment of unstable Colles' fracture because it allows immediate functional therapy. It represents a modification of Kapandji's dynamic KWO, compensating for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static KWO. Clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results, was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined KWO and its single components should be constituted. Simulation of the unstable Colles' fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material. This fracture model was subsequently pinned using the different KWO types and tested by a standardized vector energy testing device regarding its stability in the four main loading directions. The combined KWO unifies the advantage of volar stability of the conventional KWO with the high dorsal stability of dynamic KWO. The main functional principle of dynamic KWO with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission. Besides its good stabilization, dynamic KWO also leads to optimal alignment of the distal metaphyseal fragment. Furthermore, the experiments yielded important information about technical aspects of the surgical procedure, which helps us to avoid anatomical and functional deficiencies. Based on these experimental findings, the surgical technique of combined KWO was standardized.
