Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a consequence of vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency and in the majority of cases due to alcoholism. We report here the case of a 26-year-old male alcoholic who had stayed helplessly at home for 4 days until hospital admission. Clinical diagnosis was difficult due to major disturbance of consciousness. MRI showed an increase in signal intensity (T2-, FLAIR-weighted) around the third ventricle, the quadrigeminal bodies, the fornices, the mamillary bodies, the floor of the fourth ventricle and around the aqueduct. These findings were indicative of WE although of unusual extent. In this case MRI correlated well with clinical symptomatology. Therapy with thiamine was started immediately and symptoms as well as MRI findings resolved partially. The presented case illustrates the diagnostic usefulness of MRI in WE especially if the patient is of reduced consciousness and clinical investigation is limited.
