 Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common nerve compression syndromes. Nocturnal paresthesia and pain are early symptoms, and hypesthesia and thenar atrophy are late symptoms. These days endoscopic and open operation techniques are available. Minimal trauma after endoscopic release allows early return to work. The endoscopic technique should be performed by experienced surgeons to avoid severe complications.
