 This article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines, automatic teller machines (ATMs) and telephone cards by the elderly in four European regions. The analyses are based on data from an international project entitled "Keeping the Elderly Mobile", collected in Mannheim (former West Germany; N=404 home-dwelling respondents), Chemnitz (former East Germany; N=400), Ancona (Italy; N=600), and Jyväskylä (Finland; N=618). The random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country. Two generations of men and women (aged 55-74 and 75+ years, respectively) participated in the study. Results show that respondents generally made little use of the three technologies under investigation: in fact, the majority of respondents does not use them at all. The most frequently used devices were ATMs in Chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in Mannheim. On the basis of logistic regression analysis, age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions, i.e., the users were mostly the "young-old." Education was a more important variable than gender. In all four regions, the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier; nevertheless, ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in Mannheim. Interesting differences and similarities among the towns were also found. The present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth.
