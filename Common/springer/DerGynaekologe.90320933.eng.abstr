A differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis, patient information on avoidance of known dangers, and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected. If no information is given on the risks inherent in a patient's condition and how she must proceed in order to ensure that they do not come about, this is considered to be a treatment error, and in these circumstances the intervention is then legally seen as bodily harm. Information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time, which generally means on the day before the operation. An exception is made to this rule for day surgery. The patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind. Such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions. In the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information [and making decisions]. In the case of unconscious patients everything depends on "presumable consent to the operation". If a patient later cites lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be unwise to refuse an operation, she must elaborate plausible grounds for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information.
