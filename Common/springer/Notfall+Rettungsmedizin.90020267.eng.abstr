Prehospital thrombolysis is often recommended for patients in whom a major time gain of >90 min compared to in-hospital therapy is expected. It has been repeatedly shown by metropolitan rescue services that very early presentation after onset of symptoms in a high percentage of patients offers an additional chance for optimizing thrombolytic therapy. More than half of all patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction to the EMS may be treated within 90 min after symptom onset, enabling preservation of major myocardial areas at risk. Thus, prehospital thrombolysis in metropolitan areas offers a chance to take advantage of an ideal time window, without additional risk. Moreover, technical and diagnostic preconditions are easily fulfilled.
