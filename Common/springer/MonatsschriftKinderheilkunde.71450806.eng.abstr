This report presents two patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome of different severity. The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is an autosomal recessively inherited metabolic disorder characterized by failure to thrive, neurologic dysfunction, facial dysmorphism, skeletal and organ malformations. Recently, the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome was shown to be due to an inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis diagnosable by markedly elevated levels of serum 7-dehydrocholesterol. There is a wide variability in the clinical presentation and some patients may present with only mild abnormalities. Discussion: The possibility of the diagnosis of a Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with failure to thrive and developmental retardation.
