The classic operation for treatment of a truncal varicosity affecting the long saphenous vein consists in resection of the region where the saphenous and the iliac and epigastric vessels come together and complete or partial removal of the vascular trunk. The Babcock technique is used for stage IV and for secondary truncal varicosity in the postthrombotic syndrome, while partial resection is reserved for stages I-III up to the distal point of insufficiency. In suitable cases the invagination method and cryoresection are optimal alternatives to stripping. In contrast, the Moszkowicz operation is hardly used any more because of the dangers of relapse and of phlebothrombosis. The Chiva method never became established in Germany: it is based ultimately on Trendelenberg's concept of surgery, which was abandoned almost 100 years ago. Even if an external valvuloplasty is used the varicose trunk of the vein is left in place, and the result of the procedure should still be checked by means of phlebographic documentation and by monitoring of the long-term results. Intraluminal coagulation with radiowave energy combined with resection of the junction of the saphenous and epigastric vessels seems to promise an extension of the spectrum of methods available, but wide experience of its application is still lacking.
