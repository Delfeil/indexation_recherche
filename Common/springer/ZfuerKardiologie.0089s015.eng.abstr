 Coronary angiography remains the diagnostic standard for establishing the presence, site, and severity of coronary artery disease. Electron beam computed tomography (EBCT), a non-invasive imaging method with very high spatial and temporal resolution, is well suited for cardiac imaging. Using a standard protocol, EBCT permits the visualization of the coronary arteries. Stenoses and occlusions of the native arteries and of coronary artery bypass grafts can be reliably diagnosed. Extremely calcified segments have to be excluded from evaluation. Reduced image quality, mainly due to fast vessel motion and superposition of large veins, impairs the results obtained for the right and left circumflex coronary artery. Possible clinical applications are the follow-up after angioplasty (PTCA without stent) and bypass surgery, the exclusion of coronary artery disease in patients with low likelihood of disease, and the evaluation of coronary anomalies.
