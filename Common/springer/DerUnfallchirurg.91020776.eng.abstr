The dislocation fracture of the femoral head is the result of high speed trauma. Most of the patients have additional injuries. The prognosis of this kind of fracture of the femoral head depends on the type of fracture, the additional injuries and the age of the patients. The diagnosis and the specific treatment are most important, since most of the patients with this injury are of a younger age. The reposition of the fracture has to be performed within 6 hours. In our opinion, this should be done by surgery if possible. For the operation some routine pelvic X-rays and a CT of the pelvis should be prepared. The therapy depends on the type of fracture. In patients with Type I and II fractures the broken head fragments should be refixed by only taking out small parts of bone which are not elementary for the pressure zone of the femoral head. Younger patients with Type III fractures should always receive the possibility of a screw fixation of the neck of femur, whereas total hip replacement should generally be achieved in the older patient. An exact reconstruction of the dorsal acetabulum must be performed in Pipkin Type IV fractures. The usual approach for Type I-III fractures is the ventrolateral Smith-Peterson and lateral Watson-Jones, for Type IV fractures, the dorsal Kocher-Langenbeck approach. We suggest indometacine as a prophylaxis for ossifications due to high tissue damage. Several scores for the evaluation and documentation of the outcome of this kind of fracture are useful: the clinical results according to Merle d'Aubigne, social status scored by the Karnofsky Index and X-ray results using Brooker and Helfet to classify the heterotopic ossification and post traumatic joint changes.
