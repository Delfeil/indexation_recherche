As shown in acute adult knee trauma, not all injuries can be evaluated in the first clinical examination. Only through arthroscopy can the additional findings that were first overlooked become evident. In knee trauma in children, the clinical diagnosis is also often inaccurate. Nevertheless, arthroscopy is accepted only with hesitation, despite the fact that as early as in the 1980s the problem of accuracy in clinical knee examinations after acute trauma in children was addressed by several authors and arthroscopy advised to improve the diagnostic results. In two groups of children and adolescents with unclosed growth plates, a study comparing the years 1985 to 1988 and 1987 to 1996 was performed. The patients were selected from our hospital. The age was 6 to 15 years. In these patients the discrepancy between clinical examination and arthroscopical data could be demonstrated. Regarding the two groups, 45% and 36%, respectively, showed different findings in clinical and arthroscopic investigations. Isolated as well as combined lesions often could only be identified through arthroscopy. The main finding were interligamentary anterior cruciate ligament lesions, medial collateral ligament injuries and meniscal lesions. Patella luxations with retinaculum ruptures and osteochondral flakes not seen in clinical investigation were found through arthroscopy. Hemarthrosis was the most decisive predictor in severity of injury. Despite modern imaging techniques such as MRI, arthroscopy is exceptionally significant because it is simultaneously a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. This more and more established conclusion should lead to further incorporation of arthroscopy in the managment of acute knee trauma in both children and adolescents.
