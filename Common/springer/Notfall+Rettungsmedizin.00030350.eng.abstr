Acute dyspnoea is one of the most common paediatric emergencies in practice. Due to the anatomy and small diameter of children's airways, all mechanisms, which cause a narrowing of the airway (mucus membrane swelling, mucus plug, foreign body, external compression), more easily lead to a significant breathing barrier than in adults. In preclinical emergency management the differentiation of the pathological breathing sounds (in- or exspiratory stridor, wheezing) is a very important diagnostic tool and together with the age of the child the most important guideline for the correct diagnosis and therapeutic measures. The most common causes for acute stridor are Croup-syndrom, foreign body aspiration and epiglottitis, for wheezing the acute bronchial obstruction caused by an allergic or infectious agent. Besides that there are other rare causes of stridor and wheezing which however cannot be differentiated in the preclinical setting. It has to be considered that the conscious child with acute dyspnoea is to be handled with extreme caution in order not to cause respiratory failure due to agitation. The most important diseases, which lead to acute dyspnoea, their symptoms and therapeutic emergency management as well as important differential diagnoses are discussed.
