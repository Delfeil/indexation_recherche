 Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of a varicosed long and/or short saphenous vein. The initial extent and progression of the ascending varicophlebitis can be determined, either by duplex scanning or phlebography. By ascending, an extensive thrombus can enter the deep veins through the respective junctional valve (in the groin or at the knee) or via insufficient perforating veins. In view of pulmonary embolism as a possible complication, a clinically relevant classification of this syndrome appears useful. Stage I includes varicophlebitis without involvement of the respective junctional valve or deep veins. In stage II, the cranial portion of the thrombus has reached the respective junctional valves of the long or short shapenous vein. In stage III, the thrombus has entered the deep veins via these valves. In stage IV, the thrombus has reached the deep system via insufficient perforating veins. Stages I and IV should be treated conservatively, and the varicous veins should not be excised until after the acute phase. Stage II and III should be considered an indication for immediate surgery. The surgical strategy consists of crossectomy, resection of the saphenous vein without stripping, radical excision of all varicous veins and ligature of insufficient perforating veins. In stage III, the thrombectomy of the deep veins using the Fogarthy procedure must be carried out before any other measures are taken. The surgical strategy is similar for the short saphenous vein. In stage I disease, early surgery to alleviate local pain and infection, thus hindering recurrence and decreasing morbidity, should be considered.
