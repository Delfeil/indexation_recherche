The basic forms of therapy that can be applied in the treatment of advanced stages of carcinoma of the cervix are surgery and radiotherapy. While stage 1b ist treated by surgical operation, such as the extended radical operation after Wertheim and systematic lymphadenectomy after Meigs, in the vast majority of cases throughout the world, in the case of larger cervical tumours (>4 cm/1b2) and in stage IIb, with extension of the carcinoma into the parametrium, radiotherapy is mostly used. Data on tumour spread from the cervix by way of the parametrium into the pelvic lymph nodes show that prognostic factors allowing for an assessment of the individual patient's chances cannot be elaborated except on the basis of the histopathological investigation of the tissue resected during the radical operation. The 5-year survival rates show that the extended radical abdominal operation combined with radical pelvic lymphadenectomy, when performed in centres where there is special training and especially in the case of advanced tumours of the cervix (FIGO stages lb2/IIb) and involved pelvic and/or para-aortal lymph nodes in the first ray, can yield results that are comparable to or even better than those of resection.
