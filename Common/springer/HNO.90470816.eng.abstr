Bilateral glomus jugulare tumors are rare. However, their treatment should preserve not only the function of the facial nerve but also the caudal cranial nerves and the middle ears in order to avoid bilateral hearing losses. Further, venous cerebral drainage has to be ensured in order to avoid cerebral hypertension and hemorrhagic infarction after bilateral jugular ligations. In the case presented bilateral glomus jugulare tumors required super-selective angiography and embolization. Complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid-transcervical approach without any further functional deteriorations. Middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus. As the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery, venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein. A sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side.
