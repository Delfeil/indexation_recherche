The vast body of knowledge on interleukin-7 (IL-7) that has accumulated over the last few years, i.e. since its discovery in 1988, is of increasing relevance for dermatologists. Because of its particular immunological effects, IL-7 is of particular interest in two areas of dermatology. First, IL-7 can be a valuable addition to immunotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of malignant melanoma. A first pilot study of IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumour cells in the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore currently being initiated by the authors. Then, keratinocytes are efficient IL-7-secreting cells and there is evidence that IL-7 can modulate the presence and proliferation of normal and malignant lymphopoietic cells in the dermis. In addition, IL-7 is presently the most potent growth factor for in vitro cultivation of Sézary cells and for the establishment of Sézary cell lines. This report reviews molecular, immunological and preclinical properties of IL-7, with special reference to the possible therapeutic efficacy of this cytokine in dermatology.
