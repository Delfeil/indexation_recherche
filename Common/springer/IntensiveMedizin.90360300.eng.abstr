 A 46 year old woman suffered from a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a "giant" aneurysm of the right internal carotid artery which was followed by acute circulatory insufficiency with left heart failure. It was not possible to restore stable blood pressure in spite of therapy with different catecholamines and invasive cardiocirculatory monitoring, until the use of the phosphodiesterase-inhibitor enoximon achieved a significant increase of cardiac output and an improvement of the hemodynamic parameters. Because of the infraclinoidal position of the aneurysm, endovascular treatment was favored, but could not be performed because of a lethal rebleeding on day 19 of the primary event. In neurogenic caused left heart failure, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors may improve cardiac output and consecutive cerebral perfusion pressure.
