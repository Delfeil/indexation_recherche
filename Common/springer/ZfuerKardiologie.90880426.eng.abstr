  The discrimination of supraventricular versus ventricular tachycardias by an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is still a remaining clinical problem. The false positive detection of supraventricular as ventricular tachycardias causes inadequate electrical therapies of the ICD. To improve the increase of specificity criterias like "Onset" or "Stability" are offered. If these criterias during tachycardia are not fulfilled, the " sustained rate duration" (SRD) is offered as a security criterion. The SRD reasons the delivery of the therapy during tachycardia after a programmable time.
