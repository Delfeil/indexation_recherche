 Post-traumatic deformities do occur as a result of disturbed fracture healing with loss of bone stock, necrosis of fragments or the development of pseudarthrosis resulting in malunion or progressive malalignment. In the majority of the cases these disturbances can be related to technical problems of primary fracture treatment like insufficient reduction or implant failure. On the other hand, complex deformities with involvement of the adjacent joints may also be a result of injuries of the growth plate in childhood. In some cases primary correction is impossible because of critical conditions of the bone and the soft tissue envelope in the center of deformation. If a secondary correction is indicated, knowledge of all reconstructive techniques is essential to choose the appropriate method and carry out successful and exact correction of malalignment of the affected limb after detailed planning.
