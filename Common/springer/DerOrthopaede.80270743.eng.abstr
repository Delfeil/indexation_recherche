The periacetabular osteotomy is a strategy for the treatment of residual hip dysplasia in young adults with the aim of preventing secondary coxarthrosis. This polygonal, juxta-articular osteotomy respects the vascular blood supply to the acetabular fragment and thus facilitates an extensive acetabular reorientation with improvement of the insufficient coverage of the femoral head, including medial displacement of the fragment. All osteotomies are performed by one approach, the modified Smith-Petersen, which allows an anterior capsulotomy. Inspection of the joint not only provides information on acetabular rim pathologies, but also facilitates the control of impingement-free range of motion after the correction. The posterior column remains partially intact, allowing minimal internal fixation of the acetabular fragment and early mobilization similar to that after an intertrochanteric osteotomy. The dimensions of the true pelvis are unchanged, providing the capacity to have an unimpeded delivery in women. This paper describes the preoperative evaluation, current indications, surgical technique, postoperative care, and the results of this osteotomy.
