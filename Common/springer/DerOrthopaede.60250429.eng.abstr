Epi-metaphyseal pseudarthroses are rare. They occur in about 1 % of cases after osteosynthesis and osteotomies and may cause deviation as well as painful limitation of motion and instability. Several different treatment methods can be advocated, including decortication and bridging of bone and articular defects, stable osteosynthesis and arthroplasty to regain motion. In selected cases endoprosthetic replacement can be a reliable procedure instead of an arthrodesis.
