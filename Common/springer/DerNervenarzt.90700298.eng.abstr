Neurocysticercosis, caused by Taenia solium larvae (cysticerci), is the most common parasitic infection of the human CNS Worldwide. In Germany its appearance is rare. Here we report two cases of neurocysticercosis which we followed over a period of 4-6 years. The first patient acquired neurocysticercosis in Germany. On admission he suffered from papilledema, partial seizures and a mild psychotic disorder. MR-tomography showed an internal hydrocephalus and multiple contrast enhancing parenchymal cysts. In the course of the disease a giant cyst within the left temporal pole developed and was exstirpated neurosurgically. The persistent internal hydrocephalus required ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Therapy with Praziquantel led to a clinical improvement, however, repeated analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid documented peristent inflammation. With the aid of a contrast enhanced three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging technique we demonstrated increased cerebral perfusion surrounding one cyst. This may be interpreted as evidence for persistent disease activity. The second patient presented with repeated episodes of cysticercotic encephalitis, which is rarely described in the literature (incidence 1%). Clinical features, laboratory findings, diagnosis, and therapy of neurocysticercosis will be presented together with the pitfalls of the two described cases. Our cases will be compared to previous reports on clinical findings in neurocysticercosis.
