Due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques. High flow phases for wash-in or wash-out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short, the difference between the volatile's concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small, and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia. The monitoring, required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients, corresponds to the current obliging technical safety standards. As compound A may accumulate in the breathing system, sevoflurane should not be administered with fresh gas flows lower than 1.0 l/min, until the scientific discussion on nephrotoxicity of this substance in humans is solved. Low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash-out of trace gases. Thoroughly the use of sevoflurane with dry soda lime must be avoided, as this volatile in an extreme exothermic reaction is absorbed nearly totally and degraded to a considerable degree by dry carbon dioxide absorbent. The gaseous degradation products are pungent and possibly may be harmful to the patients. Only by low flow anaesthesia the use of sevoflurane will gain an economically and ecologically acceptable range of efficiency.
