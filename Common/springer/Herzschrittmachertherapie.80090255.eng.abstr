 Elderly patients with known episodes of atrial arrhythmia and indication to pacemaker therapy are borderline cases relative to selection of ventricular single-chamber or dual-chamber pacemaker. The frequency of recurrence of arrhythmic episodes under dual-chamber pacemaker therapy is there the most important criterion.  The differences between patients prone to paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter) and patients without atrial tachyarrhythmia in their medical history were investigated. Frequency of recurrence of atrial fibrillation/flutter and the rate of successful therapy after implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker were studied.  The long-term history of 39 patients with known intermittent or durably successfully treated episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter was compared with 24 patients with new atrial tachyarrhythmia after pacemaker implantation. There was no significant difference in the frequency of recurrence and in therapy efficiency of atrial tachyarrhythmia between both groups.  The results show the benefit of implanting a dual chamber pacemaker also for patients with a known history of atrial tachyarrhythmia. It therefore, should be postulated for therapy of those patients.
