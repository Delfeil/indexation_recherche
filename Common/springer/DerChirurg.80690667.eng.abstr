 Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare and potentially fatal infection of the fascia and subcutaneous tissue. We found only few reports about this disease following laparoscopic surgery. A contamination of the abdominal wall at the trocar position with pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in an "aerosol" is discussed. An increased incidence is associated with risk factors which lead to compromised tissue perfusion and immunosuppression. Early recognition and aggressive surgical management combined with intravenous antibiotics are crucial to a successful outcome. Various aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy of this severe complication following laparoscopic cholecystectomy are discusses.
