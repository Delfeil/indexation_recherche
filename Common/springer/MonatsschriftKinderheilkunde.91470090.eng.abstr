Dysfunctions: Three factors can be considered as basis of the neurobiology of nocturnal enuresis: (1) dysfunction of mesopontine reticular neuronal systems with the consequence of inadequate inhibitory mechanisms for functional subcortical bladder control (developmental delay of afferent pathways or subcortical control mechanisms); (2) arousal-dysfunction, i.e. an absent or inadequate arousal response to bladder distention with the consequence that the child does not awake despite of its full bladder (developmental delay of the arousal system); and (3) dysfunction of the normal circadian rhythm of vasopressin secretion, i.e. an inadequate nocturnal increase of the level of this hormone hormone's level with following excessive nocturnal urine production.
