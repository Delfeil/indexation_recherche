Heated humidifiers (HH) as well as heat and moisture exchangers (HME) are commonly used in intubated patients as air-conditioning devices to raise the moisture content of the air, thus preventing mucosal damage and heat loss resulting from ventilation with dry inspired gases. In contrary to HME, HH are able to add heat and moisture to the inspired air in surplus, which is often stressed as an advantage in warming hypothermic patients or reducing major heat losses, e.g., during long operations. The impact of air conditioning on the energy balance of man was calculated comparing HME and HH.
