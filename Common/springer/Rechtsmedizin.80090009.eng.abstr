 In order to investigate the question how long (in cm) is the muzzle flash from shots fired with starter's pistols loaded with blank cartridges, 26 different starter's pistols of all calibres available were tested. The shots were performed in a dark room in front of a camera with an open shutter. The photographic flash was triggered acoustically by a self-constructed trigger and 10 shots were fired with each gun. The evaluation of the length of the muzzle flash was done by means of a ruler. The experiments showed that the length of the muzzle flash is dependent on the length of the barrel and the construction of the inside of the barrel (starter's pistols have small obstacles inside the barrels, so that no live ammunition can be fired with them). The more propellant the cartridges contained and the shorter the barrels, the more intensive and long was the muzzle flash. The length of the muzzle flash varied from 5-28 cm. The experimental method is described in detail. The possibilities of thermal injuries to the body surface as well as the damage to textiles will be discussed. The different reactions of thermostabile natural fibres (e.g. wool) and thermoplastic synthetic fibres (e.g. polyester) are pointed out.
