Treatment of pain is an medical operation that requires informed consent of the patient as justification. Invasive treatment of pain causes frequently civil and sometimes even criminal responsability of the physician which can be reduced by detailed information about typical risks. Information about abuse, physical and psychological dependence and consequences on the ability to operate a vehicle must be a part of a medicinal treatment. In any treatment, the patient has a right to information about serious alternativemethods. It is the responsibility of the physician to inform the patient in a personal dialogue. Information forms can support but not replace the dialogue. In case of minority of the patient or missing expression of will the physician has to inform the legal representative(s) or to search for the presumed will of the patient. The information  about post operative treatment should take place before the operation to keep the patients consent free of influence of anasthesia or pain caused by the operation. Treatment of pain is often not vital and additional to treatment of the basic desease, so that the physician has to inform both about the treatment of pain and of basic desease. Even by final desease a renunciation of information is possible only under very restricted circumstances. Documentation has to be a part of any information to avoid lack of evidence in a trial.
