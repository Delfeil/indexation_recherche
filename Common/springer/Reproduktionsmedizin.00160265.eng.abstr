This article presents the heuristics concerning description of individual generative behavior. The aim is to describe the development of the desire for children, the generative action and the dealing with generative decisions for intended and unintended childless women and men as well as parents. The main emphasis of the existing heuristics is placed on psychological questions. These heuristics explain patterns and influencing factors of generative action as well as positive and negative influencing factors of the coping process. It may be helpful to use heuristics which describe development of and coping with generative action as background information to ensure comprehensive consultation and therapy planning.
