The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the late result after operative treatment of acute thoracolumbar fractures and fracture dislocations. 29 patients, treated between 1988 and 1995 at the Department of Trauma Surgery, Hannover Medical School with posterior stabilization and interbody fusion with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting, were reexamined 3 1/2 years after surgery. The incorporation and effect on the fusion was analyzed with spiral CT scan after implant removal and the patients were seen for clinical and conventional radiologic examination. We treated 24 type A, 4 type B and 1 type C lesion according to the Magerl classification. 27 patients were stabilized with an internal fixator, 2 with a plate system. The mean operative time totalled 2:50 hours, the intraoperative fluoroscopy time averaged 4:07 minutes and a mean blood loss counted 376 ml. 4 patients out of 6 with an incomplete neurologic lesion (Frankel/ASIA D) improved to Frankel/ASIA grade E. 2 complications were observed: 1 delayed wound healing and 1 venous thrombosis with secondary pulmonary embolism. Compared to the preoperative status our follow-up examinations demonstrated permanent social sequelae: The percentage of individuals able to do physical labor was reduced (15 to 5 patients; p < 0.01) whereas the share of unemployed or retired patients increased (2 to 12 patients; p < 0.01). The assessment of complaints and functional outcome with the "Hannover Spinal Trauma Score" reflected a significant difference (p < 0.001) between the status before injury (96.6/100 points) and at the time of follow-up (64.4/100 points). The correlation between the "Hannover Spinal Trauma Score" and the finger-ground-distance was found to be significant (Coefficient rSpearman = -0.71; p < 0.01).
