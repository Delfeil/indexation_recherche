 A 35-year-old man with known hyperthyroidism because of a toxic multinodular goiter developed thyrotoxic crisis with various organ failures. Antithyroidal drug-treatment was stopped two weeks prior to admission under the assumption of drug induced thrombozytopenia. Iodine exposure could be excluded. Laboratory findings showed elevated thyroid hormone levels (TT3 7.39 nmol/l, TT4 192.5 nmol/l, TSH-basal 0.00 U/l). Additional findings were thrombozytopenia (32000/nl), hyponatriaemia (131 mmol/l), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (Quick 14%, PTT 113 s, ATIII 78%, fibrin degradation products >40 µg/ml). Chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema; the ECG showed atrial fibrillation (ventricular rate 180/min). In this instable clinical situation, the patient underwent emergency subtotal thyroidectomy (near total resection) 12 h after resuscitation. After the thyreoidectomy, the clinical situation quickly improved; thyroid hormon levels normalized. Four days after surgery, intravenous L-thyroxine substitution was necessary (100 µg L-thyroxine i.v./24 h). After two weeks of hemodialysis, the kidney function was restored. Eight weeks later the patient was dismissed with the treatment of 150 µg L-thyroxine per day. Thyrotoxic crisis is a rare, life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism. The important characteristic is not the thyroid blood hormone level, but the life-threatening situation for the patient. Thyrotoxic crisis may be one reason for hyperdynamic shock. Thrombozytopenia is a common side effect in thyrotoxic crisis. Emergency subtotal thyreoidectomy within the first 48 h is considered to be the best method to control the crisis.
