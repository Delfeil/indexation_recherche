Chronic primary headache has a considerable impact on the quality of life. To date, this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life. Headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the German language. In America, a headache specific questionnaire, the "Headache Disability Inventory" (HDI), has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a German version, the "Inventar zur Beeinträchtigung durch Kopfschmerzen" (IBK). 94 consecutive patients with a primary headache disorder (59 female, 35 male; mean age 40 +/- 12 years) were examined. Cronbach's alpha was a=0.90, the test-retest-reliability after three months was r=0.87. An analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test-retest-reliability of these subscales. The scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly. In post-hoc-analyses, however, cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales. The total score of the IBK was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month (r=0.41; p<0.0003) but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters. The IBK is the first German headache specific measurement of certain aspects of the quality of life in chronic headache patients. It can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies.
