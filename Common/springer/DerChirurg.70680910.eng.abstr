 In a prospective randomized study on 50 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, the safety and feasibility of open access laparoscopy was analyzed and compared to the closed Veress needle technique. Open access laparoscopic surgery was performed in half the time needed for the Veress needle technique with equal safety and without complications or technical disadvantages. Furthermore, open access offers economical advantages, as disposable trocars are no longer needed. Therefore the open access technique is recommended as the standard for laparoscopic operations.
