Objectives: We performed 52 peripheral nerve stimulation procedures since 1991. In addition to 48 patients with CRPS II, 4 patients with phantom-limb pain were treated. Incomplete or complete lesion of the stimulated peripheral nerves was determined in all patients. Surgically treatment failed in all cases. All patients had been given extensive conservative pain therapy.
