Numerous epidemiological studies about multiple trauma patients do not include an analysis of patients under the age of 18. To study this, the data of 682 patients with multiple traumata, treated between 1981 and 1991 at Hannover Medical School, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into four age-related groups: preschool age (< 6 years), school age (< 13 years), teenagers (< 18 years) and adults (L 18 years). Analyzed were the cause of trauma, localization of injuries and the cause of death. Children were less often injured as passengers in cars, but more often injured as pedestrians and bicyclists than adults. However, children showed a significant higher mortality than adults, with threefold increased risk of death when they injured as passengers in car accidents. In all groups injuries to the head and the legs were most common. Children showed a lower incidence of trauma to the thorax, abdomen, hip and arms than the adult group. Nevertheless, trauma to the thorax, abdomen and head was associated with the highest risk of death in all groups. Spinal cord injuries, especially injuries to the neck, also showed a high risk of death. Children younger than 6 years had the most severe head injuries. Safety improvements for children in cars, helmet usage on bicycles and early training in traffic safety for children might decrease the lethality in this group of trauma patients.
