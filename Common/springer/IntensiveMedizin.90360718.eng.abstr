 We report three cases of Jimson weed poisoning that we treated at an intermediate care ward. All three patients ingested the poison intentionally to experience a state of euphoria/hallucinations. Clinically, the central symptoms of the anticholinergic syndrome were the most striking features. The patients' symptoms were characterized by disorientation, hallucinations, and helplessness. Two of the three patients we treated with the antidote Physostigmine. In spite of its short half-life, repeated injections were not necessary. Plants, containing Tropa-alcaloids like Jimson weed and Angel's trumpet are easy to find when in season and have been known as hallucinogenic drugs for long time. The dosage is hard to assess, because of various concentrations in the different parts of the plants. It is easy to recognize the symptoms of intoxication. Except of already existing breathing paralysis, the treatment is easy and impressive within the realm of inpatient circumstances and with the option of ECG-monitoring.
