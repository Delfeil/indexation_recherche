Abstract.  A 73-year-old women developed an inflammatory tumor on her right cheek within 3 weeks. The lesion measured more than 7 cm in diameter, contained a central crateriform depression and was studded with several sterile pustules. Histology showed a dense dermal infiltration of neutrophils, but no leukocytoclasia or destruction of dermal tissue. There was no associated leukocytosis or fever, but the patient suffered from recurrent chronic bronchitis. Because the acute inflammation was progressive under treatment with antibiotics, high-dose corticosteroids were given systemically. The tumor regressed quickly and resolved without scarring. Although this localized Sweet's syndrome is unusual, it fulfills several major and minor criteria of Sweet's syndrome and thus represents a rare form of this disease.
