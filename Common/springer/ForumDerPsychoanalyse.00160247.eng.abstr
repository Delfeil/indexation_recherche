By means of personal experiences of the analytic situation and several case descriptions the concept of the evently suspended attention of Freud is compared with the concept of reverie of Bion in relation to their different position in the analytic process. The different process characteristics will be identified. Reverie is not identical with evenly suspended attention, as it is treated usually in the analytic literature. Reverie in the sense of Bion refers to qualitative different, deeper, more restrictive and fragmentary transference dimensions than the evenly suspended attention in the sense of Freud which is more related to an elaborated concept of transference and countertransference processes.
