Every action taken by a physician comes under the jurisdiction of the courts. The physician is sentenced when he offends against the duties of care, set down by the respective standard, or when he carries out treatment without having first obtained the patient's consent. Using the examples of many decisions made by the chief justice and the supreme court relating to the field of anaesthesia, this paper sets out to indicate which rules on diligence apply in this area. In the second part, 14 guiding principles on the physician's obligation to obtain informed consent are set out. The burden of proof for fulfillment of this obligation lies with the physician. The final part of the paper is a discussion of the documentational obligations, which are important for litigation on the physician's liability. A description of a variety of topics from a physician's everyday work is also given.
