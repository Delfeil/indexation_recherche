A 68-year old woman presented with ulcerations on the calves that had occurred spontaneously. The very painful lesions both clinically and histologically showed the characteristics of pyoderma gangrenosum. During hospitalization she was treated with corticosteroids (oral, i.v., topically), clofazimine, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immune globulin, cyclosporine (oral, local), dapsone, thalidomide and sodium cromoglycate (topically) without any benefit. Finally, when treated with mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) (oral) and cyclosporine (oral), her skin lesions showed continuous improvement. The topical application of thrombocytic growth factors (cytokines) probably accelerated the granulation. Eight weeks after initiating this treatment the lesions could be covered with split thickness skin grafts. Our observation suggests that mycophenolate mofetil, a novel immunosuppressive agent which has thus far been used almost exclusively in transplantation medicine, may be an effective therapeutic modality in combination with cyclosporine A for the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.
