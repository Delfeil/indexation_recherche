Abstract  In a retrospective study we examined whether it is possible to achieve better results in carotid artery surgery with a new operative technique called "no-touch-isolation technique" in combination with intraoperative angiography than with conventional operative techniques. Patients and methods: In 1997 and 1998, 80 patients who were operated on using this new operative technique were compared with a group of 144 patients who had undergone conventional carotid endarterectomy. The new aspect of the no-touch-isolation technique is that the whole operation strategy aims to avoid possible intraoperative and postoperative embolism. At first, the internal carotid artery is exposed and clamped distally to the stenotic plaque very atraumatically. The operation was then continued without an intraluminal shunt. At the end of the operation the result was checked by means of an intraoperative angiography. If any suggestion of a possible embolism, such as tears of the intima, were seen, an intraoperative revision was carried out until all thrombembolic material was removed. Results: The two groups were not different regarding age, sex, symptoms, degree of stenosis and risk factors nor did any significant differences exist in the operative technique used for endarterectomy (with or without patch, eversions-TEA, etc.). The group operated on with the no-touch-isolation technique had significantly longer operation- times (110 min vs 90 min) and also significantly longer clamping times (38.7 min vs 28.2 min) than the group operated on using conventional technique. The postoperative results, however, were still better. There were significantly fewer neurological deficits (4.1% vs 9.3%). Conclusion: The no-touch-isolation technique in combination with intraoperative angiography is a very safe method of treatment in patients with symptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery with a more than 70% degree of stenosis.
