The variability of genes coding for xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes is an important reason for individual variations in susceptibilities towards chemical toxicants. In environmental and occupational medicine, polymorphisms of different isoforms of cytochrome P450, of N-acetyl-transferase (NAT2) and of glutathione transferase (GSTT1, GSTM1) are now of importance. In particular, the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2E1 is a key enzyme of the oxidative metabolism of highly relevant industrial chemicals as it metabolizes alkenes as well as aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons. The influence of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) on the carcinogenic effect of aromatic amines upon the urothelium has been well established; the  N-oxidation of aromatic amines leading to toxic and carcinogenic intermediates is higher in "slow" compared to "rapid" acetylators. In general, it is now evident that polymorphisms of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes may have a decisive role in modulating the effects of toxicants on humans. Further progress in this field is to be expected, and calls for intensive discussion of both the preventiv and sociopolitical aspects.
