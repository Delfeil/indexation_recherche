A 12-year-old boy presented with sudden onset of confusion, mydriasis, and dryness of the mouth. Intoxication by an atropine-like substance was suspected despite missing hints to drug or liquor ingestion. Serum and urine specimens were analysed for toxic substances including alkaloids. Only in urine scopolamine and hyoscyamine (l-atropine) were detectable.  After his recovery and upon thorough questioning the boy remembered that he had consumed an "exotic fruit", which was then identified as a thorn-apple ("Jimson weed", Datura spec.).  Discussion: After its consumption the expected concentrations of the toxic tropane alkaloids in body fluids are very low. Therefore, success of toxicological analysis depends on hints from medical examination and on a well equipped specialized laboratory.
