There are around 28,000 people of reproductive age and infected with HIV living in Germany at present. In recent years, modern antiretrovirus therapy has not only extended their life expectancy, but also restored to them aspects of life that were thought to be already lost. The desire for a child of one's own as the expression of a fulfilling relationship with one's partner can be one of these aspects, but the danger of infecting the healthy partner stands in the way of its realization. Procedures devised for assisted conception do offer a way out of this dilemma, but are sometimes not applied because practitioners have ethical or medical reservations or are worried about legal liability. While in the case of HIV-positive women this hesitation still seems justified, particularly as there is a real risk that a mother can transmit the virus to the fetus, HIV infection in the man has now become an indication for assisted reproduction techniques. Motile sperm can be separated from any HIV viruses contained in the ejaculate by a special preparation method. After testing by a highly sensitive detection technique they can be used for insemination, IVF or ICSI, so helping the healthy spouse to bear a healthy child.
