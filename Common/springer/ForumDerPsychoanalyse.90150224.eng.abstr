The article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by Weiss and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioristic theories and therapeutic techniques. The basic assumption is: pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals. Patients are unconsciously motivated to overcome pathogenic beliefs. In psychotherapy, the patient works to disprove pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist. In this way patients achieve corrective emotional experiences. The theory is supported by numerous empirical studies.
