 Objective: Patients in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) have a high incidence of nosocomial infections which often lead to septic shock and death. Since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult, it was recommended to obtain routine nose/throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient.    Methods: In 1435 patients of our cardio-surgical ICU, routine nose/throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro-organisms and resistance to antibiotics. Of these 86 patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation, and additional blood cultures were obtained. Antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose/throat swabs, or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative.    Results: Of the 86 patients with systemic inflammation, 29 had blood cultures positive for microbes. Of these 29 patients, 18 received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose/throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab. However, in only 11 of the 18 patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes. While positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response, routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity.    Conclusions: Routine nose/throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22% of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation. In addition, in almost 40% of the cases organisms detected in the routine swabs and blood cultures were not identical. As a result, we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier, specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients.
