 Rules still valid today continue the tradition of state narcotics control, conceding therapeutic decisions to the physician, but at the same time allowing only restrictive use of narcotics. Legal control of medically indicated use of narcotics is burdened with conflicts. Recently, physicians have been given more scope in the use of strong opioids for pain therapy. Existing limits for a dose of opioids may be exceeded when necessary. However, there are still formal rules in the German Narcotics Drug Act.
