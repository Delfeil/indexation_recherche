Purpose: Small areas of retinal pathology may pose diagnostic difficulties. The noninvasive multifocal electroretinogram (MF-ERG) provides a topographical mapping of retinal function. Its role in the diagnosis of macular diseases is examined in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a main cause of central visual loss in the elderly population, affecting the second eye in 75 %.
