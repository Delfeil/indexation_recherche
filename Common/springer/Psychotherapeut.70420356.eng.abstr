In this contribution a new approach to the microanalytic study of cognitive-affective processes in psychotherapeutic interaction is presented. Using videorecordings, verbal and nonverbal aspects of psychotherapeutic interaction were analyzed. Correspondences between relationship patterns which are mentioned by a client and interactive relationship patterns which are enacted with the therapist are studied. The focus lies on narrative episodes and enactments in the context of guilt feelings. Applying our methods on a single case, different patterns of interaction were observed which repeatedly occur in the context of reported guilt feelings. What such enactments look like and which function they may serve in the affective regulation of psychotherapeutic interaction is explained by the example of a so-called chicken trap. Furthermore, the question is discussed which role these interactive relationship patterns may play for psychotherapeutic change.
