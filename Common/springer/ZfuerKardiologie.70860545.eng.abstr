  We present the case of a 73-year-old gentleman with a 3-week history of recurrent exertional angina confirmed by exercise stress testing. The symptoms were caused by hemangioma situated between the pulmonary artery and the left auricle. The diagnosis was confirmed by ventriculography, coronary angiography, and CT-scanning. The tumor was completely removed through a midline sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation. Histology revealed the diagnosis of a cavernous hemangioma with endothelial lined vascular channels of varying size. The patient made an uneventful recovery and remained asymptomatic during follow up. Cardiac hemangioma are rare tumors of the heart that may cause angina by interfering with the coronary blood flow. Surgery is curative for most patients.
