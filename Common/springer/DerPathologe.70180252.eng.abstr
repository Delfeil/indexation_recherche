The case of a 63-year-old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described. Histopathological and cytopathological examination of tissue from the retroperitoneal tumor led to a diagnosis of lymphoreticular neoplasia. The patient died in acute cardiac failure, five weeks after initial presentation. Autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium. Macroscopically, the bone marrow appeared normal. The tumor cells were reactive for CD45, vimentin and chloroacetate esterase, but were unreactive with a broad spectrum of antibodies against myelomonocytic and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c-kit (CD117), characteristic markers for mast cells. However, the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis. A diagnosis of bone marrow mastocytosis with an associated secondary extramedullary mast cell sarcoma was established. The cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic atrioseptal tumor nodule.
