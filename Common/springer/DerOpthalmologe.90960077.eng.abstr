Purpose: Biological agents like human serum or autologous platelets have recently been employed as adjuvants for macular hole surgery. However, the role of these agents on the retinal cellular level remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of human platelets, serum and PDGF on RPE migration and proliferation in cell culture.
