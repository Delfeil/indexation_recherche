The treatment of deep cartilage defects is a challenge for every orthopeadic surgeon. The potention for regeneration of cartilage tissue is minimal and leads to mechanically inferior fibrous tissue. The established techniques induce the growth of fibrous tissue but fail to prevent arthrosis. Autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be the most promising therapy concept with clinical relevance to reserves a full thickness cartilage defekt with hyaline-like cartilage. Outcome studies with a follow up from 2-10 years show in up to 90 % good and excellent results for defects on the femoral condyle and 70 % for the patella. Mechanical testing of the regenerated cartilage showed almost simular stiffness as nearly normal hyaline cartilage. The available data justify the acceptance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation as a standard procedure for limited indications and well-trained surgeons. Result of already inaugurated studies will show the potential of chondrocyte transplantation to prevent osteoarthritis.
