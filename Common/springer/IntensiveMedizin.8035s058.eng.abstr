  Brain electrical monitoring is sensitive to changes in neuronal function due to ischemic or traumatic neuronal injury. The sensitivity and specificity to detect these functional changes varies with the type of insult and the choice of the background anesthetic. Measurements of depth of anesthesia (using arousal patterns of the EEG) as well as specific EEG patterns for pharmacodynamic quantification of drug effects promise to achieve the optimum relation between anesthetic dose and anesthetic effect. Transcranial Doppler sonography is a semiquantitative, noninvasive and continuous measure of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) induced by anesthetics, narcotics or CBF autoregulation. Monitoring of the diastolic blood flow velocity pattern is a sensitive parameter of critical CBF and ischemic neuronal dysfunction due to decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure. Laser Doppler flowmetry is an invasive but continuous technique used to assess changes in microcirculatory CBF in the vicinity of brain lesions. While increases and decreases in CBF can be detected, thresholds indicating ischemia and hyperemia still have to be identified. Monitoring of jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation reflects the balance between cerebral oxygen supply and cerebral oxygen demand. This allows determination of the critical threshold level of cerebral perfusion pressure below which increasing oxygen extraction relates to cerebral hypoperfusion. Near infrared spectroscopy promises to be a technology with potential for noninvasive measurements of cerebral oxygen saturation, mitochondrial oxygen availability, and CBF. However, with the current technology, near infrared spectroscopy suffers from contamination of the signal from extracranial sources. Invasive brain tissue pO2 measurements accurately reflect local oxygenation of cerebral tissue and may help to taper the perioperative hemodynamic management according to the individual status of the patient.
