 We report a case of a 30-year-old patient who - after unsuccessfull resuscitation - died during gynecological laparoscopy. Prefinal symptoms corresponded to acute gas embolism, particularly as ultrasonic examination revealed an intravascular gas pulsation. At autopsy, 2 days postmortem, a punction of the left common iliac vein was discovered but gas bubbles in the right heart could not be confirmed. Preconditions for fatal carbon dioxide embolism are stressed. To prove the presence of carbon dioxide gas postmortem, autopsy has to be performed as soon as possible and the corpse has to be stored without cooling.
