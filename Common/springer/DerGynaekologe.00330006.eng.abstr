Natural products and their derivatives are well established in clinical research and for medical applications. There are excellent drugs available from various plants and microorganisms. Recent developments in the different screening techniques have accelerated the discovery of new compounds. Furthermore, the investigation of compounds of marine origin, which have been more difficult to obtain, has become possible. With the help of combinatorial methods, natural products can be modified to optimize their use for medical applications. Due to the enormous medical potential, modern research on natural products will also be important in the next century.
