We report the case of a 22-year-old woman who underwent two-step scoliosis surgery without allogeneic transfusion, although the intraoperative blood loss (3500 ml) during the first procedure was higher than the calculated blood volume (3250 ml). Preoperatively the patient had donated four units of autologous blood. Intraoperatively blood-saving methods were combined. During the first operation acute normovolemic hemodilution (target hemoglobin 9.0 g/dl) was applied and during the second operation controlled hypotension (systolic blood pressure 80 mmHg). Intraoperative autotransfusion was used in both procedures. During the first operation severe normovolemic anemia (minimal hemoglobin 3.5 g/dl) was accepted while the patient was ventilated with FiO2 1.0. The hemoglobin concentration was 8.6 g/dl after the first procedure and had increased to 11.6 g/dl 4 weeks after the second procedure. No severe complications occurred during the postoperative phase. This case report shows that also in surgical procedures with extreme blood loss any allogeneic transfusion can be avoided by the combination of blood-saving methods, acceptance of low intraoperative transfusion trigger and ventilation with 100% oxygen.
