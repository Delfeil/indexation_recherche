Based on its unique botulinum toxin is referred to as the most poisonous poison. Its specific inhibition of the acetyl-cholin-dependent neuromuscular transmission is used by ophthalmologists and neurologists for the relaxation of spastic or dystonic muscles, preferrably in muscle groups in the head and neck area. Analogously, it is being used by dermatologists to remove facial wrinkles by paralyzing mimic muscles which account for mechanically induced wrinkling. Apart from this purely cosmetic use, botulinum toxin has gained recent attention in dermatology as a potent treatment modality for circumscribed hyperhidrosis.
