 The chronic compression syndrome of the crural fascia is defined as a new pathological entity. Multifactorial influences lead to hardening of the connective tissue of the crural fascia, which then in turn determines the further course of the disease. The main symptom is leg ulcer, which is as yet incurable. By means of crural fasciectomy, the ulcers could be cured in 17 of 18 patients, some of whom had endured several decades of failed conservative therapy; the treatment of the last patient has not yet been completed. The follow-up time ranged from 10 to 36 months (mean 14.6 months). Crural fasciectomy affects the underlying cause of the disease by significantly reducing the pathologically raised pressures within the compartments from 21.1 mmHg in the lying and 62.5 mmHg in the standing position to 15.5 mmHg and 34.5 mmHg respectively (p = 0.172 and p = 0.003 respectively).
