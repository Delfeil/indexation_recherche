 Between 1987 and 1996 302 patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases. Out of this pool 252 completely documented cases were analysed. Forty-five patients (18 %) of this population were 70 years or older at time of admission. In this population 17 major resections and 8 minor liver resections were performed. In 9 patients irresectable metastases were diagnosed during treatment of the primary tumor. In 3 cases laparotomy had to be finished as exploration. Eight patients were treated without surgery. Mortality after liver resection was 4 %, morbidity 28 %. The 5-year-survival-rate (Kaplan-Meier) of the R0 resected patients (n = 21) was 44 %. Comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease. Survival, morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences. These results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed efficently and with a curative intention.
