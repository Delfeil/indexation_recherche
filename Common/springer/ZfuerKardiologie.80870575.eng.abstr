  Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology. The main reason is the capability to obtain "in-vivo" micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo-transducers with an outer diameter of 2.9-3.5 French. For the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on lumenograms but also on vessel wall assessment. The capabilities of IVUS can be divided in its diagnostic and intervention associated potentials. The diagnostic strength of IVUS is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis, to assess intermediate lesions, to reveal occult left main stem disease, and angiographically "silent" arteriosclerosis. In conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve, patients with the diagnosis of coronary "syndrome X" can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis. Additionally, IVUS is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the AHA/ACC Stary classification.
