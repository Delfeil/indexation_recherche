After surgical operations delirium can occur as a serious and possible lethal complication in about 5-15% of patients. Additionally, risk factors such as old age, polymedication, organic and psychiatric diseases raise the incidence. After open-heart- and orthopedic surgery more than half of the patients are affected. Delirium has negative effects on postoperative mobilization and reconvalescence and prolongs treatment on the ward. It is discussed in the literature that delirium may induce dementia in older patients.
