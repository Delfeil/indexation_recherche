Abstract.  Taking into account the increase in worldwide human migration, leprosy is of growing importance in the differential diagnosis of dermatological diseases encountered in Central Europe. We report on the case of a young man from Ghana who developed hypopigmented maculae and plaques on his trunk and proximal limbs. The diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy could be made in consideration of the histological pattern of infiltrating leucocytes and detection of numerous acid-fast mycobacteria on skin biopsy. The results of the physical examination as well as routine laboratory and immunological parameters were consistent with this form of leprosy. Due to glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency, treatment with dapsone was contraindicated. With high-dose rifampicin and clofazimine therapy, the skin changes cleared over the course of 11 months following a leprosy reaction type II (erythema nodosum leprosum) that developed during a phase of discontinued therapy due to low patient compliance.
