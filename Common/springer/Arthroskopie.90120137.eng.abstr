Arthroscopy, joint lavage and suction drainage, and open surgery are used in the treatment of knee joint empyema. Between February 1991 and December 1997, we treated 97 cases arthroscopically. In most cases, the cause of infection was intra-articular injection. Infections after surgical procedures were found in 39 patients. In spite of a clear macroscopical findings, in about one third of the cases the infecting organism could not be found in the synovial fluid culture. During the first operations, the arthroscopy was performed according to the stage of infection: for stage I, only lavage of the knee joint was performed; for stages II and III, synovectomy was also done. The lavages were performed using separate inflow cannula at least 15 l fluid. At the end of the operations, a collagen-fleece (Sulmycin Implant) containing antibiotica was brought into the joint. Systemically, a first generation cephalosporin was given before culture and changed when necessary. The further course was carefully observed postoperatively. Depending on the course and laboratory findings such as WBC, ESR, and CRP, the indication and timing for further revisions were made. In most cases, second-look operations 5-7 days after the first ones were planned. Depending on the course, further operations were also performed. If necessary, partial synovectomy, removal of fibrin clots and adhesions, and additional lavage were performed during the second examination. After that, intra-articular instillation of 160-320 mg gentamycin (Refobacin) was performed. Also during the second examination, synovial fluid cultures were taken to find the infecting organism.
