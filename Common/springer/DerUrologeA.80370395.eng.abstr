Today the organ donor operation in brain dead donors is mostly projected as multiple organ procurement (MOP). Not only the kidneys, but heart and liver or additionally lungs and pancreas are removed in MOP. A good synchronization between the collaborating transplantation groups (thoracic and abdominal surgeon, urologist) is essential to prevent loss of an organ because of technical problems. In Germany urologists perform more than 40 % of kidney transplantations. These urologic institutions perform the cadaver kidney retrievals and participate on MOP. If possible, an urologist experienced in renal transplantation should contribute to the care for quality of the kidneys. Since 1987 the transplant center of Bremen obtained 390 donor registrations. 202 organ donor operations have been performed (106 MOP and 96 exclusive kidney retrievals). 398 donor kidneys have been collected and 382 could be transplanted.
