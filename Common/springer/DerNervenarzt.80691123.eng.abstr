In 1994 this journal published the results of a survey undertaken on behalf of the Working Association for Neurological Intensive Care Medicine (ANIM) in the winter of 1992/93. In the winter of 1996/97 a continuation of this analysis was performed. With the help of a questionaire the data of 62 intensive care units with a total of 420 beds were established. This is 11 intensive care units and 83 beds more than 1992/93. The intensive care units were again classified into three groups (ventilation units, monitoring units, interdisciplinary units) relating to their equipment and structure. The questions concerned structural organisation, such as the number of beds, type of clinic, number and training of physicians and nurses, technical equipment and availability of large and high-tech apparatus or access to other facilities, such as neurosurgery. Of great interest were data about whether and to what extent special measures of intensive medicine can be taken on the one hand and performance parameter data e.g. days of ventilation and duration of in-patient treatment on the other hand. Detailed data were provided concerning the frequency of each diagnosis of patients treated in those intensive care units. Evaluating the data a positive development in the last four years of the neurological intensive care can be found in most of the areas investigated. It has also been found that neurological intensive care in the new lander has reached equal standard both in quality and quantity. Now a single physician is responsible for 2,3 beds compared to 3,6. Today 78 per cent of the beds in ventilation units are equiped with a ventilator. The overall time of ventilation increased to 48 per cent. Overall there are, however, considerable differences between individual units as well as regions. The data presented can serve as a means to monitor the quality of neurological intensive care.
