  On occasion of the 100th anniversary of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in Russia in the years from 1926 to 1937. These operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation. This work pioneered by Russian scientist S. Brukhonenko and the Surgeon N. Terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public. The first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than 260 operations on the valves of the open heart, the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism, and principles of open heart surgery stated by N. Terebinski were decades ahead of the development at the time. In the authors' opinion they represent a milestone in the history of open heart surgery.
