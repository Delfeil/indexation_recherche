The cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue is essentially intended to maintain fertility and endocrinological function in female cancer patients and female patients at increased risk of early menopause. After having been frozen and subsequently thawed, the tissue can, ideally, be transplanted to its original site, where it leads to spontaneous fertilisation. Heterotopic transplantations are also discussed as autografts or xenotransplants in SCID mice. In addition to the use of whole tissue, the isolation of individual follicles and their in vitro maturation (IVM) are discussed. As in the case of heterotopic transplantation of ovarian tissue, pregnancy can only be achieved in these cases by in vitro fertilisation of the matured oocytes. Although considerable progress has already been made in both directions, these are still, at the present time, experimental processes that require further in-depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application. In addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, IVM of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction. The successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation. IVM is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of PCOS patients, for instance, increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by "rescuing" IVF cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes.
