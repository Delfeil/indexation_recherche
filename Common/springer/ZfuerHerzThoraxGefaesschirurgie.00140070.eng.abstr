 Internal mammary artery (IMA) bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium. Their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia. This study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the IMA graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia. Twenty-five patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the IMA as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries. Distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood-cardioplegic  arrest. After unclamping the aorta and IMA graft, the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion. A sufficient IMA graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature: The cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course, respectively. The rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side, and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side. An insufficient IMA graft function could be recognized by atypical temperature courses.
