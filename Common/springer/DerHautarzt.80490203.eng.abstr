The effectiveness of concurrent psychotherapeutic treatment for various skin diseases can be regarded as sufficiently validated. Contributions on in-patient treatment concepts are rare, and there are up to now no reports on methods integrating psychotherapeutic treatment approaches. Our concept of a 4-week short-term psychotherapy - starting from a conflict hypothesis in the complaint intensifying, acute situation - includes the bimodal work on both understanding and practice oriented treatment focus. By means of 2 case studies with 1-year-follow-up, insight is given into the treatment approach from which effective factors of psychotherapeutic treatment were tentatively in with patients with skin diseases.
