Certain fractures and/or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post-traumatic osteonecrosis. However, the more complex etiology of non-traumatic osteonecrosis is multifactorial and includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, thermal injuries, and especially coagulopathies, which are now commonly observed in these patients. Intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation, and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent hypofibrinolysis.
