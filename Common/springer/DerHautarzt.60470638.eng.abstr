White piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals, caused by the widespread Trichosporon fungi. The infection is characterized clinically by whitish, soft and easily removable coating of the hair shafts; however, the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points. While all body hair may be affected, the pubic hair is most frequently affected. This paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34-year-old Central European man. In all, 22 cases have been described world-wide in young men ranging in age from 20 to 40 years. Only 2 men, aged 42 and 53 years, do not fall in this range. Recently, a major African study disclosed this disease in women for the first time. In moderate latitudes, however, this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men.
