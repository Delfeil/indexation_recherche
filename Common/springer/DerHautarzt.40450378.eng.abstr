Abstract.  We report on an 11-year-old female patient with anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (AED) showing the following characteristics: (1) reduced number of hair follicles and incomplete formation of sweat glands; (2) disturbed hair growth with shortening of anagen and anhidrosis; (3) disturbed cytokeratin expression pattern of CK 13, 14, 19 (follicular epithelium) and of CK 18 (eccrine sweat glands); (4) reduction of cystine and increase in sulphonic cysteine acid. Thus, we demonstrated pathological differentiation on the immunomorphological and on the biochemical level, leading to disturbed keratinization that could be visualized by transmission and scanning electron microscopical studies of the hair shafts. According to these findings AED is a developmental defect that involves not only incomplete formation of hair follicles and sweat glands but also a disordered differentiation and follicular keratinization with disturbed cytokeratin pattern and pathological amino acid composition of the terminal hairs produced.
