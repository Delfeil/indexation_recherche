 In 96 patients (ductal pancreatic carcinoma, n = 34; periampullary carcinoma, n = 43; chronic pancreatitis, n = 19) the role of CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of lesions of the head of the pancreas were evaluated. The sensitivity for ductal pancreatic carcinoma was 73.3 %, for periampullary carcinoma 48.8 %, and specificity was 63.2 %. Carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated only in every fifth patient. Even when combining the two tumor markers no increase in sensitivity could be observed. The low specificity of 63 %, which decreased to 33 % in the case of obstructive jaundice, does not allow adequate preoperative differentiation between cancer patients and those with chronic pancreatitis. In cases of postoperatively elevated CA 19-9 level the prognosis is worse than in patients with normal tumor markers.
