The recommended treatment for full-thickness macular holes is removal of the posterior hyaloid and sometimes the epiretinal membrane from the retina during vitrectomy in order to release the assumed intravitreous traction. We have employed a technique involving the additional removal of the membrana limitans interna (MLI) from the retina in the vicinity of the macular hole. We report on our clinical results and ultrastructural findings.
