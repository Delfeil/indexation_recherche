We examined 223 patients who underwent arthrolysis after ACL reconstruction. An arthrofibrosis group (n = 156, 70%) and a cyclops group (n = 57, 30%) were formed. The mean time interval between arthrolysis and follow-up examination was 3.98 years. We recorded: timing of surgery; additional injuries; state of the knee before reconstruction; range of motion during rehabilitation; pain; beginning, length and type of rehabilitation; severeness and etiology of joint stiffness; and the time between ACL reconstruction and revision. Furthermore, the present state of the knee was documented. A significant correlation between arthrofibrosis and preoperative irritation (P = 0.001), preoperative limited ROM (P = 0.02), perioperative pain (P = 0.023), and an early beginning of muscle training (P = 0.024) was found. These correlations were not obvious in the cyclops group. The combination of a remaining loss of extension and development of degenerative joint disease proved to be significant (P = 0.028). The decrease of sports activity compared to the level before ACL injury was also highly significant (P < 0.001).
