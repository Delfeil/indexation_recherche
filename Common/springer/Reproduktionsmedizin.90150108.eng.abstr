In this review, empirical findings on the influence of stress on sperm parameter are presented. Although stress is not associated per se with an abnormal semen analysis, personal and situational factors may cause a decrease in sperm quality. The patient's subjective perception of stress represents an essential personal factor, whereas chronicity of stress represents a situational factor. At present, little is known about the endocrine mechanisms mediating the influence of stress on spermatogenesis. Additionally, it is not yet clear to what extent fertility is actually affected by stress-induced decrease of sperm quality. Irrespective of the effects of stress on the sperm parameters, there are other relevant behavioral effects of stress on fertility: patients infrequently seek professional help; chances to conceive may be reduced due to sexual difficulties. Patients feeling highly distressed should be offered proven interventions to reduce stress.
