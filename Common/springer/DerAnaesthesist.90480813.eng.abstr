Preoperative starvation in order to prevent pulmonary aspiration is mandatory in elective pediatric surgery. Hypoglycemia, thirst and unwellness have been reported as undesired side effects. The metabolic response towards decreasing blood-glucose concentrations in fasting children includes gluconeogenesis and production of ketone bodys to meet the energetic demand. Accumulation of -hydroxybutyrate und acetoacetate in blood can lead to ketoacidosis. We report a case of a severe intraoperative ketoacidosis in a fourteen months old child complicating 36 hours of starvation.
