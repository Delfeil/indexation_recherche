 In a case of suspected whiplash shaken infant syndrome with intracerebral bleeding in a 3-week-old infant, the defense was given that the bleeding had occurred during birth and/or that any sign of recent hemorrhage in the cerebrospinal fluid was caused artificially by the spinal puncture itself. Centrifugation of the bloody fluid with subsequent cytological investigation revealed well-preserved erythrocytes, a few lymphocytes, and a slightly elevated number of neutrophilic granulocytes. Of particular note was the immunocytochemical demonstration of small clusters of immature macrophages. Neither erythrophagocytosis nor hemosiderin could be detected. These findings rule out both a bleeding age of 3 weeks and artificial hemorrhage caused by the spinal puncture. The onset of bleeding could be limited to a time span of 12-18 (up to 48) h prior to fluid removal.
