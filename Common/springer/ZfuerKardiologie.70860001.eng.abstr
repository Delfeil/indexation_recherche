  In heart failure the chronic sympathetic stimulation alters the cardiac -adrenergic pathway. This alteration leads to a diminished contractile response to stimulation of the cardiac 1 receptor. A blockade of the 1 receptor partly restores the physiologic response to sympathetic stimulation at rest and during exercise. Several mechanisms resulting from the competitive blockade of the 1 receptor may be important. The major effect of -blockers seems to be triggered by a reduction of the heart rate at rest resulting in an increase of the left ventricular ejection fraction on the average by 7-8%.
