Eruptive vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with vellus hairs, which appear in children or young adults. A 21-year-old patient is reported who developed asymptomatic comedo-like papules on his face, neck and chest. Histopathologically, epidermoid cysts with a fine stratum granulosum, laminated keratinous material and numerous vellus hairs were found in the mid-dermis. Evaluation of immediate family members revealed that the patient's father was similarly affected. Eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex are clinically similar, but have distinctive histopathological features and should be regarded as distinct entities.
