In recent years we identified numerous cardiovascular risk factors and had been able to reduce cardiovascular events by a variety of different interventions. There is no question that we can improve the course of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with a high-risk profile by modifying these factors. Despite this knowledge, many patients with known CAD or myocardial infarction are not treated for secondary prevention as recommended by well established guidelines . In order to improve secondary prevention in our patients we started a project, the so called "Marburg CAD Prevention Project". By this we combine our computer data base of the CAD preventional routine laboratory with the computer program CARDDAS. Individual risk factors and the angiographic findings were analyzed. Patients as well as local physicians were informed on the need to treat the important risk factors. This approach ensures that at least all of out patients with documented CAD receive the appropriate preventional recommendations and treatment.
