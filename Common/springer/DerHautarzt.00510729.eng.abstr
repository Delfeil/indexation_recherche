Hair problems are attacked at the levels of information supply, trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment. The alopecias represent a major health care challenge, and the psychological significance of hair loss has only recently found appreciation in the medical community. They may pose a vexing problem for non-specialized physicians, who tend to trivialize such complaints, although the patient's perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought. Perception of a hair problem is subject to sociocultural standards; films and advertisements help determine the threshold for "normality" and what is "healthy" and "beautiful", and the media provide an abundance of undiscriminating information with respect to hair care. Patients with hair problems frequently consult the hairdresser prior to the medical specialist. Thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser's training qualifications. Besides manual, creative and psychological aptitudes, "trichological competence" relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders, recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required. To optimize the interaction between the physician, hairdressers and the media, more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable, with success depending on full identification of the set goals, qualification and adherance to the standards determined by the medical speciality.
