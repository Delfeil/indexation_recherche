 The genetic reasons for male infertility are still poorly understood. In approximately 30 % of infertile men no reason for their defect in spermatogenesis can be found (idiopathic infertility). In a high percentage of these patients single gene defects are assumed to be responsible for the infertility. Well-known reasons for infertility are microdeletions on the long arm of the Y chromosome. In approximately 3-18 % of patients with azoospermia or severe oligospermia these deletions can be detected by using molecular techniques. In 4-6 % of infertile men chromosomal abnormalities are responsible for their andrological disorder. While numeric aberrations are widely observed in patients with azoospermia, alterations in chromosomal structure are prominent in patients with oligozoospermia. Chromosomal anomalies can be found only in rare cases of patients with structural or functional sperm defects. Up to now the genetic basis has only be described for a few functional or structural sperm defects (immotile cilia syndrome, globozoospermia). More recently, it became possible to identify genes involved in spermatogenesis and to investigate their functions in male germ cell differentiation by using new tools of molecular biology, e. g. gene replacement techniques in the mouse. For the majority of these genes homologous human genes are known. However, the role of these genes in human spermatogenesis and their relevance for male fertility have still to be elucidated.
