Besides a knowledge of material properties geometric properties are needed to investigate the mechanical behavior of the human eardrum. Although the geometry of the eardrum has been examined methodically, its composition has been described in the literature. The true surface geometry of a cadaver specimen of the human eardrum was examined under a laser-scanning microscope. Forty points (85 parameters) depicted the surface of this cadaver specimen and formed the basis for a finite shell model. Furthermore, the coupling with the malleus and its suspension was simulated. Additional geometric and material parameters were chosen from the available literature. Both static behavior and the influence of a parameter variation to modal behavior of the finite element model were tested. ANSYS 5.1 software was used for this study.
