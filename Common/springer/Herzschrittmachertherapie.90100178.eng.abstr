 Objectives: To clarify the incidence of sudden arrythmic death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx). Background: Some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long-term success of the operation. Incidence, underlying risk factors, etiologies, and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined. Methods: Retrospective analysis of our cohort of 120 cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of 142HTx patients of the years 1984-1999. Clinical events (death, mode of death, Re-HTx, resuscitation) were noted and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and related to the patients' characteristics by multivariate analysis. Sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or unwittnessed death. Clinical and postmortem findings (autopsies are available in 12/18 sudden death patients) were correlated to the mode of death. Results: During a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 +/- 3.5 years, 45 patients died (38%). The mode of death was non-sudden in 27 inpatients. 18 deaths were sudden, 14 of these out of hospital. In addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations, one of those patients died three month later suddenly, giving a number of a total of 21 cardiac arrests in 20HTx patients. The actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20% after 6 and 40% after 12 years. Based on postmortem analysis the etiologies of the events were attributed to transplant vasculopathy in 15 patients, rejection in 5 patients (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade >3A), and to unknown reasons in one. All three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented bradycardic events (2xtotal AV block, 1xsinus arrest). Pacemakers were implanted in these patients. One of those died suddenly 2 months later. Significantly more HTx patients dying suddenly are smokers, had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and worse hemodynamics. QRS width and PR interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest. In three cases, a decrease in heart rate variability, the occurence of sustained VT, and ST segment depressions prior to the cardiac arrest could be demonstrated. Conclusions: Sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after HTx. As HTx patient numbers are rising constantly, sudden cardiac death in this population will represent a significant problem. In our patients about 75% of the arrests can be attributed to graft-vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection. Diagnostic strategies have to be developed to detect patients at risk. Interestingly, some events may be caused from bradyarrhythmic rhythm disturbances.
