Prompted by the ongoing discussion of the pros and cons of using succinylcholine, this study was conducted to compare the responses to bolus injections of atracurium or vecuronium with those after sequential injection of these drugs (priming principle). We evaluated the earliest possible intubation times, intubating conditions, and the onset times (i.e. times from the end of injection to the maximum blockade) under conditions approaching real use as closely as possible. Methods. The randomized and double-blind study was carried out with 80 ASA risk class 1 and 2 patients. Approval of the institutional ethics committee was obtained, and each patient gave informed consent. Patients were randomly allocated to four study groups of 20 patients each. Isotonic saline was administered to those patients assigned to the atracurium or vecuronium bolus groups, whereas the patients assigned to the other two groups received a priming injection of either atracurium (0.05 mg/kg) or vecuronium (0.01 mg/kg). We observed the patients for signs of incipient muscular weakness before the induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopental 3.5 min after the first injection (5 mg/kg and 50-100 mg before intubation). After a further 1 min during which adequate mask ventilatin with oxygen was assured, corresponding to a priming interval of 4.5 min, 0.5 mg/kg of atracurium or 0.1 mg/kg of vecuronium was administered to the patients in the bolus groups and 0.45 mg/kg of atracurium or 0.09 mg/kg of vecuronium as intubating doses to those in the priming groups. Intubation was attempted at 90, 120, 150 and 180 s thereafter. Intubating conditions were evaluated on the basis of laryngoscopy, vocal cord movement and coughing or bucking of the patients. Neuromuscular function was monitored via accelerometry at the adductor pollicis muscle (TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve every 15 s). Results. The priming doses did not diminish the elicited twitches of the adductor pollicis muscle, but led to heavy eyelids and double vision in 35% of the atracurium patients and 47% of the vecuronium patients; these symptoms were well tolerated by the patients. At the time of intubation the adductor pollicis muscle was relaxed to approximately the same degree in all groups (mean +/- SD for the TOF ratios in the bolus groups was 0.46 +/- 0.37 for atracurium, 0.45 +/- 0.4 for vecuronium; in the priming groups 0.52 +/- 0.39 for atracurium, 0.53 +/- 0.36 for vecuronium). The administration of the relaxants in divided doses significantly shortened the intubating time after atracurium (100 vs 124 s) and improved the intubating conditions of vecuronium (good vs tolerable), but had no effect on the time course of the neuromuscular blockade (onset times in the bolus groups 224 +/- 84 s for atracurium and 209 +/- 64 s for vecuronium; in the priming groups 249 +/- 112 s for atracurium and 205 +/- 52 s for vecuronium). Conclusions. The priming technique presented here is clinically superior to the bolus method and therefore should be preferred in all elective cases and in those patients in whom succinylcholine is contraindicated.
