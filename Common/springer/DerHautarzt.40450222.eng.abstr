Abstract.  In 5 years 9 patients with a total of 16 painful ear nodules (chondrodermatitis helicis) have been treated as follows. A small excision is carried out with local anaesthesia for histological examination. The rest of the nodule or any other nodules are carbonized by means of the argon laser, also with local anaesthesia, including the surface of the cartilage under the nodules. There have been no cases of postoperative inflammation or infection. New nodules occurring several months after treatment have been successfully treated in the same way. There have been no real recurrences. The cosmetic result is very good in all cases. The patients are free of pain immediately after the laser therapy. Laser therapy for painful nodules of the ear has good and lasting results, with a lower rate of recurrences than any other form of treatment.
