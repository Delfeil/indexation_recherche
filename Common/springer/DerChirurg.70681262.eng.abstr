 In a study compiling the data in a prospective manner, the value of the pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy (PPPD) compared to partial duodenopancreatectomy (PD) in patients suffering from ductal pancreatic carcinoma was assessed. Postoperative morbidity, mortality and overall prognosis were analysed. From May 1990 to April 1995 130 patients entered the study; 61 underwent PD, 69 patients had PPPD. The patients were regularly followed up every 6 months and the median follow-up period for all patients was 36 months. PPPD in patients with ductal pancreatic head carcinoma without infiltration of the duodenum is the technically simpler and faster operation method with significantly less blood loss. Moreover, PPPD did not lead to increased postoperative complications. The median survival rate of patients in the PD group was 10.8 months, in the PPPD group 21 months. This significant difference derives from the fact that the tumor stages were unevenly distributed. Regarding the most common stage (stage III according to UICC) the median survival times were almost identical (PD group 10.1 months, PPPD group 11.2 months). The PPPD operation seems to be a sufficiently radical procedure which does not worsen the prognosis of the disease.
