"Telemedicine" is a major new development with great potential for improving health care delivery. It therefore affects each department in medicine. There is a great deal of telemedicine activity around the world. However, the term telemedicine is not clear. It describes all forms of medical information, transferred from a relevant distance by an electronic transfer media. An essential condition for communication is the intelligibility between transmitter and receiver. Because of different transmitting technologies and networks in distinct countries, towns, or even academic institutions, satisfactory contact is not possible.
