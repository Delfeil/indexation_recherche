50 depressed in-patients (unipolar depression, only severe depressive episodes without psychotic symptoms, no bipolar affective disorder, 2/3 female, 1/3 male in-patients, age range 20-60 years) consecutively admitted to the Weissenau Depression Treatment and Research Unit spring and summer 1996 were compared to 50 healthy controls (matched pairs by age and sex; no somatic or psychic disorder, no antidepressants or psychotherapeutic treatment prior to study, no suicidal behaviour known) assessed on aggressivity using the Buss-Durkey-Hostility-Inventory (BDHI). Significantly higher scores of BDHI-sum scores and especially in subscores called "inhibited aggression" were found in depressed and suicidal in-patients in comparison to healthy controls or non-suicidal depressed persons. No differences were found in open physical and verbal aggression scores.
