Plasmacytomas can be divided into multiple, solitary osseous and solitary extraosseous/extramedullary plasmacytomas. Intracranial plasmacytomas of the dura, leptomeninx and cerebrum are well known from the literature. They are manifestations of multiple myeloma, intracranial extramedullary plasmacytoma or metastatic disease of extramedullary plasmacytoma in distant locations. We describe a cerebellar manifestation of a solitary plasmacytoma of the bone, and a leptomeningeal carcinomatosis of a multiple plasmacytoma. A summary of the literature concerning intracranial plasmacytomas is given. Dural manifestations of plasmacytoma have the same features as meningiomas in CT or MRI. Cerebral or cerebellar manifestations cannot be differentiated from brain tumors by means of CT or MRI. In CT, plasmacytomas show high-density lesions. T2w-MRI reveals a low-intensity lesion. In T1w-MRI, intense homogeneous contrast enhancement can be demonstrated.
