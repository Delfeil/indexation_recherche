Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is a frequent cause of sudden cardiac death in young individuals. This disease is characterized by fibrous and adipose replacement of the right ventricular myocardium and recurrent ventricular tachycardias of left bundle branch pattern. The etiopathogenesis of this disease still remains obscure. Recently different gene defects were localized. After making the diagnosis there are different therapeutic options: medical therapy with sotalol or amiodarone may be effective in preventing recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Invasive therapy using radiofrequency ablation is also possible. A termination of the tachycardias with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator seems to be an efficient treatment. Typical findings and therapeutic considerations are shown in a case report.
