Prognosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, Ssc) is largely depending on involvement of internal organs. Abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract are found most frequently (85%), especially decreased motility of the oesophagus, which has little impact on the longterm clinical course of Ssc. Pulmonary manifestations can be demonstrated in 40- 90% of patients; one must distinguish between pulmonary hypertension or fibrotic lung disease. The heart is affected in 50% of cases. Patchy or diffuse myocardial fibrosis, as well as pericarditis and pericardial effusions can induce symptoms of arrhythmia or congestive heart failure. Renal involvement is associated with increased mortality and occurs in 45% of Ssc, producing proteinuria, hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis and renal failure. In conclusion, involvement of the lungs, heart and kidneys are determining factors for the longterm course of systemic sclerosis.
