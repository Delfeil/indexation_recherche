  Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall, dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors. There are probably several candidate genes, that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis. In recent years, a growing number of gene polymorphisms, associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction, has been identified. These genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism, regulation of blood pressure and clotting. In contrast to rare monogenetic diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms (e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia), genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent. Due to their frequency, there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease. Genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle, environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders.
