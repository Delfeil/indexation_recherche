 In the present case of a granular cell tumor an abdomino-thoracal resection of the esophagus was performed in a 41-year-old patient after preoperative diagnosis had suggested esophageal cancer. Granular cell tumors (Abrikossoff's tumor) of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis. Diagnosis can be obtained by endoscopic and histological study and immunohistochemical forceps biopsy. Because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor, it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma.
