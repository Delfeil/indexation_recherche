A new method is presented which allows the construction and implantation of highly precise custom-made endoprostheses for knee joints. The procedure is based on a computer-aided subtraction process of three-dimensional CT data. Using the differences of the CT scans, the endprosthetic components are modelled by means of a newly developed software package. The implants are manufactured by CNC machines and stereolithography.
