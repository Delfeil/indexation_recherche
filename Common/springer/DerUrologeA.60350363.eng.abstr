Adhesion molecules play an important role in organogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, and progression of malignant tumors. Three major classes of adhesion molecules may be discriminated by function: (a) calcium-dependent homotypic adhesion molecules (e. g. cadherins), (b) substrate adhesion molecules (e. g. integrins) and (c) heterotypic adhesion molecules (e. g. ICAM-1). Molecules of each of the three classes have been identified in urologic tumors. Results of research on substrate adhesion molecules and heterotypic adhesion molecules have not yet led to new clinical concepts. In contrast, loss of E-cadherin in tumors of the bladder and prostate has been clearly associated with de-differentiation of tumors and diminished survival of patients. Loss of another adhesion molecule, C-CAM, has been observed in prostate cancer. This has led to new therapeutic approaches, which are in an experimental stage at present. It may be expected that, in the future, new therapeutic concepts will be based on research on adhesion molecules in urologic tumors.
