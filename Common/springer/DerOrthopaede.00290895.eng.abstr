The anatomy and biomechanics of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint have been understood for a long time; however, the importance of this joint in the clinical setting is often underestimated. During clinical examination various sensitive functional tests can document any AC pathology. For X-ray documentation special techniques are necessary. Other imaging techniques are rarely indicated.
