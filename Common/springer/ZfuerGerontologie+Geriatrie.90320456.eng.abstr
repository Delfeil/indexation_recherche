 In this four-part review article, an update covering the gero-psychological research since 1988 in German speaking countries is given as follows: Cognitive development in old age (part I), personality development in old age (part II), social relations in old age (part III), age-related tasks, burdens, and border situations (part IV). In part IV of the update presented in this issue, research contributing to a competence perspective of old age and aging is summarized under four main headings: (1) Independence, everyday life, and everyday competence; (2) aging in spatial, physical, and technical environments; (3) health and coping with illness; (4) coping with death and dying. The article ends with a general discussion considering as well the findings of our survey addressing gerontologists from German speaking countries.
