Abstract.  Contact urticaria and anaphylactic reactions to latex-containing rubber products are being recognized with increasing frequency in all kinds of medical disciplines. Recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy. The cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented, and the importance of the association of latex and cross-reactivity with food items is stressed. The food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado; banana, avocado and buckwheat; and banana, avocado and tomato. The cross-reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before.
