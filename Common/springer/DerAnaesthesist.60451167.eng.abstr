Pollution of work areas by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide occurs during general anaesthesia. Short anaesthesia procedures are often carried out in operating theatres that are not equipped with air-conditioning systems. Methods of lovering exposure during short procedures, where mask anaesthesia is the usual procedure, are double masks and the laryngeal mask. The aim of our investigation was to determine the possibility of lowering the pollution of the environment to below national and international thresholds in a non-air-conditioned work area and to find out which method of anaesthesia is the most effective in environmental protection, i.e. which has the lowest leakage rate.
