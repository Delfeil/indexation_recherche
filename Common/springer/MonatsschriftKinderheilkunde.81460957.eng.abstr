The correlation between nutritional status and the timing of puberty is well known. Literature shows an increased incidence of central precocious puberty in children after adoption from developing countries with poor socioeconomic standard. We report the case of an Indian girl that has been adopted by German parents at the age of five years. At the age of six she showed a central precocious puberty, the progression of which could be stopped by a therapy with the GnRH-analogue Leuprorelin-acetate.
