We have seen 4 patients in 1995 who showed erysipelas in the leg used for vein graft harvesting for coronary bypass surgery. None of the patients had experienced erysipelas prior to surgery. One patient had his first attack erysipelas while the others experienced recurrent disease. Venectomy puts these patients at risk for later erysipelas. Therefore careful foot hygiene, eradication of mycotic infections and adequate therapy for initial erysipelas are mandatory in cardiac high risk patients after coronary bypass surgery.
