Nail, plate and external fixator are since decades the most frequently and stabilizers for the surgical treatment of dia- and metaphyseal fractures. These elements are still present today. However, there were important changes in recent years. Together with better knowledge and understanding of fracture healing, fracture biology, implant metallurgy and mechanics and a more and more specified application of these techniques, this resulted in improved possibilities for the treatment of injured patients. Beside an overview about the current discussion of unreamed and reamed nail insertion new trends, techniques and nails are presented for the different long bones (retrograd nails, spiral blade, flex-nail humerus and a distal aiming device (DAD) for interlocking screws). In addition, new approach techniques for nailing (stab incision) and minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) for metaphyseal fractures of the proximal and distal femur and proximal tibia are described including the necessary techniques for control of axes and rotation.
