In 1998 recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis after occupational and nonoccupational HIV exposure of the Deutsch-Österreichische AIDS-Gesellschaften were developed and published. The recommendations describe the risks of HIV-transmission and the indications of postexposure prophylaxis after occupational, sexual and injection drug use HIV exposure. In general, the use of two reverse transcriptase inhibitors (normally AZT and 3TC) and one protease inhibitor (indinavir or nelfinavir) are recommended. In consideration of individual circumstances other drugs also could be given.The antiretroviral drugs should be taken as soon as possible following exposure. Good efficacy can be expected when drugs are taken within 2 hours after HIV-exposure. During pregnancy, protease inhibitors should not be given.The official recommendations of the Deutsch-Österreichische AIDS-Gesellschaften are illustrated and discussed.
