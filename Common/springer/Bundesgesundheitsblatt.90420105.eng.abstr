In principle, haematopoietic stem cell preparations offer a paramount array of clinical opportunities and future perspectives. They are the basis for stem cell transplantation, e.g. for rescue of haematopoiesis after high dose cytotoxic therapy, for treatment of immunologic deficiencies and congenital metabolic disorders, and, in the future, a vehicle for gene therapy. Stem cells may be obtained from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. This article provides an overview of the biology of stem cells, procedures for their collection, the legal basis for the manufacture of stem cell preparations, and essential requirements for their marketing authorisation. According to German legislation, stem cell preparations are medicinal products necessitating a marketing authorisation, if they are not produced for a certain ill person, but manufactured beforehand and banked until needed.
