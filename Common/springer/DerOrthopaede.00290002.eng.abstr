The percutaneous epiphysiodesis is recommended as a save and reliable technique. We have performed 21 distal femoral, 17 proximal tibial and 3 proximal fibular percutaneous epiphyseodeses on 25 patients. On 11 patients the epiphysiodesis was caused by an average leg length discrepancy of 2,7 cm (1-4 cm). 13 patients had angular deformity near the knee joint in frontal plane (6 valgus and 7 varus deformities). One patient suffered from a combined deformity with 3,5 cm shortened leg and varus deviation of 10 °. The average deformity angle of the knee was 7,4  ° (4  °-16  °). 9 patients have reached maturity. On 3 patients the deformity could be corrected incompetely with residual deformity of 3  °, 4  ° and 6  ° as a direct result of late referral. On 1 patient an imminent over-correction could be avoided by hemiepiphysiodesis of the residual epiphysis. Till the present follow up the other patients have been corrected as calculated preoperatively. No complications like epiphysiolysis, infection, stiff knee or angular deformities occurred. We prefer the percutaneous epiphysiodesis as a save and minimal invasiv technique instead of the open Phemister-technique to tread leg length discrepancy and angular deformities of the knee in frontal plane.
