Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for up to 5 years does not increase the risk of breast cancer. Longer treatment periods lead to minimal increases in risk. Although the benefits of HRT are clear increases in breast cancer risks have to be discussed with the patients when long-term application of estrogen is performed. After primary therapy of breast cancer HRT ist contraindicated. However, it may be performed in indivudual cases when alternatives have been shown to be ineffective. This group of patients mainly suffers from severe vasomotor symptoms. Nonhormonal alternatives are often without success.
