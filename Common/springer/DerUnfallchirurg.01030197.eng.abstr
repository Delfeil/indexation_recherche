The ulnar impaction syndrome is proven to be a common source of ulnar sided wrist pain. Ulna-shortening osteotomy represents a successful therapy for this kind of problem, both congenital or posttraumatic positive ulnar variance. Positive variance resulting from a distal radius fracture needs correct dorsal and radial angulation of the radius. In case of congenital positive variance arthroscopic debridement for decompression of the TFCC should be performed first. The adequate correction of the length is the major problem. Disorders of the distal radioulnar joint may result due to overcorrection. Oblique osteotomy using 7-hole-plates is our preferred treatment.
