In a regional quality assurance project for screening mammography (German Mammography Study), 27 335 women were screened in 40 participating, office-based mammography units from 1990-1992. Screening led to 317 biopsies with a positive predictive value of 0.33. All biopsy documentation available to the mammography physicians was analysed with a view towards biopsy interval and completeness of information fed back to the Mx physicians. Biopsy recommendations were acted upon in 29 % of cases within 2 weeks. With the exception of the dignity Mx physicians were incompletely informed about biopsy results. The surgical procedure was known in the doctors' offices in 62 % of the cases. Specimen radiographies were not done regularly. A pathology report was available overall in 42 of 106 malignant cases, respectively. With the exception of the histological diagnosis itself, no variable mentioned in the reports was documented completely. Only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely. Fail-safe information are requested by Mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations. A (regional) quality assurance center should be made responsible to analyse the flow of information in mammography screening, to fill in gaps and to speed up professional cooperation.
