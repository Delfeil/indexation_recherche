The most common mechanism of pelvic fractures after blunt trauma is lateral commpression of the pelvis. Most of these fractures are of slight severity but it is possible, that a life-threatening hemorrhage can appear. The inferior epigastric artery is an atypical bleedingsite but it has to be considered in the search of the origin of the hemorrhage. Diagnostic tools are ultasound, computed tomography and angiography. After external fixation of the pelvis and persistent haemodynamic active bleeding is the percutaneous transcatheter embolization (PTE) in our opinion the treatment of choice. The introduced case is confirm with this statement.
