Backgrounds: Aim of this study was to validate a modification of adults' 13C-urea breath test for children in diagnosis of an infection with Helicobacter pylori.  Methods: In 30 asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an ELISA test specific for Helicobacter pylori. In 10 symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa. Cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal.  Results: With the serological or histological result as reference method, the cut-off value for children (delta value = 5 permil) has shown a sensitivity/specificity of 70 %/95 % or 100 %/100 % respectively. Cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly. 30 minutes after 13C-urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection.  Conclusion: Our modification of the 13C-urea breath test for children is suitable to prove an Helicobacter pylori infection.
