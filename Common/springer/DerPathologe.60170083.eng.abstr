In this paper my experience with a databank for cases with bone diseases is reported. All cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed Department of Bone Pathology of the University of Hamburg since 1970 were registered in uniform fashion. Adapting the system to state-of-the-art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment. This could not be accomplished by university resources alone, but only in cooperation with other research funds. Now 76 000 cases can be routinely accessed and scientifically analysed.
