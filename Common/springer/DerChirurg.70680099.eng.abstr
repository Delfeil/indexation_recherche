 Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is now an accepted alternative to conventional adrenalectomy. As in open surgery, several different endoscopic approaches to the adrenal glands have been described. In principle, one must distinguish between the laparoscopic and the retroperitoneoscopic access. All adrenal tumors - pheochromocytomas included - except adrenal carcinomas can be removed endoscopically. However, the use of these techniques is limited in patients with particularly large tumors. The results reported to date are convincing. Only limited data are available as yet to compare conventional and endoscopic adrenalectomy. Because adrenal diseases requiring surgery are rare, endoscopic adrenalectomy is an operation that, for the present, will be limited to centers with a particular interest in laparoscopic and endocrine surgery.
