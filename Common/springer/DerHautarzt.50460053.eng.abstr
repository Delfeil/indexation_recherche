Abstract.  A 1-year-old girl shows changes of the toenails since birth. There are no associated anomalies typical for genodermatoses, nor is there a family history of this disorder. Physical examination shows missing or incomplete toenails. In addition a shortening of the second toe on both sides and the third toe on the left side is found. The second and third toe on the left side shows incomplete syndactylia. The fingers and fingernails are all normal. Isolated congenital onychodysplasia of the toenails has not been previously reported.
