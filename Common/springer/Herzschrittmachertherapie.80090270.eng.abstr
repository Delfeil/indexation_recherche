 An essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ECG signal is the splitting of the ECG into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees, neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information. The correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria. The analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure.  This paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ECG. Unlike the methods used up to now, this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ECG signal into individual features. Furthermore, analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other.  The consideration underlying the procedure is that two ECGs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses. As this assumption is the basis of medical experience, it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ECG with those of the leads of the reference ECGs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ECG. For this purpose, those ECGs are searched in an ECG database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ECG.  The function of the method was established with the aid of the ECG signal database CARDIODAT with 249 ECGs for the diagnostic groups: infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of 550 ECGs.  It can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ECG signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts.
