Successful use of non-biologic implants in reconstructive head and neck surgery is dependent on tissue compatibility and epithelization. This is true not only for epithelial cells, but also for mesenchymatic cells. Therefore we tested several substrates with human fibroblasts or keratinocytes from the oral mucosa in cell culture. In tissue culture keratinocyte outgrowth from small mucosal flaps onto the surface was observed. Preparations were evaluated by histology and scanning electron microscopy. Cellulose-ester, polyvinylidene-difluoride and polyglactin developed monolayers of fibroblasts and keratinocytes in cell cultures. In tissue culture mucosal flaps showed good adherence to the surface of these materials and a fine outgrowth of keratinocytes. Expanded polytetrafluor-ethylene (ePTFE) was partially covered by a layer of fibroblasts and keratinocytes in cell culture, but cell adherence was not sufficient. In tissue culture the mucosal flaps failed to attach on ePTFE. These results illustrate that the mesenchymatic and epithelial component of cell and tissue cultures show different qualities of cellular adherence and growth on the surface of non-biologic implants. We propose our method for the development of an in-vitro model for the epithelization of non-biologic implantation materials.
