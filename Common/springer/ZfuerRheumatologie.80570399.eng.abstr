 Pregnancy-induced algodystrophy is per se a rare, possibly too rarely diagnosed disease, since patients with algodystrophy may be misdiagnosed as having unspecific backache, musculoskeletal problems, and ligament pain associated with pregnancy.  However, when clinical signs of beginning algodystrophia are present, immediate investigations and therapy are necessary for relief of pain and in order to prevent complications. The aim of this paper is to summarize our current knowledge on this disease. Furthermore, the clinical course and diagnostic evaluation are described in two cases with pregnancy-induced algodystrophy. The authors question the common distinction between pregnancy-induced and post-pregnancy algodystrophy, which result in a disturbed bone and calcium metabolism, but discuss both entities similary.
