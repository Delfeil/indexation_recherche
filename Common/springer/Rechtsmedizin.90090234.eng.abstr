 Some interesting data from the last annual report of the Medical Examiner's Office (San Francisco, California) are presented: annual budget US$ 3.57 million, 1733 cases examined (including 58% complete autopsies), 75 cases of homicide (primarily by shooting), 111 suicides (primarily by hanging). An interesting fact is that seven of the homicides were caused by a traffic accident. In the cases proven to have been caused by poisoning, the majority were committed by administration of morphine or cocaine.
