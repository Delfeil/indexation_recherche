Micrographic surgery is one of the most effective methods in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma. In the last 20 years this method has been further developed and modified. Three kinds of micrographic surgery are now available: the Mohs method, the margin strip method ("Tübingen torte") and the "Munich" method. All three variants have the same goal; radical tumour removal with optimal sparing of surroundind tumour-free tissue. They differ, however, in the technique of tumour excision, the preparation of the histological specimens and the interpretation of the slides. In this paper the authors take stock of the methods available and describe the differences, advantages and disadvantages.
