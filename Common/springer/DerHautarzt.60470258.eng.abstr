Leg venectasia is a common problem. Although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities, none of them gives satisfactory results. The effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor. Electrocoagulation and argon laser treatment often result in scarring. We studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of 585 nm in the treatment of leg venectasia. After repeated treatments using this laser system, only 30% of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed; we obtained better lightening of smaller red, telangiectatic vessels with a diameter up to 0.4 mm. However, hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment. In post-treatment biopsies, occlusion of the vessels was found. Based on these results, we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia. Larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy, while finer telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.
