 Arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis. Specific complications are rarely documented in literature. The perforation of an arterial Port-a-cath followed by duodenal fistula is an uncommon complication of regional hepatic chemotherapy. Besides systemic disorders caused by the chemotherapeutic agents, such as vomiting, sickness, or gastritis and duodenitis, gastroduodenal ulcers can occur as a local complication of treatment. Thrombosis of the hepatic artery or occlusion of the port device are the most common reasons for withdrawal of treatment in our series. Based on our experience and the case report of a duodenal fistula we recommend angiography of the port system prior to each cycle of chemotherapy.
