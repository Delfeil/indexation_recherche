  Ventricular ectopic activity is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Usually it is not associated with life-threatening consequences in the absence of significant structural heart disease. However, frequent ventricular ectopic beats can be highly symptomatic and even incapacitating in some patients. Currently, reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the mainstays of treatment. This study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating drug refractory monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients.
