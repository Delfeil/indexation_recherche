Objective. Post-traumatic recurrent dislocation is a major problem in the operative treatment of shoulder dysfunction in young athletes. This prospectively designed study evaluates the long-term results of a modified Eden-Hybinette procedure in young male athletes. The criteria were: capacity in sports, functional limit, and persistent pain. Genuine disorders of the glenoid or muscular imbalance of the shoulder joint were criteria for exclusion.
