The prevalence and types of psychiatric disorders in an out-patient pediatric population (pediatricians in practice; hospital out-patient department) are analysed. Nearly one forth of all 6 to 12 year old children fulfilled the criteria for a psychiatric disorder in addition to somatic disease according to a standardized documentation. The perception of a behavioural symptom is associated with further pediatric out-patient, non pharmacological treatment, but does not lead to referrals to psychotherapeutic institutions. The importance of the primary care pediatrician for the diagnosis of behavioural problems in childhood is discussed.
