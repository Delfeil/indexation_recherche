The conventional multichannel electroencephalogram is quite inconvenient for long-term monitoring in the operating theatre or intensive care unit. Recording of the EEG would be easier if a small number of channels was sufficient. Aiming at reduction of channels, leads from different regions of the scalp were analysed visually and with regard to their spectral content.
