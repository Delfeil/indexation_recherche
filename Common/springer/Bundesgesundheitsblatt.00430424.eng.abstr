Pain is a widely occurring disturbance of well-being and has serious consequences for the quality of life of patients suffering from acute or chronic pain. Thus, pain makes high demands on the health system. For the first time in the Federal Republic of Germany the National Health Interview and Examination Survey allows to make representative statements concerning the prevalence of pain, its intensity, frequency, duration and localisation. Furthermore, the results enable to differentiate according to age, gender, and social classes. The SF-36, used as an instrument to measure health related quality of life, has been employed to demonstrate the overwhelming significance of pain for the well-being of the population. In this publication the connection between certain disease syndromes like migraine and arthrosis and the prevalence of different qualities of pain is investigated. Additional more complex evaluation of the epidemiological data on pain are in preparation.
