Thoracoabdominal tumors in childhood can arise from all organs and affect children from the neonate to the adolescent. Better prognosis of childhood tumors, due to better biological understanding and improvement of chemotherapy, require sufficient radiological staging. Sufficiency in radiological staging needs modern cross-sectional techniques with high resolution, good availability and lower radiation dose. In general computed tomography (CT) is being used for radiological staging; increasingly MR imaging is being used because of multiplanar imaging techniques. Replacement of invasive techniques such as myelography and lymphography and modern cross-sectional techniques create painless staging conditions. Nevertheless, scintigraphy will always be a major examination technique, especially for evaluation of metastases and postoperative control examinations. The most common thoracoabdominal tumors in childhood and their staging are described.
