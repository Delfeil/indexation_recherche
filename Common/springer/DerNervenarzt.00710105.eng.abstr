The Stroke Unit concept of the German Neurological Society differs from its precedents in Scandinavia or the United Kingdom. Hallmarks of the German concept are very early onset of diagnosis and treatment, continuous surveillance of vital functions by bedside monitors and specialized care by a multiprofessional team. This comparison of two Stroke Units in Minden and Munich-Harlaching, working according to the new German concept, shows broad similarities in admission intervals, diagnostic procedures, treatment modalities and short term prognosis, with an exceedingly low in-hospital mortality of 3.4-5.6% and a high proportion of patients (64-69%) leaving the hospital with Barthel scores above 70. Ongoing studies will show how this kind of Stroke Unit treatment compares to general wards.
