Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) can cause ulcers of the lower limb having the character of a full thickness wound involving the subcutaneous tissues and fat. Healing requires wound contraction, connective tissue formation and finaly reepithelialisation. To induce wound healing, on an underlying disturbed environment due to longterm effects of CVI, artificial stimuli may be needed. In a placebo controlled study we tried topical application of autologous PDWHF (platelet derived wound healing factors), to achieve ulcer healing and improve the microangiopathy surrounding of the ulcer area, as there are decreased number of skin capillaries and reduction in cutaneous vascular reserve. Alterations of cutaneous circulation during the course of the study were documented by capillaroscopy, transcutaneous oxygen pressure and laser Doppler flux (LDF) measurements. We were able to recruite 15 patients all suffering from chronic nonhealing venous stasis ulcers. Eleven of the 15 patients agreed to participate in a placebo-controlled double blind study, whereas 4 patients agreed to participate only if they would be treated with PDWHF. The median age and duration of ulceration of the 6 patients (3 male/ 3 female) treated with placebo were 71 years and 1089 days. The median age and duration of ulceration of the 9 patients (1 male/ 8 females) treated with PDWHF were 66 years and 732 days. Duration of therapy for the PDWHF group was 91 days, as compared to 154 days for the placebo group. Despite 2 completely healed ulcers, the expensive treatment did not reveal any significant clinical advantage . In den PDWHF group an ulcer area of 26.9 cm2 was measured at the beginning, of 26.2 cm2 at the end; in the placebo group, 34.7 cm2 and 35.5 cm2. The nonsignificant increase of the capillary density at the ulcer border in the active group as well as the increase in the tcPO2, in contrast to little change in both parameters in the placebo group, suggests neoangiogenic abilities to PDWHF, secondarily leading to a better blood distribution with higher oxygen tension.
