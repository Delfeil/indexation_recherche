Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is rare but beset with a high mortality rate. In recent years, however, a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed. High inspiratory oxygen concentrations, large tidal volumes, and high peak inspiratory airway pressures applied during mechanical ventilation have been identified as harmful to the lung and can contribute to the progression of ARDS. This had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy. Mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ARDS have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung, prevent oxygen toxicity, recruit the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space. This new approach consists of various forms of pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation with PEEP and permissive hypercapnia, body position changes, and inhalation of nitric oxide. Should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option. None of these therapeutic procedures, however, has been tested against traditional standard treatment in a classical randomised controlled trial. The following review focuses on the latest insights into the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ARDS.
