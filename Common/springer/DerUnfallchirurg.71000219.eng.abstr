In the study presented, knee joint proprioception of 17 patients with primary degenerative joint disease of the knee joint was evaluated. As a control group, the proprioception of 30 healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestically inconspicuous knee joints was examined. We tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with an angle reproduction test. Additionally, all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage. The study showed significantly more deterioration in knee joint proprioception in patients with gonarthrosis than in the control group. Even the proprioception of the contralateral, healthy knee joint was worse than the results of the control group. However, after using an elastic knee bandage, significant improvement in the proprioceptive abilities of the injured knee joint was documented.
