The coronal incision is a versatile approach to midface or skull base fractures. It allows the open reduction of complex fracture sites and facilitates canthopexy, marginotomy or calvarian bone harvesting. By this method, primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced. All trauma patients who underwent this kind of intervention were re-examined to check functional and aesthetic results. The complication rate was low and the advantages of these techniques are evident, so that it is suggested that the indication for this operative approach should be extended.
