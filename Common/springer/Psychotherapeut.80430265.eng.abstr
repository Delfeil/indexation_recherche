In this survey we describe the development of in-patient psychotherapy based on psychoanalysis and behavioral therapy as a specific independent area of health care for the so-called pschogenic disorders. Basic structural information is given about the size of the institution - ward or special clinic -, financing, length of stay, number of staff etc. One central issue is the development of methodical procedures. Psychoanalytic concepts according to psychoanalytic therapy center around multimodal teamwork, taking into account the multidimensional transference processes, and hereby group therapy has priority. Behavioral projects stress disorder-specific, psychoeducative individual and group-therapy concepts with the central aim, the ameliorate the self-management of the patient for his/her illness. Recently, behavioral methods have been increasingly integrated into pschoanalysis-based in- patient therapies and vice versa.
