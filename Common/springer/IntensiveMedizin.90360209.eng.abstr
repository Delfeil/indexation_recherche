 A difficult airway can render mask ventilation or laryngoscopic intubation difficult or impossible. A simple physical examination can often identify the difficult airway in advance. In these cases, the knowledge of alternative methods of airway management can be lifesaving for the patient. Further, such scenarios have significant forensic implications for the physician. Fiberoptic intubation is often optimal in those situations that allow for sufficient time and the presence of the necessary equipment and a trained physician and ancillary staff. Alternative techniques such as the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and the combitube or the use of stylets and the gum elastic bougie can be employed successfully in selected patients by experienced personnel. Algorithms can promote problem awareness and devise logical steps for successfully airway management. Although surgical airway management by cricoidotomy or tracheotomy is associated with more frequent complications, it is indispensable in critical situations. Since patient safety is the foremost goal, ethical obligations demand that every physicians be familiar with techniques that ensure adequate management of a difficult airway.
