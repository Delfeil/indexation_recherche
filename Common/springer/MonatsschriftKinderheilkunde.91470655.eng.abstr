Partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance. It may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation. Although this is well established, nasogastric tubes are commonly used, because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure. A new technique for fixing orogastric tubes was tested in a prospective study in 11 preterm and term infants over a 4 weeks period. There was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in 7 patients. The orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in 3 patients and only 1 patiend aged 15 weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube. On the basis of a 3 days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86,2% for all patients and 92,5% for patients below 8 weeks of age.
