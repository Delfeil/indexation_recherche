Background: After refractive or cataract surgery, ocular optical errors can occur that are not correctable with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably responsible for the fact that in many cases the best possible (retinal) acuity is not achieved in spite of an optimum refraction. Assessment of these aberrations in the clinical routine is an important first step towards documentation and correction of these errors with modern photorefractive methods.
