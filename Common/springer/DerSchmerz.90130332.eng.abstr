Lumbar puncture (LP) is a routine technique performed for a variety of procedures, e.g. diagnosis, administration of drugs, myelography and spinal anaesthesia. Postdural puncture headache is a common complication (30-40% in diagnostic LP). Prevention can be accomplished by using small-gauge needles (<=25 G) or pencil-point needles (22 G). Therapy should be carried out in a stepwise approach. The first step is bedrest, use of analgetics, i.v. fluids and an adequate guidance of the patient.
