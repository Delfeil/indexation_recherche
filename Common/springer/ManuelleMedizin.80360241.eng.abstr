The case of a 49-year-old busdriver is referred, who died 6 days after heavy neck-ache in course of a Wallenberg's syndrome. Although neurological examination gave all the signs of a brain-stem-vessel-disease, the definite verification by ultrasound and x-rays (CT and MRI) took several days and was not out of doubts until the infarction and the occlusion of the basilar artery were complete. In an earlier state, before the neurological aspects showed acute emergency, this man might have been treated chirotherapeutically. If this had occurred, the chirotherapy might have made due for the Wallenberg syndrome without reason. To compare and asses this case, an Internet-Search was performed. Most Wallenberg's syndromes are related as spontaneous events. Only about 30 percent follow minimal neck-injuries. Only a small account of those proved as chiropractic treatments. Conclusive advise is to determine brain stem infarctions by a good neurological examination before chirotherapy. Leading symptoms of the Wallenberg's syndrome are unilateral neck-ache combined with the loss of brain-stem-nerve functions, ataxia and hypesthesia.
