Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) and interleukin 10 (Il-10) are cytokines that have a strong immunosuppressive ability. Their secretion by tumor cells is able to suppress an immunological response against tumor. Both factors have been shown to enhance tumor growth in glioblastomas and carcinoma of the breast. We determined the expression pattern of TGF- and Il-10 in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) and a possible association with tumor stage and their pre-treatment cytokine serum levels. Cytokine expression in primary tumors and metastases of 21 patients with HNSCC was investigated by immunohistochemistry. To assess the TGF-2 and Il-10 levels in tumor patients before therapy 49 serum specimens were analyzed by ELISA. TGF-2 was detected in 95% of all tumor tissues analyzed and Il-10 in 79% of all tumors. TGF-2 was localized in tumor cells and tumor borders, while Il-10 was preferentially found in peritumoral connective tissue. Metastasizing tumors showed elevated pretreatment serum levels for TGF-2 and Il-10. There was no correlation between TGF-2 and Il-10 expression in tumor tissue and pretreatment serum levels. Our data show that the majority of HNSCC analyzed express TGF-2 and Il-10. A correlation between pretherapy elevated cytokine serum levels and tumor grade was shown.
