Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) is a relatively new therapeutic approach to acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The idea of combining the intrapulmonary application of an oxygencarrying substance and positive pressure ventilation was introduced by Fuhrman in 1991 and originally called perfluorocarbonassociated gas exchange (PAGE). Nowadays, the technique is mostly known as partial liquid ventilation (PLV). The efficacy of PVL treatment has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies in different models of lung injury. The results of those studies led to multicenter phase I-II studies in patients of all age groups in the United States and Canada. Recently, the first randomized, controlled study in 90 adult patients suffering from ALI and ARDS was completed and first results have been published. Comparison of overall mortality and number of ventilator-free days (VFD's) in a 28-day period showed no differences between PLV and conventionally treated patients. A post-hoc stratification by age ( <55 years) demonstrated a tendency to lower mortality (PLV 25.6%; CMV 36.8%) and a significant increase of VFD (PLV 8.95 days; CMV 4.11 days; p=0,03) in PLV when compared to conventionally treated patients. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are chemically stable and inert. They are mostly eliminated via exhalation ( >99%). The unique physicochemical properties of PFCs permit access to atelectatic, non-ventilated lung areas, enhance gas exchange and decrease inflammation. The dense PFCs prevent the endexpiratory collapse of alveoli and reestablish functional residual capacity (FRC). Comparable to positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP), these effects have been described as "liquid or fluid PEEP". These properties offer a new approach to the underlying pathophysiology of ALI and ARDS. In addition, the combination with other therapeutic approaches to ALI and ARDS like high-frequency oscillations (HFO), inhaled nitric oxide (NO) therapy, and surfactant replacement can be considered and is already the subject of recent publications. However, combination therapy is still experimental and further investigation is necessary to evaluate efficacy and potential risks. Many questions still exist which need to be answered by experimental as well as human pilot studies. Based on these studies, the results of ongoing human trials can be assessed properly and new multicenter trials can be planned effectively.
