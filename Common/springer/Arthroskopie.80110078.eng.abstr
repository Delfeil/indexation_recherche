The purpose of this study was to compare the midterm results of the conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures in athletes. During 1989 and 1990, 279 athletes with ACL ruptures were treated in our Sports Surgery Department, and 221 of them were suitable for inclusion in the study. The patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of ACL rupture had been  made. Group I (n = 129) underwent ACL reconstruction using free bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, while group II (n = 92) received conservative treatment. We were able to evaluate 92 patients during follow-up (42 from group I and 50 from group II). The average follow-up period was 86 months. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients' age, sex, or level of sports activity. Follow-up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients. During follow-up, we used IKDC and OAK scores to evaluate the results. We found significantly better results in the group that was operated on if the patients took part in high-risk pivoting sports, but there was no difference if the patients were in the low-risk or no-risk pivoting group of athletes. Concerning reoperation and early arthrosis, the difference was significant between the two groups.
