We report on a patient suffering from epilepsy and severe personality changes. Huntington disease was diagnosed by molecular-biological investigation. Clinical characteristics are discussed on the basis of modern concepts of the genetic mechanism. Neuroradiological investigation revealed marked cerebellar atrophy, while typical findings of Huntington disease, such as caudate nucleus volume loss, were lacking. The cerebellar atrophy could be attributable either to long-term phenytoin-medication or to the pathological process itself.
