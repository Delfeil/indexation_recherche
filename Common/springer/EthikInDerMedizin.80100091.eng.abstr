Abstract.  Definition of the problem: A `experimental treatment' is defined as the use of a not yet approved medical treatment or product in a single patient outside the scope of regular clinical trials. Especially in oncology the patient is usually in a desperate situation and does not respond to other treatments. Even if he or she is fully informed about the risks he or she may occasionally make an irrational decision.
