Histological findings as regards localizing a lesion suspected to be a tumor and its relation to the margins of a surgical specimen have to be as precise as possible and beyond all doubt. We report on our experience with two technical tools which are especially helpful in excisions of breast tissue: 1) Radiopaque suture material fixed intraoperatively simplifies the correlation of postoperative mammography, X-ray findings with biopsy specimens. 2) AgNO3, as a solution or in stick form, is faster than ink or other dyes, in marking the margins in small or large surgical specimens because virtually no drying is reguired.
