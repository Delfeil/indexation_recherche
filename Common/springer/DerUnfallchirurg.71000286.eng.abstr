Between 1987 and 1993, 41 grade 3B open tibial shaft fractures were treated with the unreamed tibial nail (URTN n = 22) or an external fixator (FIX n = 19). The method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon. Three below the knee amputations were performed, three patients died, and three were lost to follow-up. In all, 32 patients were followed up to union or at least for 1 year. There were no significant statistical differences between the two groups (P<0.2, chi-squared, t-test) with respect to fracture type, fracture location, age, gender or accompanying injuries. The URTN group showed significantly better results regarding time to full weight-bearing (URTN 11 +/- 4 weeks; FIX 20 +/- 11 weeks, P<0.01 M-W) Mann-Whitney Test, number of reoperations (URTN 1.04; FIX 2.89; P<0.01 M-W), isolated bone grafting (URTN 3/22; FIX 8/19; P<0.05 chi-squared), and average Karlström and Olerud score (URTN 30 +/- 4; FIX 26 +/- 5; P<0.05 M-W). In all, 15/17 URTN patients and only 6/15 FIX patients achieved unlimited walking distance (P<0.01 M-W). Time to bony union, infection, and nonunion were not significantly different between groups.
