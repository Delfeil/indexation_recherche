Abstract:  MR-imaging of the spinal column using Turbo-Spin-Echo-Sequences (TSE) often shows flow-void structures resembling intraspinal vessels. Due to misinterpretation of those phenomenons invasive diagnostic procedures may be performed to diagnose an arteriovenous malformation (myelography, spinal angiography).
