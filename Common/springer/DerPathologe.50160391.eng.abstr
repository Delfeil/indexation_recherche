The documentation form for pathohistologic findings (version III) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented. It is part of the site-specific documentation of the German Association of Tumor Centers (ADT). Its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the ICD-O classification and the TNM system. The prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer. By means of a multicentric observational study the German Austrian Swiss co-operative group DÖSAK will develop a new prognostic model for oral and oropharyngeal cancer.
