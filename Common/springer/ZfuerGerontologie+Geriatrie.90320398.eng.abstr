 A parallel process to the aging of societies in the Western world occurs in changing family structures and network compositions. The shape of families is shifting from horizontal to vertical, where the size of generations is becoming smaller but the number of living generations is increasing. Recently there is an increased emphasis in the study of intergenerational relations on the independence of generations. The "aging of the aged", though, means the need for more care and support. It is well documented that there is continued high involvement of families in care giving. However, as the age structure of the society and the family change so does the availability and ability for care of its networks.
