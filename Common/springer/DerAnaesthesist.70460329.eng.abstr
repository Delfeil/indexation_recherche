Introduction: Recently, a compact multisensor device 0.5 mm in diameter has become available with a miniaturised Clark electrode for measuring blood oxygen tension and two optical fibres for measuring CO2 tension, pH, and temperature (Paratrend 7, Biomedical Sensors, High Wycombe, UK). We used this new probe for continuous blood gas monitoring in the jugular bulb as an alternative to the commonly used fiberoptic spectrophotometric oximetric measurement of haemoglobin saturation.
