The occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes. In babies and infants, these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia. Viral infections and/or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults (adult giant cell hepatitis, AGCH), which is much rarer. In some of the cases, there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses. Giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of HIV infection. These both indicate an infectious cause. However, the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees. Apart from our case, only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis A infection could be demonstrated serologically. In addition, the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient. This autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient, especially since a hepatitis A infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here.
