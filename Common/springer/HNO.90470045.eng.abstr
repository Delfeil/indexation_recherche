The importance of the neurobiological basis of developmental language disorders includes somatosensory modalities. Twenty-five children were diagnosed as having specific language-impairment at preschool age. All were examined with regard to their manual haptic form discrimination without visual control at a mean age of 8.7 years  +/- 7.1 months. This study group was compared to age- and gender-matched normal children of equal non-verbal intelligence (control group). Haptic discrimination was measured with the Seguin formboard on which the children were required to place ten geometrical forms in appropriate holes. Both groups differed significantly in their mean quantitative performances in favor of the control group (P<0.05). The difference in their mean performance and their mean discrimination times did not reach statistical significance. All results were not age-dependent. The control group on average performed significantly better with their left hands than the study group (P<0.05). Qualitative analysis revealed a significant difference in haptic discrimination of the pointed forms and was probably caused by inadequate exploration procedures and/or cognitive representation deficits. The results of the children with previous developmental language disorders were interpreted as an expression of an impaired cerebral maturation.
