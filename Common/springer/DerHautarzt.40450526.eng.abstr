Abstract.  Systemic PUVA photochemotherapy is widely used for a variety of skin diseases. Administration of 8-methoxypsoralen in a dilute bathwater solution may be an effective alternative therapy with no systemic side-effects and requiring smaller amounts of UVA to induce the required phototoxic response. PUVA baths of the palms and soles are an interesting alternative for dermatoses confined to these sites. This article reviews the authors' experience with PUVA bath therapy. Indications for and applications of this technique are discussed.
