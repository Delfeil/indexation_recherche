This study investigated the influence of the patients' educational level on indication for and duration of psychotherapy and the choice of treatment methods (psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy or psychoanalysis). We considered treatments that were conducted within the framework of the statutory health insurance in Germany. Data were collected from the therapists' case history (n=274), submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies. We found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy. In our sample 43.5% had graduated from senior high school compared with 25.1% in the average German population. This relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. 51.7% of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13.2% from junior high school compared with 48.7% in the average German population. Also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education, not on gender, age or type of statutory health insurance. These results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are deduced.
