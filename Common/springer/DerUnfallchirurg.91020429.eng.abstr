During 1973 and 1989, 6,378 car accidents with 8,931 injured persons were evaluated in the area of Hannover. 3,267 car drivers and passengers sustained fractures overall and 148 (4,5 %) fractures of the foot. A major role in the ethiology of the foot fractures evolves from the deformation of the foot room. Driver and front seat passenger showed similar injuries. Among the 286 single fractures, the forefoot was affected most often (45 %), followed by ankle (38 %), midfoot (11 %) and hindfoot (6 %). 5 % were open fractures. The long term results were estimated upon the limitation of working ability caused by the foot injury in relation to the entire working ability. The evaluation concludes that the foot fractures especially in combination with other injuries were frequently not recognized within the primary examination and therefore underestimated. The long-term outcome leaded to a high degree of impairment due to foot fractures.
