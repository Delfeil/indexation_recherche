Different types of gunshot injuries caused by warning weapons are demonstrated. Most important are contact shots, causing major tissue damage that can differ from that caused by classical projectiles. Possible consequences, besides direct trauma to the eye and ear, are airway distress because of extensive swelling and rupture of major neck vessels. The detailed examination includes endoscopy and radiologic imaging. Any major permanent cavity in the tissue bears a high risk of wound infection. For different reasons the fact of a gunshot wound may be kept secret by the victims.
