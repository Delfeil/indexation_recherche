Metastatic cancer to the testis is a rare phenomenon of prostate carcinoma with only 80 cases reported in the literature. Most of these secundary testicular tumors were diagnosed on routine pathohistological examination of testicular tissue after plastic orchiectomy. In none of these cases metachronous development of these metastases has been described. For the first time we report on a 75-year old patient who developed a prostate carcinoma metastatis to the right testicle three years after undergoing subcapsular orchiectomy. This case shows that the urologist has to think about a metastatic cancer when he sees a testicular tumor also after plastic orchiectomy.
