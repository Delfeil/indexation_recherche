Death and dying are taboos in society as well as in medicine. Mourning, despair, depressive crisis and infantile protest cause uncertainty in relatives, doctors and nurses. Therefore, dying patients are left alone, sometimes under inhumane conditions and without dignity. A specific method is described which allows defocussing the trauma of dying and unblocking the communications with relatives, doctors, nurses and voluntary helpers. The process of resonance with its elements of sensitivity, mood and fantasy is the centre of this method for treatment and supervision.
