Computer assisted orthopaedic surgery is a new but rapidly evolving field. Based on previous research and development in the area of stereotactic neuronavigation a few groups have adapted these technologies for the image interactive insertion of pedicle screws. The present paper summarizes past and current work in the field of computer assisted orthopaedic surgery and describes the state of the art of research and future innovations, particularly in in vivo applications.
