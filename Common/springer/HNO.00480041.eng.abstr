Lid retraction in thyroid ophthalmopathy may lead to cosmetic and functional problems. Many surgical procedures are available to correct upper lid retraction. Only those procedures should be used that lead either to a limited lid lengthening or can be reversed in cases with complications. Upper lid gold weight implantation was first used to treat lagophthalmos in patients with facial palsy. Since 1995 only a few reports have appeared which discuss plantinum as an implantation material. We report our experiences with a female patient who developed an upper lid retraction due to thyroid ophthalmopathy. Through implantation of a platinum weight which was adjusted exactly preoperatively, a symmetric palpebral fissure was achieved. Unilateral upper lid retraction with resultant eyelid asymmetry is a new indication for lid loading.
