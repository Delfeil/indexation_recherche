In primary pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) intracranial pressure is elevated by so far unknown mechanisms. There is a wide range of clinical courses. Therapy is controversial. We present a case of PTC with acute visual loss. After optic nerve sheath decompression a relapse occured. A 30-year old female patient experienced visual loss within 48 h accompanied by headache and slight neck stiffness. Visual acuity was 1/50 in the right eye; in the left eye just hand movements and light were perceived. Fundoscopy revealed a 9 dptr. prominent optic disc bilaterally. After optic nerve sheath decompression (ONSD) she improved, but underwent a relapse after 3 months. Twenty-four-hour measurement of intracranial pressure revealed elevated values. As a consequence ventriculo-peritoneal shunting was performed, leading to prominent improvement. Primary PTC can cause acute visual loss. If conservative treatment fails, different surgical procedures should be considered.
