There is little research to date about individuals who choose not to parent. This article presents empirical results on family background, sociodemographic characteristics, attitudes, marital satisfaction and interactions of voluntarily childless couples in comparison to parents. It also describes the decision process that results in not becoming a parent. On the one hand, women who choose not to parent are highly educated and employed full-time. On the other hand, they report lower incomes than parents. Several studies confirm that childless women and men rarely show a religious affiliation. They report high levels of independence and advocate equal rights in gender-role attitudes. Voluntarily childless women and men see fewer advantages to living with children. Findings show only slight differences in marital and life satisfaction between voluntarily childless persons and parents. This article summarizes psychological factors related to individuals who choose not to parent, factors that can be useful in therapeutic and counseling settings.
