The hypothenar hammer syndrome (HHS) is characterized by lesions of the ulnar artery secondary to repetitive trauma to the hypothenar eminence. We report the case of an orthopedic surgeon with HHS due to his occupational practice. Angiography and MRI confirmed an aneurysm of the ulnar artery and embolic occlusions of his carpal and digital arteries. Patency was reestablished with regional thrombolysis using rt-PA. So far there have been no reports on thrombolysis with rt-PA in HHS.
