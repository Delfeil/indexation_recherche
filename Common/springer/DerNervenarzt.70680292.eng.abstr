Septic encephalopathy (SE) is present in up to 70% of all patients with sepsis. In some cases, SE may preceed other parameters of sepsis. Loss of consciousness to a various extent is the leading symptom. CSF findings and CCT are usually unremarkable. EEG is a sensitive parameter to monitor SE. EEG-changes deteriorate in correspondence to the degree of SE. If sepsis can be treated successfully, clinical and electrophysiological signs are completely reversible. SE has a complex etiology. Bacterial endotoxins and other microbial products trigger the release of a multitude of mediators of sepsis. Due to liver dysfunction in sepsis, the brain neurotransmitter profile may be deranged. Other etiological factors include bacteriemia, liver or renal dysfunction, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, hypoglycemia and drug effects. Due to the prognostic significance of early adequate treatment, recognition of SE as a possible initial sign may be crucial for patients with sepsis.
