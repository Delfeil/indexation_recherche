  25 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD, 62  +/-  9 years) and 18 subjects free from cardiovascular disease (28  +/-  9 years) were tested on a cycle ergometer using a graded incremental test protocol: a) in the common upright position, b) as dynamic stress echocardiography in a semi-supine position. Whereas no relevant differences could be detected between the two conditions for the healthy subjects concerning heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product (2 x 3 ANOVA, t-test with -adjustment), the CHD patients showed both significantly higher heart rates as well as a significantly higher rate-pressure product (50 W: 15 300  +/-  2973 mmHg/min vs. 13 822  +/-  3042 mmHg/min; 75 W: 18 028  +/-  3479 mmHg/min vs 16 337  +/-  2619 mmHg/min) on equivalent stages during stress echocardiography if compared to the sitting position. There were no differences for systolic blood pressure in this group; the diastolic values were higher in the sitting position at rest and during 50 W. Lactate concentrations (determined only in the healthy subjects) were significantly higher on all stages during dynamic stress echocardiography. The workload at the individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) was significantly lower.
