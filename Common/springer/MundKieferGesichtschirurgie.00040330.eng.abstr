Malignant change in the epithelium of an odontogenic cyst and growth of an invasive squamous cell carcinoma is rare. The diagnosis of malignant disease is mostly only established by histological evaluation of excised tissue because the initial clinical appearance does not differ much from that of odontogenic cysts. The clinical course of one patient after removal of an impacted canine and adjacent cystic tissue is presented. Histological evaluation of the specimen led to diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma arising from the cystic epithelium. Partial resection of the maxilla was performed subsequently and 1 year postoperatively the patient was free from recurrence or metastasis. This case report underlines the importance of submitting any soft tissue excised in the treatment of odontogenic cysts to histologic evaluation.
