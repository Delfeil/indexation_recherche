Adjuvant basic therapy plays a central role  in the therapeutic approach to atopic eczema in childhood. It involves the regular use of emollients and oil baths according to the clinical picture. Emollients containing urea may cause problems when used in younger children due to their stinging effect.  Glucocorticosteroids still form the mainstay  of anti-inflammatory therapy and are superior to other topical drugs with anti-inflammatory effects. Antihistamines preferably of the sedative type can be used successfully  during periods of exacerbation. Systemic use of antibiotics is essential in cases of impetiginized atopic eczema. In cases of bacterial-triggered eczema, the topical use of antibiotics in cases of limited or of antiseptics in generalized disease may be helpful.
