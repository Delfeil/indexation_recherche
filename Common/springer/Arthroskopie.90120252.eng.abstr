Arthrofibrosis of the knee may be a localized or generalized condition. The localized forms are cylops tumors, hypertrophic cruciate grafts due to notch-impingement, and intra- or extraarticular adhaesions. These problems can usually be managed by limited, arthroscopic procedures. Generalized arthrofibrosis is caused by a diffuse inflammatory reaction of the knee with fibrosis of the anterior fat pad and the parapatellar retinaculae and contracture of the posterior capsule. Treatment should include open resection of the dense fibrotic tissue, replacing the fat pad and parts of the anterior retinaculae. In addition, open posterior capsulotomy allows for complete extension of the knee. A total of 115 cases have been treated by the authors, and the results of 53 are reported.
