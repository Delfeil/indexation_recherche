A general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given. The remission rate for untreated primary tumors is nearly 100%, for completely treated local relapses approximately 70%. The complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well-tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone. However, thromboembolism of the vertebral artery facing the internal mammary artery may occur. The indication for intraarterial chemotherapy should always be set by an interdisciplinary board.
