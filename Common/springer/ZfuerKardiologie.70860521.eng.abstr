  Autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers. Based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response, autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation. Increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude. Automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds. Thus, changes in threshold can be monitored over a long period and utilized as a diagnostic tool. This case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a microdislodgement by means of autocapture.
