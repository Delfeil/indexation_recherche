For patients with erectile dysfunction oral medication seems to be the most comfortable form of application. This can also be seen in the expectations looking forward to Sildenafil and other drugs in development. We present a prospective examination with the oral medication of 100 mg acecarbamol, 30 mg extract of cortex quebracho and 33 mg tocopherol acetate (Afrodor) in 100 patients complaining secondary erectile dysfunction. The patients were treated unselected with 3 x1 tablet/day during the diagnostic schedule. 14 % of the patients were able to perform satisfying sexual intercourse after 4 weeks of medication and another 15 % showed an increased libido. Therefore we suggest, that the application of an oral medication, might be useful, especially during the time of diagnostics. Especially for those patients who gain without invasive diagnostic tools as intracavernous injection.
