Videoendoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure for the diagnosis and therapy of sialopathies of the major salivary glands. The main indication is sialolithiasis of the submandibular and parotid glands. Sialoendoscopy offers, on the one hand, a diagnostic method for radiolucent calculi in particular and, on the other, can be used to simultaneously remove calculi. Furthermore, endoscopy is of high value for the diagnosis and treatment of other salivary gland diseases in which there are pathological changes of the ductal system. For example, regeneration of the gland is now possible in cases of chronic sialadenitis, due to the removal of a sialostenosis. Sialadenectomy can thereby be avoided.
