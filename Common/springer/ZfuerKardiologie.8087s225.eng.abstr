  Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation, as compared to inpatient rehabilitation, has substantial disadvantages for several patient groups. These drawbacks may lead to insufficient results in long term secondary prevention and to inadequate quality of life in patients with chronic heart disease. As outpatients, they remain in life circumstances which were, at least in part, causative for their heart diseases. Especially in elderly patients, those with a complicated course of disease, those who find adjusting their life style to the chronic disease state a daunting task, and those who find coping with the fact of being chronically ill as surpassing their psychological skills will find only in an inpatient setting all the relevant support delivered by a team of experts complementing each other for the benefit of the patient.
