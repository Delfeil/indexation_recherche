A report is given of two patients with a history of splenectomy many years previously due to traumatic rupture. No vaccination was given to either patient. From a state of good health, both patients developed fulminant, therapy-resistant sepsis with proof of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the blood culture. Autopsy findings were similar to Waterhouse-Friderichsen- syndrome. In conjunction with the history of splenectomy, the final pathological diagnosis was a so- called OPSI syndrome. This postsplenectomy sepsis is discussed further.
