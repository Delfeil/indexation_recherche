Neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood's epilepsy. Up to now it is not totally understood if focal EEG-pathology represents a specific cognitive deficit strongly related to the corresponding hemisphere's functions or represents a less lateralized but more general cognitive deficit of both cerebral hemispheres. In a sample of 44 pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing. As a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing (more sequential than simultaneous) has been found. There was no correlation with the localization of an EEG-Focus nor with the hand preference. According to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment. Our data indicate a possible affection of underlying metamemory functions.
