The aim of the study was to establish quantitative correlations between morphological changes at the optic nerve head (ONH) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (NFL) and functional abnormalities i. e. visual field alterations in glaucoma. A cross-sectional study of open-angle glaucoma patients of various stages was performed. Scanning laser tomographic (TopSS) assessment of the ONH and scanning laser polarimetric (Nerve Fiber Analyzer) measurements of the peripapillary NFL thickness (NFLT) were compared to results of computerized static perimetry (Octopus G-1). One eye from each of 157 glaucoma suspects (n = 58) and patients with established open-angle glaucoma (n = 99) was assessed. The parameter "modulation" (difference between maximum and minimum of NFLT) gave the best correlation (r2 = 0.23) to the visual field index for mean sensitivity. Tomography gave the best correlation between the neuroretinal rim area at the inferior and superior pole of the ONH and the visual field index loss variance (r2 = 0.20). Conventional planimetric data of the ONH and clinical assessment of the NFL yielded slightly better correlations to the visual field data than the scanning laser tomography or polarimetry. Although NFL parameters are more complicated to obtain, they yield better correlations to diffuse visual field loss than parameters of the ONH. The new scanning laser techniques do not improve these correlations between morphology and function; however, they allow objective assessment of ONH and NFL parameters without mydriasis.
