Abstract.  The prevalence of type I allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire, prick tests and the determination of specific IgE antibodies. Positive prick tests against different latex fluids were found in 18 (8.7%) of 206 students, with clinical relevance in 11 cases. When the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2% in the second semester to 10.4% in the tenth semester was seen. A history of glove intolerance presenting as a wheal-and-flare reaction was associated with a type I allergy against latex in only 50% of the affected subjects. Atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in 16 and 5 of 18 students with latex allergy, respectively. A high-ammonia accelerator-free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific IgE antibodies to latex.
