  In view of a possible Stent implantation, 20 infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated. Measurements were performed according to toporegional criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters. Then we correlated the extent of the proximal and distal necks to the aneurysmal lengths and diameters, respectively. The following results were obtained: 1. Depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm, there is an inproportional shortening of the proximal and distal neck. Up to an aneurysmal length of 4 cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases. 2. With lengths of more than 4 cm according to the morphological results, the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple Tube-Stent. 3. The proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of 10 cm. For longer aneurysms, only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation. In all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall-adherent thrombi of up to three centimeter thickness in the aneurysmal and para-aneurysmal regions. These findings have to be considered, with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta.
