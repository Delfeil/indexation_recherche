 In 1994 the number of kidney donors once again decreased in Germany. On the other hand, more and more old people are being considered for renal transplantation; thus the shortage of transplants is becoming more severe. The kidneys of elderly donors might improve this situation. The results available are inconsistent. There is no doubt that kidney function declines with age, but the individual aging process depends mainly on concomitant disease, especially arterial hypertension. Transplantation of kidney from an elderly person requires appropriate selection of donors as well as good perioperative management. Doctors in medical intensive care units should contact transplant centres more often to evaluate potential elderly kidney donors. More open-minded assessment of certain situations is necessary in conservative medical disciplines.
