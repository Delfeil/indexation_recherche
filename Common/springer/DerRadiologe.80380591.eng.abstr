Purpose: To evaluate the image quality of magnetic resonance venography (MRV) of pelvic and abdominal veins. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all MRV between 1993 and 1996 was conducted. A 2D-FLASH-TOF without breath hold and with arterial presaturation was used. All venous segments have been assessed for the quality of visualisation and an overall image quality was determined. 43% of our patients had malignant disease and phlebothrombosis had already been diagnosed in 64%.
