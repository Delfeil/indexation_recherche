 Although rationing is an important feature in the German health care system, this topic is not discussed in an explicit and structured way. Currently, most rationing decisions are not based on systematic data on costs and outcomes of diseases and medical interventions. A major task of future research will be to provide health policy makers with data on direct costs, indirect costs, effectiveness, and utility of medical interventions and to integrate these data into decision analysis models. Interdisciplinary workgroups should be set up, combining clinical and economic knowledge. On the other hand, official grants are needed to perform unbiased research in this field covering the various areas of medical care.
