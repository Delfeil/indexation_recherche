A metaanalysis on pharmacological and psychological treatment reports was conducted in order to evaluate the overall effectiveness of these treatment conditions in chronic tinnitus. A totality of 109 treatment studies published between 1976 and 3/1995 and meeting minimal inclusion criteria was located, but only 24 studies reporting sufficient information could be analyzed. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated by a coding scheme, and the resulting index of effectiveness has been weighted by this standard as well as by sample size. Effect sizes of pharmacological studies were ES=1.27 and by this higher than the ones for psychological studies with ES=0.88. This finding is attenuated by high (unspecific) placebo effects of ES=0.65 in pharmacological studies compared to ES=0.10 in psychological studies. In general, patients from psychological studies further improve after treatment in cases where catamnestic measurements have been conducted.
