Arthrofibrosis represents a severe complication of trauma and surgery around joints with loss of motion due to an excessive fibrotic response in the repair process. Patients with primary arthrofibrosis suffer from a general fibrotic healing response after injury or surgery, while patients with secondary arthrofibrosis exhibit loss of motion due to a local fibrotic healing response. Nonisometric positioning of cruciate ligament grafts, notch impingement or hardware problems may lead to secondary arthrofibrosis. In contrast, the etiology of primary arthrofibrosis is still unknown. There are alterations of the extracellular matrix with an increase in collagen type VI expression similar to other local or systemic fibrotic disorders. A chronic inflammatory process may play a crucial role in the mechanism of primary arthrofibrosis and may indicate an immune response. This immune response may activate inflammatory cells and stimulate resident cells to proliferate and to form extracellular matrix. We still do not know which stimuli trigger the fibrotic response. It may be reasonable to assume that primary arthrofibrosis is an independent disease while secondary arthrofibrosis represents a true complication of trauma and surgery around joints.
