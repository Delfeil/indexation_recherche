 Regional perfusion of the lung is not distributed homogeneously within the organ. This phenomenon has been explained by the classical concept of West et al. based on the isolated canine lung. The concept stresses the importance of different gravitational forces along the vertical axis of the lung resulting in three zones in which no pulmonary perfusion (zone 1), waterfall-like perfusion (zone 2), and continuous blood flow (zone 3) prevail. In this article, we review recent publications in which observations have been made which cannot be explained by the West model. A new concept of distribution of regional pulmonary perfusion is presented which centers on vascular factors which are better suited to account for observed blood flow heterogeneities. The pulmonary vasculature is composed of repetitions of one structural unit: the vessel bifurcation. Apart from its size, each single bifurcation is similar to all others. The pulmonary vessel tree can, therefore, be considered to be self-similar. Self-similarity has been identified as a design principle of living nature. Self-similar objects can produce heterogeneity which is also self-similar when viewed at different scales of magnification. For measurement of the structure of such objects and their function, i.e., in this case the heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion, fractal geometry is best suited. Distribution of blood flow within the lung can be described by means of fractal analysis, and all phenomena of perfusion distribution can easily be explained when applying this concept. Furthermore, since the basis of fractal analysis is pulmonary vascular anatomy, it lends itself for the study of blood flow distribution. A major advantage is the independence of fractal parameters from resolution of perfusion measurements. Thus, fractal analysis can be used to compare results that have been obtained using different resolutions and different species. Fractal methods have previously been used in medicine for other purposes. Nonlinear analyses of heart beat variability can predict the onset of malign cardiac dysrhythmias hours before actual appearance in the ECG. Very similar methods applied to electrical brain activity have been shown to allow prediction of epileptical seizures approximately 15 min prior to appearance of clinical symptoms.
