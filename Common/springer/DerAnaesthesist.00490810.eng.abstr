From January 1997 until June 1999, the complete durations of stay of 3152 outpatients were entered into a computerized documentation system. The scope of the data entry went from patient admission to patient release. The objective was to determine the usefulness of the anaesthesia information management system (AIMS) in producing complete and high-quality documentation in the field of outpatient operations. Some aspects and results from routine work are presented here.
