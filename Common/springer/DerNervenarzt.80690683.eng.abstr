Magnetic resonance imaging represents today the most important tool in neuroradiology for both clinical pratice and research. MRI allows imaging of the human body in 2 or 3 dimensions with variable tissue contrast. The natural diffusion of tissue protons can now be used as a supplementary contrast mechanism. Different MRI techniques can be used to obtain clinically useful diffusion-weighted images. These techniques all require the use of strong gradient pulses in order to obtain the diffusion contrast. In the current article, the most important physical principles of diffusion measurement are presented. After a short introduction into the basic physical principles, we will present the prerequisites and limitations of clinically relevant applications today. Finally a few select examples of clinical use of these techniques in the acute diagnosis of stroke will be presented.
