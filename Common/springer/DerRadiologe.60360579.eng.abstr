Purpose: The aim of this prospective study was not to describe individual morphological findings in benign and malignant solitary intrapulmonary nodules; it was instead to examine in a critical manner the indications for differentiation found in the literature in order to facilitate safe differential diagnosis of benign and malignant nodules. Patients and methods: A total of 64 solitary pulmonary nodules were examined with high-resolution computed tomography and correlated with histological findings. Only lesions that had been removed by surgery were used. No lesion was excluded on the grounds of size. Results: Useful characteristics for the differentiation of benign from malignant pulmonary nodules were: diameter and density of the lesion, air inclusion, unsharp and dystelectatic margin, the presence of spicules, length of spicules, spicules extending to the visceral pleura, pleural tail sign and cirumscribed pleural thickening. Conclusion: For the differentiation of benign and malignant solitary pulmonary nodules meticulous assessment of the margin of the nodule is necessary. Using the criteria mentioned, a sensitivity of 85 % and a specifity of 78 % can be achieved for the identification of malignant pulmonary nodules. Since it was not possible to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules with certainty using imaging methods, the chance of patient survival could only be promoted by early surgery.
