Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors and parasympatholytic drugs are often used as analgetics in the case of renal colic. This paper analyzes how and whether these drug effects are important for the analgetic therapy. In an animal and in a human model with acutely obstructed kidneys we found that intravenous application of Indometacine and dipyrone significantly reduces renal pelvic pressure. The parasympatholytic drug hyoscine butylbromide did not produce any change of upper urinary tract dynamics. Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis thus effect pressure reduction in the renal pelvis, which is necessary for analgetic therapy. In contrast, hyoscine butylbromide does not have any influence on the acute upper urinary tract obstruction; consequently its usefulness in the treatment of renal colic is rather doubtful.
