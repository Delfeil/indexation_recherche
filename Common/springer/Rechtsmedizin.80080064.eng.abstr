 In a double-blind study with 31 volunteers, disturbances of cognitive performance following the uptake of 15 mg oral midazolam were examined by a standardised and validated test (SKT). The degrees of impaired cognitive efficiency were comparable to those of moderate or serious organic psychosyndrome. Furthermore, a complete anterograde amnesia without any tendency to clarify was obvious in all cases. Disturbances of motor coordination were particularly evident from a rotatory nystagmus which showed a prolonged coarse tremor in 25 volunteers. All subjective and objective effects were limited to a time period of 3-6 h after midazolam administration.
