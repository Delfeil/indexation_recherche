The extent of radiogenic salivary gland damage depends on the radiation dose, the fractionation, and the localization of the gland in the radiation field. Because extracellular matrix proteins, for example collagen IV, belong to the main components of basement membranes (BM), which are considered to posses cell- and structure-regulating functions, this study set out to describe radiogenic BM changes. The staining profile of collagen IV was studied in 110 female rat mandibular glands depending on age (1 year vs. 1 1/2 years), dosage (2 Gy/d; total dosages 20, 40, or 60 Gy), the radiation field (inside vs. outside), and on the latency period (1/2 year vs. 1 year), using immunohistochemical methods. The stainings were assessed semiquantitatively and differences were evaluated using multivariate analysis. The staining pattern of the polyclonal antibody in rat tissues did not differ from the pattern found in human salivary glands. Collagen IV was detected at variable levels in the glandular and nerve tissue and in vascular walls (negative: adventitia). Irradiated tissues were stained more strongly than non-irradiated, and differences were significant in salivary glands exposed to more than 20 Gy. Age and the latency period had no significant effect on staining. The BM constituent collagen IV showed dose-dependent increasing expression analogous to the salivary gland damage, which could contribute to disturbed cell-matrix interactions following salivary gland radiation exposure. Several tissue structures may be more sensitive to possible scattered radiation. Information on the pretreatment status is mandatory in histopathological studies on the BM of salivary glands.
