The utilization of in vitro angiogenesis in tissue engineering might be useful in order to establish an artificial vascular network. However, it remains unclear how far the in vitro preformation of vascular structures may contribute to the perfusion of larger artificial tissue aggregates regarding the improvement of oxygenation and nutrition. In an in vitro study, we developed a model of a vascularized tissue. Stromal cells of a target tissue, e.g., adipose tissue or bone tissue, were expanded in vitro and seeded onto microcarriers or microparticles. Densely covered microcarriers were brought into a fibrin matrix together with endothelial cells. In order to demonstrate the formation and stabilization of capillary-like structures, UEA-I labeled specimens were evaluated using laser scanning microscopy and digital image analysis. The stabilization of capillary-like structures was better with stromal cells from bone marrow than from adipose tissue. In one of the culture aggregates, the total length of capillary-like structures increased after 6 weeks of cultivation to up to 140 mm/mm3. Additional tests were performed utilizing hyperbaric oxygenation. In the oxygenation group, a significant increase in the length of capillary-like structures was found. The method implies the option of coculturing different tissue elements and of an in vitro preformation of vascularized tissues.
