 The developement and improvement of the cryosurgical technique in combination with intraoperative ultrasonographic imaging enables reliable destruction of liver tumors - although not free of complications - given that tried and tested rules of cryosurgical research are obeyed. In this respect, we can speak of real progress. On the basis of a 3-year testing phase with the CRYO6 cryosurgical apparatus from ERBE, a protocol for the cryosurgical technique for liver tumors is introduced. The spectrum of indications for cryosurgery includes the destruction of irresectable hepatic secondaries or primary tumors with curative intention and the freezing of insufficient or incomplete resection margins. The preliminary results of this treatment modality are encouraging. However, there remains a need for further clinical research to allow final judgement of the cryosurgical method.
