The application of bovine surfactant has become a standard therapy for preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. During the first few years after introduction, the preferred administration mode was a bolus injection via a nasogastric or suction tube placed inside the intratracheal tube. Negative effects associated with this kind of administration include: loss of PEEP and interruption of ventilation during application; increased risk of infection due to disconnection from the ventilator; acute tube obstruction with consecutive rapid changes of cerebral perfusion and systemic arterial blood pressure. To decrease these risks, surfactant infusion - either by special tube connectors with lateral aperture or a special endotracheal tube with integrated application channel - has been favoured by some centres. Beneficial effects such as continuous ventilation, gradual increase in oxygenation, avoidance of circulatory problems and intracerebral hemorrhage are likely when surfactant is administered continuously and slowly via the medicine channel of a special tube. We report the cases of three preterm infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome. In spite of correct placement of the nasotracheal tubes, surfactant administration via the medicine channel resulted in asymmetric ventilation and persistent left-sided atelectasis. A jet-stream effect due to rapid instillation seems to be responsible for the uneven surfactant distribution and subsequent ventilatory disorder. To avoid these problems, we recommend administering the substance slowly at infusion rates of 0.5 ml/min or less, using small syringes of 2 or 5 ml.
