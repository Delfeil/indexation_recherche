Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis vulgaris belong to the most common diseases in dermatology. Since these chronical diseases progress over years and decades, they may lead to restrictions in private and professional life as well as to psychological stress of concerned patients. Therefore a lasting, stabilising, stage-adjusted topical treatment is necessary. Main component of this treatment in a complete therapeutical concept consists in an adjuvant basic therapy with oil baths and with emollients containing urea or no drug additives at all. Thus the vehicle itself is therapeutically effective. Altered structure and function of the skin measured by increased transepidermal water loss, dysfunction of skin lipid barrier, augmented skin permeability and skin roughness can be improved. Due to this treatment clinical symptoms can be diminished and relapses can be avoided. Corticosteroids and other specific medications can be reduced by using basic therapeutics with little side effects. This means economical benefit as well. So far adjuvant basic treatment is an essential part in the therapy of chronic inflammatory skin diseases.
