 In this review therapeutic strategies for neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas are proposed, based on the recent classification. Generally, for all neuroendocrine tumors even with obvious metastases, surgery is recommended. Particularly for neuroendocrine tumors of the upper intestinal tract and the pancreas an extensive preoperative clinical and histopathological diagnosis is required. We tried to simplify the therapeutic strategies according to the classification; in several cases, however, very close cooperation between gastroenterologists, surgeons and pathologists is necessary to decide on the appropriate therapeutic strategy.
