Abstract.  Introduction: Liver transplantation is the method of choice for metabolic diseases and end-stage liver failure. Methods: At the Klinikum Groﬂhadern we have performed liver transplantation for inborn errors of metabolism in 24 patients (5.3 % of all transplantations, 16 adults, age 39  +/-  13 years; 8 children, age 9  +/-  3 years); 19 patients received a transplant for end-stage liver disease, and in 5 cases because of fulminant hepatic failure. Results: Twenty-four patients received 27 transplants. In 3 cases, a split-liver transplantation was performed; one patient received a combined lung-liver graft. The 5-year survival rate for children is 100 % and for adults 68 %. Conclusions: Liver transplantation for inborn errors of metabolism not only replaces the diseased organ, but also leads to complete reversal of the metabolic defect.
