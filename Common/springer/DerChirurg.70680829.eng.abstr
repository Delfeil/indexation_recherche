 Acute compartmental syndrome (CS) is a surgical emergency. Different conditions in which high non-physiological pressure appears within a closed fascial space reduce the necessary blood perfusion. CS is caused by trauma, burns, bleeding in patients with coagulopathies, arterial injuries, nephrotic syndrome or unusual physical exercise with secondary compartmental swelling. When decompression occurs too late, permanent loss of function and limb contracture may result. In the following paper we report on a case of four-compartmental syndrome in the lower legs of a patient with drug intoxication. After cannabis consumption, the patient fell asleep sitting cross-legged. During our first examination several hours later, the signs of compartmental syndrome with spontaneous pain, turgid swelling and paresis were present. Bilateral skin incision technique was used to gain entrance into the four compartments in both lower legs. Immediately after the operation, the patient showed crush syndrome with high serum creatine kinase activity 140.501 U/l and acute renal failure caused by rhabdomyolysis. Within 2 weeks of haemofiltration and dialysis, a full recovery to a normal serum creatinine level of 0,7 mg/dl was achieved. After emergency treatment and rehabilitation, the patient showed neither vascular nor neural defects.
