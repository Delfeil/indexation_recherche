 Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a new concept in the treatment of recurrent and primary advanced colorectal tumors. Between October 1994 and December 1997 27 patients (primary tumor: 8, first recurrent tumor: 12, second recurrent tumor: 7) received IORT (32 applications). Chemotherapy and percutaneous radiotherapy had already been given to all patients with advanced and recurrent colorectal tumors. The intraoperative irradiation was performed through HDR iridium afterloading. A flexible flab - individually adapted to the "tumor bed" - was used as applicator. The contact dose ranged from 10 to 15 Gy. The mean operation time (rectum resection: 5, rectum amputation: 14, debulking: 8) increased by 30 min on average. Eight patients had postoperative complications: perianal wound infections (3), sacrovesical fistulas (3), leakage of anastomosis (1) and neural ureter dysfunction (1). To date - on average 17.1 months (range: 3-33) after operation - 13 patients are free of tumor recurrence or show stable disease. Ten patients - all of them had macroscopic residual tumor - have local tumor progression combined with good quality of life. Only 4 patients died (acute kidney failure, stroke, marasmus, systemic progression). The afterloading flab technique represents a technically simple, minimally harmful procedure in the therapy of colorectal tumor. Even when IORT with electrons is not feasible or the patients have already been irradiated, a higher radiation dose is possible. Given the demonstrated rate of local tumor recurrence, the afterloading flab technique seems to be a valuable treatment alternative to extended, high-risk resections. Long-term follow-ups will be necessary.
