We conducted a prospective evaluation of 301 consecutive renal transplants to define the prevalance and therapy of lymphoceles following renal transplantation. Using a management scheme, we identified in 52 patients (17.3 %) perirenal fluid collections. Using this management scheme, we treated 47/52 patients conservatively. Only 5 (1.7 %) patients required internal marsupialization. We conclude that groin lymphocysts after renal transplantation can be successfully treated with conservative methods.
