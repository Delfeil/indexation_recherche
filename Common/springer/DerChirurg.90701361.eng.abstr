We report on a case of subacromial shoulder dislocation, which resulted from a combination of a cranial glenoid fracture and an acromial fracture. The patient sustained this rare injury while playing handball. The whole implication of the injury was revealed only after extensive workup with CT scan of the shoulder. After reduction of the shoulder dislocation, the glenoid fracture was stabilized by osteosynthesis. The postoperative results showed anatomical reconstruction of the glenoid joint surface. After completion of therapy, the patient has achieved good functional results with a full range of motion (abduction 180  °) and has been able to work full-time again.
