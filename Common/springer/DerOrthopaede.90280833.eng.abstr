Advances in MRI technology have greatly improved visualization of the radio-carpal region. With todays high-resolution imaging, even very small anatomic structures like the triangular fibrocartilage may be seen. Established indications include the osteonecroses (scaphoid and lunate); however, MR images always should be evaluated in conjunction with plain radiographs. By delineating bone marrow edema, MRI is well suited for the detection of microfractures. Visualization of small soft tissue tumors, soft tissue extension of bone tumors and for staging of tumors in general may also be regarded as indications generally agreed upon. Promising indications include pathology of ligaments and similar structures.
