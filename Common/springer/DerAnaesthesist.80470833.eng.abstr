Background: The detection or ruling out of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) can be determined noninvasively by contrast echocardiography (CE). The transesophageal technique is superior to the transthoracic technique regarding sensitivity, whereas the specificity of both methods is equally high. This prospective study shows the rational use of transesophageal CE for the detection of a PFO, in patients without cardiovascular disorders.
