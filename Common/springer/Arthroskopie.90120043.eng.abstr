Autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) is a cell based therapy for treatment of full thickness cartilage defects. ACT induces chondroneogenesis at defect sites leading to formation of tissue that duplicates the structure, composition, mechanical properties and durability of articular hyaline cartilage. The newly formed tissue is fully integrated with the surrounding cartilage. The arthroscopical and histological evaluation of the repaired cartilage tissue showed no arthritic changes. ACT treatment results in normal, symptom-free joint function without deterioration over years. The ACT-induced repair of hyaline cartilage is dependent on the proliferative capacity and differentiation stage of the cultured autologous chondrocytes. Quality management of manufacturing, testing, packaging and shipment of autologous chondrocyte transplantates is required for their approval as biological. Quality assurance of approved chondrocyte transplantates and standardized surgical procedure are essential for the long-term success and safety of ACT treatment.
