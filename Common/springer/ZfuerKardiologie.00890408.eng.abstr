 Objective: The revised Edwards-Duromedics valve was introduced onto the market in June 1990. In September 1993, the producer changed the name of the valve to TEKNA, which is a low profile, bileaflet, mechanical prosthesis with a self-irrigating hinge mechanism. The results of a prospective follow-up study after valve replacement with this prosthesis are presented.
