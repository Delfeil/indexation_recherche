The treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative. The immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments, with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist. A graduated treatment scheme based on the ASIF classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur. The majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means; operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement. The authors' own patient population is presented in this paper: in these patients fixation with Kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used, followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty, and for C-type fractures according to the ASIF classification or when there is severe soft-tissue damage, application of a fixateur externe spanning the joint has proved best. Treatment strategy, risks, complications and results are presented.
