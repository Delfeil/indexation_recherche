Acute suppurative thyroiditis is very rare in childhood. We describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children, and add 2 own cases of this rare disease. In the first case, diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid. Operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then. In the second case, a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only. Seven years later, no recurrent abscess occurred in this child. In conclusion, especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection. If present, complete removal of the fistula is essential for permanent cure.
