Ejaculated spermatozoa and spermatogenic cells express - and -chains of 1-, 3- and 4-integrins as well as their ligands laminin and fibronectin. These adhesion molecules (AM) showed an extended intra- and interindividual variation and different patterns of location. The mRNA transcripts of the AM were detectable by nested polymerase chain reaction in the spermatozoa. The conclusion of a functional competence of the AM was supported by the correlation of the AM-expression on the spermatozoal surface after the acrosome reaction with three function tests: (i) the zona-free hamster oocyte penetration (HOP) test, (ii) the in vitro fertilization of human oocytes and (iii) the cell attachment assays. AM labelling was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma, and micro organisms. In contrast, the sperm cryopreservation did barely influence the labelling of spermatozoal AM.
