By means of modern color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) even very small vessels can be visualized. Maximum resolution nowadays is about 0.5 mm diameter of the vessel. We compared the use of CCDS and angiography in studying of acral perfusion. Besides morphologic criteria, hemodynamic criteria were recorded. Arteries in healthy fingers appear as long and straight vessels with a clearly defined border. The physiological maximal blood flow velocity exceded 20 cm/s. CCDS revealed tortuosity of finger arteries as typical finding in thrombangiitis obliterans. Segmental stenosis can either be identified morphologically or quantified by measurement of the flow velocity with poststenotic maximal systolic velocities of less than 20 cm/s or by the acceleration of the blood flow within the stenosis, as proven by angiographic examinations. CCDS is suitable for evaluation of acral perfusion in patients suffering from secondary Raynaud's syndrome. Apart from diagnosis of disturbed acral circulation, other possible applications of CCDS are in in the surgical field, for example replantations in hand or finger surgery.
