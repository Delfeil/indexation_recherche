 In the present study, a retrospective statistical analysis of laboratory data, clinical data, and perioperative blood requirements from 300 primary orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT) is described. Methods. OLT was performed using established surgical techniques and total IV anaesthesia. Volume was substituted with red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) according to haemodynamic data, haemoglobin, and diuresis. Platelet counts, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time, fibrinogen, and antithrombin III were registered but not used as indications for transfusions. Statistics were performed using regression analysis and analysis of variance. Results. The mean intraoperative fluid requirement was 793 ml balanced salt solution, 7.1 units RBC, and 8.4 units FFP; pooled random donor platelets were given only once. During 24 h postoperatively, an average of 1.8 units RBC and 4.6 units FFP had to be transfused. Currently, 278 of the 300 patients (92.7%) are alive. There was no significant correlation between clotting data and intraoperative blood use; for postoperative transfusion rates, the preoperative aPTT and postoperative platelet counts had a significant correlation. Reviewing the basic diseases of the patients, there were significant differences in coagulation status, but no differences in transfusion rates. Conclusion. According to the data presented, indications for transfusions in OLT according to clotting data are not valid, since these data do not correlate with the blood requirement. In addition, strategies for pretreatment of patients such as preoperative plasmapheresis are no longer justified with respect to possible side effects.
