The ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications. In patients with liver disease with portal hypertension, however, the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit bleeding is increased. While the diagnosis is simple, several therapeutic options are available. In most cases the bleeding comes from stomal varices, that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3% Ethoxyscerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel. The resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised. If bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered. Malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source.
