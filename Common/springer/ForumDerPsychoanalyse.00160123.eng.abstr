This presentation of a short therapy as it occurs in everyday practice intends to show that such a short therapy can be carried out psychoanalytically (in the sense of working with resistance, transference, and countertransference) even if a focus is not specifically worked out at its beginning but the therapist follows the mise en scène of a conflict on the basis of his/her countertransference instead, after having interactionally determined grounds for treatment. Countertransference offers not only an effective access to the perception of the interaction but it also drives on the process as such. The unconscious dialogue between patient and analyst as well as the conflict management within the therapist in addition to his/her abstinent non-intervention and explicit interpretation play an important role. If the process gets underway the relevant data emerge as it were 'on their own', supporting, supplementing, and correcting the respective therapeutic hypothesis and in this way putting it on increasingly firmer ground. The time-limit catalyses and intersifies especially the separative aspects of the emerging conflicts. As cognition and relationship develop reciprocally a therapeutic relationship is being established which is capable of sustaining the strains of intensification on the basis of growing insight.
