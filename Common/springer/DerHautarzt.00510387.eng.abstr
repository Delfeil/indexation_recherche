Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with celiac disease. IgA antibodies to endomysium are considered as sensitive and specific markers for celiac disease. Recently, tissue transglutaminase was identified as the antigen of anti-endomysium antibodies. Moreover, serum levels of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase were found to correlate with titers of IgA antibodies to endomysium in patients with both celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. These findings confirm the close pathogenic relation between the two diseases. The determination of serum levels of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase may be a tool that can be routinely used for the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis in the future.
