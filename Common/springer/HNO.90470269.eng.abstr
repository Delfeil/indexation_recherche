The clinical courses of vocal rehabilitation of patients with different degrees of laryngeal paralysis can proceed very differently, but usually do not correspond with the physical changes of glottic function seen on laryngoscopy and stroboscopy. In this study 43 patients with laryngeal paralyses were examined, of whom 28 had regeneration of nerve function. Fifteen did not show any improvement in glottal function. All patients were asked to describe their voices, after which subjective data were compared to objective findings concerning vocal penetrating capacity were found to be valid in reflecting therapeutic effects and for estimating voice capability.
