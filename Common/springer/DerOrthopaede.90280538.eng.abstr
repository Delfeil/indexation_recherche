Based on the one experience and the information that is available in the literature indications for ankle arthroscopy are given, surgical equipment, patient placement and surgical technique of different procedures are described. Finally the results and possible complications are presented. Removal of loose bodies as well as synovectomies in case of an acute infection or rheumatoid arthritis are good indication. Arthroscopic treatment of anterior pathology in the athletic ankle need a thorough diagnostic work-up; the results of the treatment do not always meet the expectations of this especially demanding population. Cartilage treatment is technically possible, however, long term results are still missing. This is also true for the treatment on osteochondritis dissecans. In patients with degenerative joint disease arthroscopic debridement can only lead to a temporary benefit. Arthroscopic assisted arthrodeses (AAA) is technically demanding, but can serve as an excellent alternative to conventional open techniques. The complication rate in ankle arthroscopy is high compared to other joints, which is especially true for neurologic complications and postoperative infections. This should be addressed when performing the informed consent.
