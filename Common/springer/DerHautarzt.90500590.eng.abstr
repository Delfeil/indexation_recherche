The case of a 30 year old man with acatalasemia is presented. The congenital disorder  is charaterized by a lack or major reduction of catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water. The defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Occasionally the defect manifests as progressive oral gangrene or Takahara's, disease.
