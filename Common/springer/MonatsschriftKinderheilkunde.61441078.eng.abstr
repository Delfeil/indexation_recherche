 Background: Clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamylphosphate-synthetase (4), argininosuccinate-synthetase (2) and argininosuccinate-lyase (2) ) are described.  Methods/Therapy: Emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i. v. as well as peritoneal dialysis and/or modified hemodialysis. Chronic treatment comprised a low-protein diet and substitution of essential amino acids, of benzoate or phenylbutyrate and of branched-chain amino acids.  Results: Within 72 hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed, leading to developmental retardation later in life. Four patients died between 2 weeks and 4 years of age. During follow-up, all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively. Phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side-effects than benzoate, branched-chain amino acids had favourable effects. One patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development.  Conclusions: Neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder. Specific therapy as described can be life-saving, although most children exhibit marked developmental delay. Long-term prognosis is poor. Sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side-effects than sodium benzoate. Therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications.
