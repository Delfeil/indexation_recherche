 The reappearance of incisional hernias after reconstruction depends on the size and tension of the hernia. An additional risk factor is the number of operations that have been performed before. There are two decisive factors that influence the rate of recurrence: the operation technique and the tension applied. To reach a functional reconstruction the incisional hernia must be closed and the abdominal wall must be joined together in an anatomical way. The technique used must be able to tolerate the tension which is necessary to close the abdominal wall. Application of arbitrary tension produces a high rate of recurrence, irrespective of the kind of reconstruction used. Through the intraoperative measurement of the tension applied one can match each hernia (according to size, value and tension) to the most suitable technique. Here the inlay/onlay technique tolerates the highest tension, up to 3.5 kp. With this method and a maximum tension of 3.5 kp we achieved a complete functional reconstruction in 65 % of cases and our rate of recurrence amounted to 2.3 %.
