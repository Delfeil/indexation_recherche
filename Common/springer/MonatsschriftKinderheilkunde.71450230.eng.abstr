The persistent Müllerian duct syndrome is characterized by the presence of uterus, tubes and proximal vagina in patients with normally virilized genitalia and a 46,XY karyotype. The clinically typical constellation of inguinal hernia and contralateral cryptorchidism should therefore lead to a thorough sonographic evaluation of the abdomen. We report on 3 patients in whom the abnormalities were discovered during surgery for inguinal hernia or cryptorchidism. One patient underwent resection of the Müllerian structures. Histological examination showed resection of both vasa deferentia, which ran parallel to and within the lateral walls of the uterus. The gonadal biopsies of two patients evidenced degeneration of testicular tissue by showing a fifty percent reduction of spermatogonias. Discussion: Therapy of this syndrome consists in early bilateral orchidopexia, aiming at preservation of endocrine and reproductive testicular function and prevention of malignant degeneration. The integrity of the vasa deferentia should not be endangered during surgery.
