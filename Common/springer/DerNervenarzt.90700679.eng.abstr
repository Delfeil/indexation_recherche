For the ussage as blood substitutes perfluorocarbons (PFC) have been developed as artificial oxygen carriers. In addition they may have potency for protective use in ischemic tissue. Formulation improvement achieved higher oxygen carrying capacity and better compatibility than the first generation of PFC. Preclinical studies have been performed in animal heart and brain. Former and progressed emulsification for intravascular use have been investigated for infarction and reperfusion injury. This investigations are reviewed and the potencies for the use of PFC in neurology, neurosurgery, diagnostics today and in the future are emphasized.
