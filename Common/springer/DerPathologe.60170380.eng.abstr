Occupational formaldehyde exposure in pathology depends on the efficiency of the ventilation system in use and may reach concentrations considerably above the current threshold limit values. The reduction of formaldehyde exposure by stepwise improvement of the ventilation system at a pathologist's workplace is presented as an example in this paper. Assessment of formaldehyde concentration by personal air sampling at a workplace originally equipped with a hood ventilation system resulted in values of up to 4 ml/m3 in the pathologist's breathing zone. Lowering the ventilation inlet to the working level by connecting the hood to a suction unit via a flexible hose resulted in an effective reduction of formaldehyde exposure to values of about 0.5 ml/m3. This simple and low-cost technical improvement had some uncomfortable side effects, such as current noise and wind chill, which could only be overcome by installing ventilated worktables according to modern technical standards.
