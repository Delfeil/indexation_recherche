The number of patients with congenital cyanotic heart disease who reach child-bearing age is increasing. This is partly a consquence of the high long-term survival and the haemodynamic benefits resulting from the Fontan procedure, which is used for the definitive palliation of such cyanotic heart disease as tricuspid atresia and single ventricle. However, so far little experience has been recorded with pregnant patients who have undergone right ventricular exclusion procedures. The particular physiology of a univentricular heart and a passive, non-pulsatile blood flow through the lungs has significant implications for the anaesthetic obstetric management of these patients. We report a case of successful pregnancy and caesarean delivery after a modified Fontan procedure.
