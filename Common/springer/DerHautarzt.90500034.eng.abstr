The treatment of choice for prevention of recurrent erysipelas is the long-term therapy with intramuscular penicillin. The results are often unsatisfactory. Usually erysipelas recurs when the treatment is stopped. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a new treatment regimen, consisting of intravenous penicillin combined with lymphatic drainage. Fifteen patients who had suffered from three or more episodes of erysipelas within the last two years received 10 Mega I.U. of penicillin per day over ten days every third month over a one year period (patients who were allergic to penicillin received erythromycin). Use of intravenous penicillin was combined with lymphatic drainage performed by a sequential pneumatic compressing device. The treatment results were assessed by clinical examination and laboratory tests as well as by laser Doppler imaging every third month. During the one year treatment period and a further year of follow-up, 14 of 15 patients had no recurrent erysipelas. Only a 65 year old patient suffering from Parkinson heart failure, chronic lymphedema and an extensive stasis ulcers had recurrent erysipelas. The present treatment regimen appears to be an effective therapy for prevention of recurrent erysipelas.
