 Esophagectomy for esophageal carcinoma is associated with significant morbidity. Long-term survival rates are usually poor. Common problems in the early postoperative period are pulmonary complications and leakage at the collar anastomosis causing local infection, sepsis and subsequent anastomotic strictures. There are only a few reports in the literature about benign ulcerations in the gastric tube after resection of the esophagus for carcinoma. We report a patient with a huge benign ulcer in the gastric tube penetrating into the right lung 9 years after esophagectomy for carcinoma. Several aspects of possible etiologic factors and different prophylactic approaches as well as therapeutic aspects are discussed.
