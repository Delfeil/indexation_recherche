Progesterone antagonists (antiprogestions) can completely or partially inhibit progesterone effects at the receptor level. Accordingly, two types of antiprogestins, type I (pure antagonists and type II (partial agonists) have been proposed. Compounds with absent or much reduced represent a special subgroup of type II antiprogestins. Their abortifacient activity is drastically reduced because of high partial progestagenic activity. Antiprogestins can modulate the function of progesterone receptors in a tissue-specific manner. Type II antiprogestins interact with co-repressors of transcription and can, therefore, exert inhibitory effects even in the presence of strong DNA binding of the PR-antiprogestin complex. On the other hand, type I antiprogestins prevent the binding of the PR-antiprogestin complex to DNA. The "pure" antiprogestins can be particularly useful for obstetrical indications such as cervical ripening and labor induction at term. Surprisingly pure antiprogestins induce high myometrial responsiveness to oxytocic stimuli but inhibit uterine PGF2 secretion. This may be the reason why a combination with prostaglandins for induction of labor is essential. "Pure" Type II antiprogestins and the mesoprogestins exhibit antiovulatory activities and inhibit endometrial proliferation in primates. Some compounds can even induce a complete atrophy of the endometrium in the presence of circulating estrogens. This effect, which mechanism remains unclear, is surprising. There are ongoing studies aimed to determine which antiprogestin type is particularly suitable for a bleeding-free estrogen replacement therapy or endometriosis treatment.
