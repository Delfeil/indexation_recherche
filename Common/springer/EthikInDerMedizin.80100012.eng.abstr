Abstract.  Definition of the problem: The Dutch policy regarding euthanasia has been causing amazement in other countries over and over again: Although euthanasia is illegal in the Netherlands, there are cases of euthanasia in which no criminal prosecution follows. The latter are regulated actively and in public by the Dutch authorities. In other countries certain cases of euthanasia are sometimes tolerated as well, however, there it is in most cases merely tacitly consented to. In contrast to these countries, in the Netherlands it is declared in advance under which conditions physicians do not need to fear criminal prosecution of their illegal actions. How can this peculiar Dutch policy be explained?
