The reduction and plate osteosynthesis of condylar fractures often require a wide extraoral approach with the risk of facial nerve palsy. The endoscopic technique is an alternative. Seven condylar fractures were operated on under endoscopic control. In three patients a newly developed device for endoscopically controlled plate application was clinically tested for osteosynthesis. In two cases fracture healing was achieved. In the third case the plate had to be removed early due to insufficient screw fixation. The new device and the application technique are described in detail. This technique may be helpful in further minimizing trauma surgery.
