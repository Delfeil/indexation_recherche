We present a 34-year-old woman with angioma serpiginosum on the medial aspect of the left thigh, extending to the groin and the lower abdomen, and on the volar aspect of the left forearm. In addition to the late onset, the distribution along the lines of Blaschko was a remarkable feature of this case. We therefore re-examined our recent cases of angioma serpiginosum. In 6 of 7 cases, the distribution indeed corresponded to the lines of Blaschko. Thus, we suggest adding angioma serpiginosum to the list of skin lesions that may follow the lines of Blaschko.
