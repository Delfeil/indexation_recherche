We report three new cases of the SAPHO syndrome. This acronyme consists of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis. Symptoms of this syndrome, which may not all be present, are pustulotic skin diseases (pustulosis palmoplantaris or severe acne) associated with osteoarticular lesions (mainly sternoclavicular hyperostosis, spondylarthropathies or chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis). The dermatological aspects of this syndrome are discussed in detail.
