Purpose: Pulsed holmium lasers are currently used to correct hyperopia by means of laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK). Series of µs laser pulses are applied with a high repetition rate to induce shrinkage of corneal collagen fibers. The pulsed energy application results in intrastromal temperature peaks of up to 200  °C. A continuously emitting laser diode can - as we demonstrated recently in an invivo study on minipigs - be used for LTK and may be of advantage because the temperature rise is more steady. The aim of this study was to examine the safety, amount, and stability of hyperopic correction of diode LTK on blind human eyes.
