Healthcare is undergoing fundamental changes. New diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, the Internet, information technology and a new generation of purchasers and providers will face a proactive consumer's culture. The key to success for those managing healthcare facilities is the ability to perceive future trends and integrate them into quality managment strategies. The aim of those strategies is to create quality management as a controlling and navigation tool in a "new economy-based" healthcare system in which speed and connectivity are the values that will be of decisive importance.
