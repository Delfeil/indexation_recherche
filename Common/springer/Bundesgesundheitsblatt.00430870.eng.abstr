With the new Protection against infection Act, the system of notifiable diseases in Germany will have a new basis. In the future, certain diseases will be reportable by physicians and laboratory confirmed results for certain pathogens will be reportable by laboratories.  The law clearly lays out which information has to be passed along with the report by the reporting physician or laboratory.  It also states which parts of this information can be transmitted further on by the local health departments. Particularly for reports of suspected diseases or for laboratory results, not all the information which the health department should transmit will be available with the first report.Thus, the local health departments have to conduct own investigations.  The local health departments have the task to join the report of a disease and a laboratory result concerning one person and transmit it as a single case. In order to facilitate this task of putting together all transmittable data, surveillance case definitions were developed and a defined data entry program will be provided. The data will be transmitted via the respective State authority to the Robert Koch-Institut.
