Objectives: The cardiotoxic properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in-vitro, as well as under in-vivio conditions. A further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a ventriculocisternal perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic variabels and their reversability by wash-out with mock-CSF.
