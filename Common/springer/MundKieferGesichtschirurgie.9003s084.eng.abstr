A total of 27 vascularized iliac crest segments and four vascularized scapula transplants were transferred to achieve masticatory rehabilitation in 31 patients suffering from extensive maxillary defects; 83 Brånemark implants and 16 IMZ implants were inserted 4- 8 months after the bone transplantation. The implants were uncovered 6-8 months after insertion. All patients were provided with a bar-fixed, removable prosthesis. At an average insertion period of 4.5 years, the implant loss rate was 18.8%. The effectiveness of a  combination of microsurgical bone transplantation and implantation in treating serious maxillary defects is thus demonstrated.
