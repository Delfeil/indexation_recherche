Vocal fold vibration patterns during phonation are presented with different digital imaging systems. With newly developed technical equipment color images up to 1000 digital images/s were obtained without light intensifying enhancement techniques via rigid and flexible endoscopy. With this color high-speed system, morphologic structures, such as small blood vessels, were visualized in high-resolution quality as a result of additional color information. In another system, zooming of endoscopic pictures via pixel interpolation algorithms provided full-monitor presentation of vocal fold vibratory patterns. This system allows PC-based synchronization with microphone and electroglottographic signals in a frame-by-frame technique. Although only processing gray scale images, analyses of dynamic changes in modes of vibration were faciliated by the higher frame rate recording of up to 2000 frames/s and, in addition, they display corresponding analog signals. Both methods provide clinically important information. Furthermore, we demonstrated irregular vocal fold vibration patterns in a healthy adult volunteer. In this experiment, the irregular vibratory modes were induced by voluntarily applying asymmetric vocal fold tension. The asymmetric vocal fold vibration pattern resulted in (functionally induced) roughness of the voice as predicted by computer models of asymmetric vocal fold vibration. Digital high-speed cinematography proved to be a highly promising technique in the analysis of dysphonia and provided physiological examples that could be compared with models of coupled nonlinear oscillators.
