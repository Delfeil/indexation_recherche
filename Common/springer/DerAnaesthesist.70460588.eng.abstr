To test the hypothesis that the efficacy of local anaesthetics to block nerve conduction is related the time of day (TOD) of drug application, we retrospectively analysed data from previous experiments on tachyphylaxis. During the course of these experiments, as a measure of drug efficacy we determined the minimal blocking concentration (cm) of bupivacaine in rabbit aortic nerves at several TODs. The special in situ preparation used permitted study of local anaesthetic pharmacodynamics without the influence of pharmacokinetics, making it possible to investigate the chronopharmacodynamics of these drugs by relating cms to the respective TODs of their measurement.
