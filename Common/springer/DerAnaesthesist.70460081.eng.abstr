Thermoregulation and its impairment by  anaesthesia and surgery has recently been brought back into focus by researchers and clinicians. All volatile and IV anaesthetics,  opioids, as well as spinal and epidural anaesthesia increase the inter-threshold range of thermoregulation from 0.2 ° C to 4 ° C between vasodilation and vasoconstriction. Thermoregulatory vasoconstriction and shivering occurs in anaesthetized patients at lower core temperatures than in awake  subjects. Following induction of general or spinal/epidural anaesthesia, core temperature decreases significantly due to internal  redistribution of body heat from the core thermal compartment to peripheral tissues. About 1 h after induction of general anaesthesia and initial redistribution hypothermia, a real reduction in body heat occurs as heat loss exceeds metabolic heat production. Heat loss is further increased due to low operating room temperatures, evaporation from open body cavities, and cold IV fluids. Peripheral thermoregulatory vasoconstriction is triggered by core temperatures between 33 ° C and 35 ° C, and is able to slow heat loss. However, body heat content continues to decrease even though core temperatures remain nearly constant. During spinal or epidural anaesthesia thermoregulation remains intact in the unblocked body  segments, leading to reduced real heat loss when compared to general anaesthesia.
