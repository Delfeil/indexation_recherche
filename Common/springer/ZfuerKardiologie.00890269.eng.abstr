 Recently intra-atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Low-energy intra-atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus rhtyhm f.ex. after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided. Additionally this new technique has led to the development of implantable atrial defibrillators for the treatment of selected patients suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation. Intra-atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method, but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far. Especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy.
