In dermatological practice, itch is the leading symptom of many skin diseases with a variety of psychophysiological aspects. However, a complete inventory for the qualitative evaluation of these central nervous factors is missing, whereas in pain research, the McGill Pain Questionnaire is well established for this purpose. Thus, therapeutic effects of antipruritic agents are only incompletely described by visual analog scales or parameters of skin physiology. Here, a questionnaire modified in analogy to the McGill pain questionnaire is presented, developed in cooperation between dermatologists and neurophysiologists.
