 The assessment center (AC), which played an important role in the recruitment of officers at the beginning of the century, nowadays is used in the business for the selection of managers. Also in the medical institutions the AC is of increasing significance, since the accentuation of economic aspects have led to a change in the qualities expected of a physician in chief. Usually the AC in the classic form is not applied; more often, hospitals take advantage of professional counselors who obviously use the basic elements of the AC. Physicians who are concerned are recommended to study the essence of the AC.
