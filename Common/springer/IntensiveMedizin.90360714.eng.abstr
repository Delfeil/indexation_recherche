 The opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome is a rare brain-lesion of paraneoplastic or paraviral origin. Generalized action-myoclonus and the opsoclonus, a distinct ocular dyskinesia consisting of quick, involuntary movements of the eyeballs are the hallmarks of the disease. We describe the clinical course of a 63 year old man from our institution. After non-specific prodromal symptoms, he developed the main clinical signs opsoclonus and myoclonus. The course was rapidly progressive up to respiratory failure. All therapeutic efforts were unsuccessful. Only autopsy uncovered the underlying disease, a small cell carcinoma of the lung. Using the clinical presentation as an example the diagnostic and therapeutic options of the opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome are discussed. To our knowledge this is the first report of a patient with this syndrome, who was treated with artificial respiration.
