 Conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass (LVM) are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of LVM. This study was performed to compare LVM measurement by one- (1D), two- (2D), and 3D echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients (pts) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
