In cases of anterior shoulder instability it is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability. The traumatic instability is characterized by three lesions which are caused at the time of the primary dislocation: (1) Bankart lesion, (2) Hill-Sachs lesion, and (3) overstretching of the capsule. The capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the Bankart lesion. The stronger the capsule the greater the external force has to be to surmount the resistance caused by the capsule. The greater the external force, the greater the shearing forces are on the glenoid rim and the greater the damage is to the glenoid rim. Damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule. The Bankart lesion can be classified into five types: (1) minimal or no Bankart lesion, (2) Broca-Hartmann lesion, (3) step-like, detached labrum lesion, (4) avulsion fracture, and (5) chisel fracture. According to the investigation of 100 shoulders with recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation, in 8% the Bankart lesion extended from 6 to 8 o'clock (left shoulder), in 34% from 6 to 9 o'clock, in 40% from 6 to 11 o'clock and in 15% from 6 to 12  o'clock or beyond these marks. Only in 3% was there no Bankart lesion. When stabilizing a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration: stability and function. A balance has to be found between the two criteria. Reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability; the overstreched capsule also has to be shortened or shifted. Two criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation: (1) The capsule has to be reattached firmly and watertight all over the anterior glenoid rim; and (2) the overstreched capsule has to be shifted or shortened. A comparison between 100 shoulders operated on arthroscopically and 110 operated on according to open Bankart repair has shown that good results concerning stability and function can be obtained with both techniques. The recurrence rate was slightly lower in the open group compared to the arthroscopic group. This study has also shown that excellent function increases the recurrence rate slightly independently of open or closed technique.
