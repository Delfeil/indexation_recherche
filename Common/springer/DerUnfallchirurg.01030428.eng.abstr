Supracondylar femoral fractures still present a challenge to the treating surgeon. The incidence of delayed and non-unions is reduced due to the minimally invasive plating techniques, but establishing a correct axis and good function is still a problem. During the last few years new implants have been developed to allow less difficult operative techniques in minimally invasive surgery. The Less Invasive Stabilization System (LISS) is a percutaneous plating system with monocortical self-drilling screws. The screws are inserted with an aiming guide and form a stable angle with the plate. The distal femoral nail allows placement of a spiral blade in the nail, thereby enhancing the interlocking stability.
