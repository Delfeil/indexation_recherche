Using the PTB simulator, which emits real signals from patients, we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard). For this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial pulsewave, cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of 20 patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator. The invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. The invasive system showed a cut-off frequency of 35 Hz; the damping constant was 0.21. With 49 record signals from patients we carried out 15 simulated measurements each. From a total of 49 bio-signals from patients the Dinamap 1846 was able to process 41 signals and the HP M-1008B 47 signals. The mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to -2.50 mmHg, 3.35 mmHg (P<0.05) and 1.51 mmHg with the Dinamap 1846 and to -8.5 mmHg (P<0.001), -5.15 mmHg (P<0.001) and -5.58 mmHg (P<0.001) for the HP M-1008B. The 95% confidence limit for the systolic, diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to 56 mmHg, 30 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the Dinamap 1846 and 50 mmHg, 38 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the HP M-1008B. The differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different artefact detection and elimination techniques. The results of the performance tests we achieved with the PTB simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations. The American Association for the Advanecement of Medical Instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of 5 +/- 8 mmHg. None of the examined instruments lay within these limits. Due to the systematic and stochastic errors, we think that the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard) do not achieve performance levels that are adequate for measuring critically ill patients.
