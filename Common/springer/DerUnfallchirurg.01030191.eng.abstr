Biomechanical investigations in eight specimen elbow joints to test articulated external fixation showed correct extension-flexion joint position between 0 and 120 °. The central axis through the radial and ulnar condyles varies less than 3 ° in total. X-ray kinematography showed correct articulation in all cases without subluxation. In six patients with persistent subluxation and complex fracture of the proximal ulna external fixation with an additional articulation was placed. All patients began with physiotherapy on the 3rd day after operation, the range of joint motion was 0-30-95 ° in all cases, after 6 weeks 0-30-110 °. Additional articulated external fixation at the elbow joint can be an alternative treatment to long-term transfixation of the elbow in cases of complex injury.
