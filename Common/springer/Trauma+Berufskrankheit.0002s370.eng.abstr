Torsion fractures of the knee are frequently followed by injuries of the internal structures of the knee joint. The attendant physician is required to follow a course of investigation that combines a secure diagnosis with what is economically viable. The most important elements of this are the case history and the clinical examination, which, together with plain radiographs (knee a-p and lateral views, patella tangential view), often allows a clear clinical diagnosis and planning of further therapy. If the clinical diagnosis is not clear, in MRI investigation we now have a method available that allows highly accurate recognition of menisceal ruptures and lesions of the cruciate ligament lesions and of cartilage. It can make a decisive contribution to reducing the number of purely diagnostic arthroscopies performed and thus to cost reduction. The procedure followed for spiral injury to the knee joint is a classic illustration of how diagnostic algorithms can make a contribution to the quality of treatment outcome while economic aspects are taken account of at the same time.
