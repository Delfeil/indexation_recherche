 The correlation between angiography and vascular resistance measured during surgery is still controversial. Peripheral resistance in 40 infra-inguinal reconstructions was measured using a new method which integrates pressure and flow measurement into a temporary bypass system. Data are therefore collected under maximal physiological conditions using the patients' own blood and pulsatile blood flow. The angiographies were scored according to the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards, Society for Vascular Surgery, International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS/ISCVS). To estimate the association between angiography and resistance both simple cor-relation and multiple regression analyses were computed. The overall correlation coefficient was rs = 0.34 (P<0.05). Multiple regression analysis only revealed a prospective model for the popliteal artery. The results indicated that there is a poor correlation between angiography and peripheral resistance.
