The use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human integument is discussed with reference to the literature. The epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural, functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers. The actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed. Practical difficulties are emphasized: in particular, the conditions required for use of porcine skin in experimental research, the most suitable breeds, and restrictions on biological interpretation of the results.
