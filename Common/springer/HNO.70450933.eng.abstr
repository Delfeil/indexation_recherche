Benign esophageal strictures in the upper esophagus may be caused by systemic diseases. A rare reason for esophageal strictures are the mechanobullous disorders marked by blister formation following relatively minor trauma, e.g. epidermolysis bullosa. In this report we present a 63-year-old patient who had suffered from epidermolysis bullosa simplex since birth. The epicutaneous symptoms were no longer present but an esophageal stricture had developed. The stricture was treated by X-ray-controlled ballon dilation twice, with a functionally good result. We suggest managing a recurrence recidiv of stricture with balloon dilation to minimize trauma and prevent further lesions.
