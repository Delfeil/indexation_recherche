Extra-articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint (genu varum or valgum) are treatments proven over many years. The middle and long term results shows many patients are very satisfied. Unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores. The good results by infra- and supracondylar osteotomies - some of them for 15 years and more - have to be achieved by prosthesis first. The important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning, the miss load, and the instability of the joint; these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency. Therefore, indication of infra- or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient. The most important fact is the condition of the joint, especially the quality of bone, the instability of the joint, and the loss of bone. Given the right indication, the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint. Also, there are still chances to do another operation, such a prothesis. A prothesis can be implanted if the osteotomy has no chance to preserve the joint.
