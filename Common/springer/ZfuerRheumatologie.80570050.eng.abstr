 Ochronosis is a rare disorder of tyrosin catabolism with an autosomal, recessive trait. Clinical signs predominantly affect the locomotor system. Inflammatory episodes in large joints can mimick Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Brownish discoloration of sclerae and cartilage is characteristic, diagnosis is confirmed by typical changes of spinal X-rays and the finding of homogentisic acid in urine samples. We describe a case of a 53 year old female patient with ochronosis and a second diagnosis of RA.
