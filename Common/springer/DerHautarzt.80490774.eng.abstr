High dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have been shown to be effective in different autoimmune diseases. We report on the use of IVIG in patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or pemphigus foliaceus (PF) resistent to conventional therapy. Six patients who presented with a relapse of their disease following conventional immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine were additionally treated with 2 g/kg of IVIG every four weeks. Six to nine cycles of this therapy were given to each patient. All patients showed healing of their blisters without evidence of relapse even when steroids and immunosuppressants were tapered. None of the patients relapsed  within one year of follow-up, although IVIG treatment was discontinued. Side effects of IVIG treatment were moderate with only slight evidence of headaches. We suggest that adjuvant treatment of PV and PF resistant to conventional immunosuppressive strategies is a useful addition to our therapeutic arsenal in both diseases.
