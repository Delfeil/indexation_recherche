 Angioplasty and stenting for the treatment of internal carotid artery lesions have hitherto only been carried out with reluctance. However, the number of reports is increasing. Pilot studies have confirmed the technical feasibility of the procedure and shown amazingly low complication rates in some cases. Preliminary communications on a few controlled studies have reported a higher rate of cerebral complication but the results are still regarded as encouraging. An upward learning curve, which should be associated with declining complication rates, and the avoidance of surgery are the desired goals. Some authors already conclude that any carotid lesion can be dilated and regarded angioplasty as an acceptable or even a better alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Although phase I studies have not yet been completed, angioplasty is increasingly being recommended and performed. Randomized studies have been proposed but for the most part rejected on the grounds that there is insufficient information on angioplasty, that angioplasty itself must be regarded as a "blind" procedure leaving embolic complications to chance, that the complication rate is too high compared with the gold standard endarterectomy and that the procedure has not yet progressed beyond the experimental stage. However, the results already obtained in prospective studies so far are suf-ficient. As a less invasive and faster procedure, claimed - but not yet proved - to have a lower complication rate, angioplasty and/or stenting of the internal carotid artery are already being increasingly performed and this trend will continue in the future. Only randomized studies with the active participation of vascular surgeons treating comparable patient groups will provide answers to the still unresolved questions. Randomized (multicenter) studies are necessary and should therefore be performed.
