A 63-year-old man is presented in whom a tenosynovial giant-cell  tumor destroyed the right temporomandibular joint and fossa and showed extensive intracranial growth. Because of uncharacteristic complaints, a symptomatic treatment was performed elsewhere. The lesion was finally resected under endotracheal anesthesia. After 20 months free of recurrence the patient's outcome is very satisfying. Differential diagnosis and therapy are discussed.
