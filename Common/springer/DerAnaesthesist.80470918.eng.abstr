Propofol is known to possess direct antiemetic effects. Its use for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia has been shown to be associated with a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) when compared to any other anaesthetic drug or technique. However, its mechanism of action in this context is still not well understood. In this article, the best ways to take advantage of propofol's antiemetic properties are emphasized. The possible effects of propofol on the cerebral cortex, its interactions with the dopaminergic and the serotoninergic systems are evaluated by the known clinical and basic science results. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of using propofol to decrease the incidence of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
