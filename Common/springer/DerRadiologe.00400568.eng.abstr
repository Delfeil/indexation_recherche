In this retrospective study the results of surgical biopsy of suspected breast cancer in 319 outpatients are reported. In 113 cases (35.4%) the lesion was palpable, in 206 cases (64.6%) it was not. Concerning the nonpalpable lesions, mammography was per- formed in 98 patients (47.6%) for work-up of fibrocystic changes, in 41 patients (19.9%) for initial participation in a breast cancer prevention program, and in 33 patients (16.0%) for surveillance after breast conservation therapy. Prior to operation, 84.0% (n=173) of the nonpalpable lesions were detected by mammography, 11.2% (n=23) by sonography, and 4.8% (n=10) by magnetic resonance imaging. Intra-operative specimen mammography was carried out in every case detected by mammography. In 19.4% (n=40) of 206 nonpalpable lesions a malignant tumor was found. Twenty-five percent (n=10) of all marked tumors were diagnosed and treated as in-situ stage tumors, while 65% (n=26) were diagnosed and treated as tumors in the pT1 stage. As regards the nodal stage, 85% (n=34) of the tumors were diagnosed and treated as pNO tumors, and 100% (n=40) were found to be free from any distant metastases. Consequently, for improving prognosis and, at the same time, for reducing the rate of breast amputations as a means of curative therapy of breast cancer, regular screening in defined risk groups is necessary. Surgical treatment of patients with small and nonpalpable findings should be reserved for departments with marking and quick-freezing facilities.
