According to sonographic criteria, 55 patients underwent surgical treatment with mobilisation in a lower leg plaster or conservative treatment with early mobilisation in heel pad (3 cm) shoes when an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) was diagnosed. The follow-up period in 51 patients was 2.4 years (operated group = 28 patients, conservative group = 23 patients) with clinical examination and testing of isokinetic muscle strength in knee joint flexion. After surgical treatment, minor wound infections occurred in 10.6 %. Reruptures occurred in 13 % of the conservative group. Following conservative treatment, the rate of stress-related achillodynia was significantly higher (P = 0.019). In the operated group mean isokinetic muscle strength was 13.7 % lower than in the uninvolved leg and decreased significantly with non-operative treatment to 75.3 % (P = 0.012). We recommend surgical treatment of acute ATR. The indications for conservative treatment depend on the extent of the rupture (measured by ultrasound in the equinus position), the desired level of daily activity and the patient's degree of compliance.
