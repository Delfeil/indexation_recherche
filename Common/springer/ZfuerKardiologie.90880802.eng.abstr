 Assessment of the myocardial contractility in terms of the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening appropriate to the actual left ventricular endsystolic wall stress requires endsystolic pressure measurement usually done invasively. But for noninvasive evaluation of this parameter, we elaborated an algorithm to derive the endsystolic pressure in the ascending aorta from oscillometric blood pressure measurements.
