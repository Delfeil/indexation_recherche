The unwanted side effects of muscle relaxants used for anaesthesia in the newborn and infants resulted in a search for alternatives to atraumatic intubation (IN). The study was aimed to investigate conditions of intubation, time of intubation as well as changes in systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure (RRs/RRm/RRd) and heart rate (HR) under the use of propofol (P) after narcosis induction by mask.
