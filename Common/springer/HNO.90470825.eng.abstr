A case is reported of a 57-year-old man who was found to have a right vocal cord paralysis that most likely followed prolonged treatment with the anti-arrythmic medication Amiodaron-HCl (Cordarex). Phoniatric treatment was given for 5 1/2 months, during which time microlaryngoscopy and stroboscopy were performed. With the help of speech therapy, mobility of the paralyzed cord was seen to begin to return 3 1/2 months after discontinuing the Amiodaron-HCl. Full cord mobility has not returned to date.
