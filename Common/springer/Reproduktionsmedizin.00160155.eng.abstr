Urogenital infections are established as hazards to male fertility. Various pathophysiological hypotheses have evolved from experimental and clinical studies, facilitating explanation of the effects of bacteria and immunological events on reproductive tissues. Numerous current studies have identified and evaluated infectious mediators accounting for specific molecular events in urogenital infections. Valuable studies can be expected to appear in the future due to improvements in diagnostic procedures and new classifications of urogenital infections.
