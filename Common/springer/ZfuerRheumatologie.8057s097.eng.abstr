 Fibromyalgia patients hardly suffer from major psychiatric illnesses. Most often, persistent somatoform pain disorder (ICD-10) and dysthymia are identified by psychiatric assessment. Features of "pain proneness" can also be found regularly, which can explain the elevated levels of stress observed in FMS. Repeated traumatic experiences during childhood and as adults can be discovered in many cases, which helps to understand some of the difficulties met in psychotherapy with FMS patients. Modified psychotherapy techniques are recommended using pain-centered behavioral methods initially, and progressing only later to an insight orientated approach.
