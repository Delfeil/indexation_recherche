Digital ischmia with gangrene of one or several fingertips has been described as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with various malignant tumors, especially adenocarcinomas. Most often this paraneoplastic syndrome represents the first symptom of an occult neoplasia in an advanced stage. We present the case of an 83 year-old patient with digital ischemia and gangrenous fingertips in association with a latent adenocarcinoma of the uterus and metastatic involvement of the paraaortal lymph nodes. Acute occurrence of digital ischemia and gangrene without pathological laboratory findings and negative past medical history concerning cardiovascular-induced emboli, arteriosclerotic occlusion, or rheumatologic and autoimmune diseases should suggest this paraneoplastic syndrome and lead to thorough search for an underlying tumor.
