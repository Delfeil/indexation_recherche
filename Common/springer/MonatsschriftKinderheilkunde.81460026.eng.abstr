Gastrointestinal mucormycosis is rare and occurs predominantly in the immunocompromised patient. Earlier case reports on affected preterms described a perforation of the stomach or of the bowel or the patients had signs of necrotizing enterocolitis. We report on a premature infant of 24 weeks of gestation with a bowel perforation. A mucormycosis of the intestine was proven by culture and by histological examination. There was no pneumatosis intestinalis, the bowel perforation happened very early and the small bowel showed a reduced perfusion. These points could allow a differentiation from a typical necrotizing enterocolitis. This is of importance, since a very early diagnosis and a rapid beginning of treatment (surgical extirpation, Amphotericin B) may improve the bad prognosis of a mucormycosis.
