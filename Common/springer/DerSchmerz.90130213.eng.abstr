In paediatric oncology, optimal pain control is still a challenge. A structured pain history and the regular scoring of pain intensity using age-adapted measuring tools are hallmarks of optimal pain control. Psychological measures are as important as drug therapy in prophylaxis or control of pain, especially when performing invasive procedures. Pain control is oriented on the WHO analgesic ladder. On no account the paediatric patient should have to climb up the 'analgesic ladder' - strong pain requires the primary use of strong drugs. Opioids should be given by the oral route and by the clock - short acting opioids should be used to treat break-through pain. Alternatives are IV infusion and patient-controlled analgesia. Constipation is the adverse effect most often seen with (oral) opioid therapy. Adverse effects should be anticipated, and prophylactic treatment should be given consistently. The assistance of paediatric nurses is of utmost importance in paediatric pain control. Nurses deliver the basis for rational and effective pain control by scoring pain intensity and documenting drug administration as well as adverse effects. The nurses' task is also to prepare the patient for and monitor the patient during painful procedures. It is the responsibility of both nurse and doctor to guarantee emergency intervention during sedation whenever needed. In our paper we comment on drug selection and dosage, pain measurement tools, and documentation tools for the purpose of pain control. Those tools may be easily integrated into daily routine.
