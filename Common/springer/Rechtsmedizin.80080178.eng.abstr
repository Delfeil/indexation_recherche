 All 459 surgeons and orthopedists in private practice in Berlin (approx. 3.5 Million inhabitants) were contacted in March 1997 and asked to cooperate. An 18-point questionnaire was sent out to record the physician's experience with atraumatic and posttraumatic neck complaints, which was returned by only 112 (25%). According to their assessment these physicians treated ca. 47 000 atraumatic patients with cervical complaints and ca. 7800 with a history of a preceeding trauma over a 12-month-period (1996). All responders had treated patients with posttraumatic complaints; about 60% stated having treated between 20 and 60 patients per year, 25% a smaller and 15% a greater number of patients. The average treatment time was stated to be 2-5 weeks by 60% of the physicians, 10% listed a peak of 6-7 weeks and another 10% in excess of this peak. Half of the physicians stated having also treated patients with a cervical trauma not caused by another person (a total of 500 cases). Symptoms/findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca. 50% of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half. It is noteworthy that the physician's point of view was influenced by personal accident experience (accident as a car passenger): 54% of the 26 physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be traumaspecific compared to only 35% of 40 physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms. The statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22% of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62% of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement. Of the physicians 32% were already familiar with personal cervical complaints in middle age unrelated to trauma and another 18% considered them sometimes a disease parameter. The "subject physician" in the context of "whiplash injury" is not yet sufficiently investigated but seems to be an interesting topic of further research.
