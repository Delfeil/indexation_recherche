In vitro fertilisation IVF and intrazytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction. Whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted, for example severe tubal damage which cannot be microsurgically repaired, cryptozoospermia, severe OAT syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal IVF, ICSI might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well. In this paper a number of additional ICSI indications are defined, for example minor forms of andrological subfertility, reinsemination of nonfertilised oocytes on the day after conventional IVF, reduced motility of cryopreserved sperms, reduced quality of oocytes or ICSI after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in IVF.
