 Intravenous thrombolysis has become a standard in treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Efficacy of thrombolysis is strictly time dependent. It has been shown in several studies that the most benefit in terms of myocardial salvage and short- and long-term mortality is achieved with initiation of therapy within the first 60-90 minutes after onset of symptoms. Nearly exlusively, prehospital initiation of thrombolysis makes it possible to take advantage of this early time window. Moreover, randomized studies yielded a better outcome when a time gain of >=90 minutes was achieved. Since it has been shown that prehospital diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction is reliable and out-of-hospital initiation of therapy has no additional specific risk, patients seen within the first 60-90 minutes after onset of symptoms or for whom a relevant time gain >=90 minutes can be expected are ideal candidates for, and therefore should receive, prehospital thrombolysis. In places where acute intervention (e.g., PTCA) is available, protocols should be developed which take the specific time windows into consideration.
