 Even though many decision-aids have been developed in the past, the application of these systems in clinical practice is still rare. There are many reasons for this, including the reservations of potential users. A survey in three university surgery clinics was conducted to assess the experience and attitudes towards decision-aids among physicians. Seventy-two of the 102 physicians approached (71 %) filled out and returned the short questionnaire that was sent to them. More than half of the 72 survey participants already use decision-aids. Among them, guidelines are used most often (46 %), whereas other instruments (algorithms, scores, decision trees) are used less frequently (10-17 %). Computer-based decision-aids are hardly used at all (7 %). These results are in contrast to the strong request for more decision-aids, especially for computer-based systems (40 %). Physicians who already use decision-aids are more interested in additional systems. More than 70 % of all participants are interested in more information about the topic. The standardized question about attitudes towards computer-based decision-aids reveals more positive than negative appraisal, whereas the answers to open questions focus more on objections. The substantial differences between the three survey locations in parts of the survey results show that attitudes towards decision-aids are influenced by the way the instruments are introduced and the way the users are informed and involved in the process of implementation. A successful implementation of decision-aids in clinical practice should therefore try to integrate the future users as much as possible.
