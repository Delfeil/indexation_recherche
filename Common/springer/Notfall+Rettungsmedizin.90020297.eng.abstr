Simulation is a new technique in anaesthesiology. Full scale simulators are devices capable of modelling exactly important physiological aspects of a patient. These models, a patient mannequin and a realistic enviroment, evoke the impression of treating a real patient. Simulation serves the purposes of training and education, of research and development. It is an excellent tool for the acquisition of knowledge, experience and the training for emergency situations (crisis resource management). Research areas are human factors, ergonomy, physiology and modelling. The available devices still offer room for improvements. Currently there is an increasing number of about 90 installations worldwide and 5 in Germany. With great financial, organisational and personal efforts the centres offer classes for external participants and members of their own institutions. The eventual role of simulation in the training and education of anaesthesiologists and other medical personell still has to be defined.
