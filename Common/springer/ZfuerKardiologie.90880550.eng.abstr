 Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart muscle disease of unknown cause. It can cause both cardiac arrrhythmia and heart failure or sudden death. As such patients typically will present to one of three groups depending upon the symptoms at presentation: the pathologist, the physician or the arrhythmologist. Typically a young patient who presents with presyncope or syncope may be investigated by an electrophysiologist and have ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Sadly some young individuals with ARVC may present to a pathologist with sudden cardiac death. Those that survive repeated bouts off arrhythmia and/or some individuals with primary heart failure may initially present to general physicians/cardiologists.
