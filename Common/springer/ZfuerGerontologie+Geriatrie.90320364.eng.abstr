 We investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. 32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The patients were divided into two groups according to their age. The result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti-depressant effect of sleep deprivation.
