Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a disease with a wide spectrum of cutaneous and systemic manifestations. Discoid LE (DLE) is the most common form of cutaneous LE; the disseminated form of DLE is rare. We report an encouraging response to treatment with extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in a single patient with disseminated DLE who did not respond to conventional therapy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first successful use of ECP in the management of such a patient. Extracorporeal photopheresis is a therapeutic modality that has been under investigation for more than 12 years. Although originally developed for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, ECP has recently been used for the management of autoimmune diseases including systemic scleroderma, pemphigus vulgaris and SLE, as well as prevent organ rejection in patients with cardiac or kidney transplants and graft versus host disease after bone marrow transplantation.
