 Baker's cysts were treated operatively in 19 patients in the Department of Traumatology of the University of Cologne from 1988 to 1997. The subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography (follow-up: 95 %). All patients were examinated before surgery, sonography and X-ray of the knee were performed. We differentiated between the congenital primary cyst (39 %), and the secondary form, which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion (61 %). Arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of Baker's cyst. Postoperative complications were two reinterventions due to one hematoma and one effusion. Patient's evaluation of operation result was "excellent" in 61 % and "good" in 39 % of cases. All knee joints had a full range of motion. There was only one case of a recurrent cyst. The primary form of Baker's cyst has always to be extirpated, according to our clinical experience. The extirpation of the secondary Baker's cyst and the relevance of arthroscopy and treatment of the basic disease have to be discussed.
