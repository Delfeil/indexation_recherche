Various in vitro models have been introduced for comparative examinations of post-dural-puncture trauma and measurement of liquor leakage through puncture sites. These models allow simulation of subarachnoid, but not of peridural, pressure. A new two-chamber-model realizes the simulation of both subarachnoid and peridural pressure and allows observation of in vitro punctures with video-documentation. Frame grabbing and (computer-aided) image analysis show new aspects of spinal puncture effects. Therefore, post-dural-puncture trauma and retraction can be objectively visualized by this method, which has not previously been demonstrated.
