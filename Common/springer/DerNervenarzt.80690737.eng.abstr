Long-term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenias requires integration of many therapeutic approaches, co-operation of several professions, and regard for the views of patients and relatives. This review deals with practical aspects of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive resp. psychological treatments, social resp. milieu therapy, rehabilitation, interventions based on the concept of Expressed Emotions (EE), psychoeducation and work with relatives. Continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration. Indications for adding on antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed, as well as treatment of negative symptoms, depression and management of treatment-resistant symptoms. Psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient. In the context of a stable long-term relationship, the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action. Effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited. The best results are achieved by social skills training. Social therapy, which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient, is of paramount importance. Improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long-term social rehabilitation. Interventions based on the EE concept are highly effective, but are rarely used. Programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective. The functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained, the integrative role of case-management is stressed.
