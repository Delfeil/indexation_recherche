Parenteral nutrition required following surgery or injury should not only meet post-aggression caloric requirements but also match the specific metabolic needs so as not to worsen the metabolic disruptions already present in this situation. The primary objective of parenteral nutrition is body protein maintenance or restoration by reduction of protein catabolism or promotion of protein synthesis or both. Whether all parenteral energy donors, i.e., glucose, fructose, other polyols, and lipid emulsions, are equally capable of achieving this objective continues to be a controversial issue. The objective of the present study was to answer the following questions: (1) Do glucose and fructose differ in their effects on the metabolic changes seen following surgery or injury, the changes in glucose metabolism in particular? (2) Can the observation of poorer glucose utilization in the presence of lipids be confirmed in ICU patients?
