The presence of inflammatory infiltrates in unstable coronary plaques suggests that inflammatory processes may contribute to the pathogenesis of these syndromes. In patients with unstable angina, coronary atherosclerotic plaques are characterized by the presence of macrophages, and to a lesser extent, T-lymphocytes, at the immediate site of either plaque rupture or superficial erosion: moreover, the rupture-related inflammatory cells are activated, indicating ongoing inflammation at the site of plaque disruption. These observations are confirmed by clinical studies demonstrating activated circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes, and increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) 1 and 6, and of acute phase reactants in patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction. In particular elevated levels of C-reactive protein are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital and 1 to 2 years new coronary events in patients with unstable angina, but are also associated with an increased long-term risk of death and myocardial infarction in apparently normal subjects. Thus, accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation may cause local endothelial activation and, possibly, plaque fissure, leading to unstable angina and infarction. Although no information is yet available on the causes of inflammation and on its localization, these novel lines of research may open the way to a different approach to the patient with acute coronary syndromes.
