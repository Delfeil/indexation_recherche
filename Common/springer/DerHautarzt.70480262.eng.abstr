A 76 year old patient with actinic reticuloid was treated with Cyclosporin A. 11 months after beginning the immunosuppressive therapy, he developed lymphoedema and livid nodular skin lesions of the right leg, which histologically showed Kaposi's sarcoma. After stopping the Cyclosporin A and intralesional therapy with Interferon alpha, no regression of the Kaposi sarcoma could be seen. The characteristics of Kaposi sarcoma arising during immunosuppressive therapy and the differences in incidence, risk groups and distribution pattern compared to the classic sporadic and the AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma will be described. The development of Kaposi sarcoma during immunosuppressive therapy for actinic reticuloid has not been previously described.
