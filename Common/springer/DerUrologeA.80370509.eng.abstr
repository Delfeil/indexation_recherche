Vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction. In this category, penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients: males younger than 50 years of age at time of surgery, maximum of two risk factors, exclusion of diabetes mellitus. Long-term success decreased to 53 % to 55 % in comparison to first encouraging reports of 80 % success. Venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the elapse of time after surgery. Long-term success dropped under 40 %, leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation. In contrast, penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates. Despite this, it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the cavernosal bodies. Among numerous types of penile implants, preference is nowadays mostly given to the three-piece hydraulic models. However, such complications as defective or perforated cylinders in up to 35 % after 5 years have arisen, depending on the type of implant. In a selected patient group, vacuum constriction devices with a mean patient acceptance of 75 % (50 % to 90 %) seldom result in complications and are thus considered to be a well-established therapeutical option.
