Sonography of the shoulder joint is a well-established technique in the hands of the experienced examiner, when using a standardized protocol. It has proved invaluable in assessing pathological soft tissue changes, especially after trauma. The static evaluation of anatomy and dynamic assessment of function are especially helpful in both preoperative staging and postoperative follow-up. The normal anatomy, examination techniques, including our own variations, and pathological conditions are discussed. The findings and various classifications of impingement syndrome, rotator cuff injuries, biceps tendon lesions and inflammatory changes are examined. Review of the major articles in the literature shows excellent correlation with our results, the overall sensitivity in the case of rotator cuff lesions being over 90 %. A well-performed ultrasound examination in most cases obviates the need for the more invasive arthroscopy and the more cumbersome and expensive MRI examinations.
