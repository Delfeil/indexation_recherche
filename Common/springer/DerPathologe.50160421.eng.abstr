Uterine tumors resembling sex-cord ovarian structures are exceptionally rare. Clement and Scully divided them into two groups. The first group includes cases with less than 50 % and the second with more than 50 % sex-cord elements. Group one tumors show a higher incidence of recurrences. We report a case of a 54-year-old women with a partly retroperitoneal, cystic tumor 7  -  6  -  6 cm. Histologically, sex-cord differentiation of more than 50 % was seen with positive immunostaining against vimentin, desmin and focally against myoglobin and cytokeratines. The reaction against EMA, CEA and S 100 was negative. The patient was treated by abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oovorectomy. She shows no evidence of disease 2.3 years after the initial surgery. Based on the light microscopic features and immunohistochemical pattern, the tumor was interpreted as arising from the endometrial stromal cells or multipotential uterine mesenchyme that showed diverse differentiation toward ovarian sex-cord stroma and uterine smooth muscle with interspersed stromal cell clusters.
