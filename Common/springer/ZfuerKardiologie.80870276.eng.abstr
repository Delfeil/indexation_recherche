  The occurrence of paravalvular abscesses in the course of an acute endocarditis of the aortic valve indicates an advanced stadium of the disease. The infection has spread beyond the limits of the valve leaflets, and ongoing destruction of the paravalvular tissue is to be expected, if the endocarditis is continually treated by antibiotics alone. Surgery of acute endocarditis with paravalvular abscess, however, supposly carries an increased risk of early mortality and late morbidity. The following prospective study was carried out to determine whether a radical surgical approach together with aggressive postoperative antibiotic therapy could help to improve results.
