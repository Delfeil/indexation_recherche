 Several new approaches are available for early defibrillation. One example is semiautomatic defibrillators used by the first arriving emergency staff. The recommendations for introducing emergency medical technician (EMT) defibrillation in Germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor-manned-ambulances or the experiences of the German multi-center-study. This analysis intends to contribute data to an EMT defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous-system. Methods: In a prospective study a EMT-defibrillation group (= DG) was compared with a standard group (basic life support by EMTs and defibrillation by emergency physicians) (= SG) and a control group (emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with EMTs) (= CG). In the DG semiautomatic defibrillators from Laerdal (Heartstart 3000) were used. Successfully resuscitated patients were followed up with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the Pittsburgh Brain Stem Score (PBSS), and Pittsburgh Cerebral (CPC) and Overall Performance Categorie (OPC). Results: Over 13 months 43 patients were included, primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation (VF). Depending on the first arriving emergency staff the patients were allocated to the DG (n = 12), to the SG (n = 18) or to the CG (n = 13). DG and SG did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long-term prognosis (primary successful 8.3% vs. 38.9%, definite successful 0% vs. 27.8%). The primary survival rate in the DG was significantly lower than in the CG (8.3% vs. 61.5%). In the long term survival rate there were no significant differences. In the DG significantly less patients received bystander CPR (8.3%) than in the other groups (55.6% and 69.2%). Neither the variable "witnessed collapes" nor "bystander CPR" had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study. The average response time for the first arriving rescue team was 5.5 +/- 2.4 min, without a significant difference between the groups. Conclusions: A comparison of this study with American, European and German recommendations for EMT defibrillation programms revealed some deviations. Bystander CPR seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician. A benefit of EMT defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our "rendezvous-system", possibly because the time interval was less than 4 min (3.5 min). Since the result is in accordance with the German multi-center-study, a critical consideration of a EMT defibrillation program seems to be necessary in "Rendezvous-systems".
