For over 100 years many different methods have been used to determine capillary resistance as a measure of small vessel fragility. There is still no firm agreement as to the most suitable method; the procedure is not standardized and an objective system for measurement is lacking. We have developed a computerized system that makes it possible to count petechiae and determine their area without the results varying with different examiners. Although we tried to keep the conditions for our examinations constant, we found a wide individual spread. In spite of this, the capillary resistance of atopic subjects was significantly lower than that of healthy persons.
