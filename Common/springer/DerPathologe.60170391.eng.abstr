We report two cases of patients (one 65 and one 43 years of age, respectively) who died of Streptococcus-viridans induced endocarditis of the aortic valve with perforation into the right atrium. Whereas perforation in Staphylococcus-induced endocarditis is a common complication, it occurs rarely in Streptococcus-induced endocarditis. Because of its uncharacteristic symptoms, the endocarditis was clinically unknwon in both cases and was recognized to be the cause of death only at autopsy. To reduce the large number of complications in patients suffering from endocarditis, it is necessary to confirm the diagnosis as soon as possible if endocarditis might be suspected.
