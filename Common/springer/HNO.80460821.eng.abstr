Basal cell adenocarcinoma is a rare entity that was first defined as a malignant salivary gland tumor in 1991. We present another case report and discuss pathology, pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, therapy and prognosis on the basis of currently available literature. Although histomorphologic features of the tumors are similar to basal cell adenomas, proof of an infiltrative and destructive growth is essential for diagnosis. Adenoid cystic carcinoma and basaloid squamous carcinoma must also be considered in any differential diagnosis. Tumor development within a pre-existing basal cell adenoma and de novo development are discussed.
