Sixty-six feet operated on for hallux valgus in 1984 were reviewed. Keller-Brandes' operation was performed in all cases, together with Lelièvre's "fibrous cerclage" and flexor hallucis longus tendon anchoring to the sesamoid pad, as described by A. Viladot. In most cases, satisfactory clinical correction was achieved and the patients could wear standard shoes. More than half of the cases presented partial limitation of movement at the first metatarsophalangeal joint; however, flexion power of the big toe was preserved, and the range of motion was wide enough to allow a painless and limpless gait. Radiologically, good correction of the angle between the first and second metatarsals and the metatarsophalangeal angle was obtained, but all cases presented proximal displacement of sesamoid bones. A baropodometric study showed that the toe-off phase of the gait does not change after this operation. In our series, central metatarsalgia was present in 17 feet; however, it did not compromise the functional result and was easily relieved with orthopaedic devices. Four feet showed radiographic images, suggesting necrosis of the first metatarsal head; all four were asymptomatic. The only case that required reoperation was the one that developed hallux varus deformity. The Keller-Brandes-Lelièvre-Viladot procedure is still a simple and effective method for the surgical treatment of hallux valgus in elderly people with osteoarthritis at the first metatarsophalangeal joint.
