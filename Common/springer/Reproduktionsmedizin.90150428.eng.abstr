There is hardly any other discipline that illustrates the conflict between the freedom of science and research, that is to say, ultimately, what is medically possible, and human dignity and the protection of life or, in other words, what can be justified in ethical or legal terms, so clearly as reproduction medicine. The topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum, ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective feticide, the many questions raised by assisted fertilization, and especially by anonymous sperm donation, and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation, to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis, some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts. In a good many of these sectors it is difficult to reconcile what doctors can do and what it is admissible for them to do, so that it is hardly surprising that there is often no general consensus. Against this backdrop objective discussion is all the more important, and the notes in this paper, which necessarily touch on only some of the matters at issue, are intended to stimulate such discussion.
