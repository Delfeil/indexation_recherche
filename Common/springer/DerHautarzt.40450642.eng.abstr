Abstract.  The case of a 48-year-old patient with systemic lupus erythematosus is discussed. Under immunosuppressive therapy, symptomless papules occurred on the shoulders, back, chest and face. Histologically, there were deposits of mucinous matter which produced an intensive blue colour in the HALE-PAS and alcian blue colour test. The epidermal and inflammatory dermal changes which typically occur with lupus erythematosus were absent. Whereas mucin is commonly diagnosed in lupus erythematosus, the clinical manifestation of papulous mucinosis is a rare but diagnostically significant phenomenon, since it can occur without further findings which are typical of lupus erythematosus.
