The mid-term results of this prospective randomized study illustrate why it is difficult to define a clear position concerning the issue of patellar resurfacing in total knee arthroplasty. In both groups of 20 patients typical complications for the respective procedures have occured. One patient from group A with patellar resurfacing had to be revised for loosening of the patellar implant. In group B without resurfacing 3 patellae subluxated, 2 having been revised. Furthermore 4 patients complained about mild to moderate anterior knee pain. The Knee and Function Scores of the patients without revision were not significantly different except for the parameter pain (Knee Score Gr. A:84.8, Gr. B:77.8; pain Gr. A:46.9, Gr. B:41.9; Function Score Gr. A:78.5, Gr. B:71.9; climbing stairs Gr. A:38.5, Gr. B:33.8). The radiological measurements found the patellae with resurfacing significantly less tilted with 3.8  ° than the patellae without resurfacing with 6.4  °. With the correct implantation technique patellar resurfacing guarantees a good clinical result within the first 5 years. Leaving the patella unresurfaced was associated with a higher rate of anterior knee pain and revison in our study.
