With the introduction of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines. We report two cases with high-dose usage and dependency of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. Both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occuring during a depressive episode. While one patient had a polysubstance abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient. To reduce withdrawal symptoms long-acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients. Thus, it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. Considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.
