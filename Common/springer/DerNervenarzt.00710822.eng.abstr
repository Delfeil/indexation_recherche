A severe course of alcohol withdrawal has been observed in 28% of patients in a neurological intensive care unit due to complicating central nerve system (CNS) diseases. In any atypical alcoholic delirium, especially with focal neurological signs, partial seizures, or decreased level of consciousness, CNS diseases like meningoencephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, or central pontine myelinolysis must be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tap. The diagnostic and prognostic value of CT scan and CSF analysis was examined in 32 persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens. Neurological complications and cerebral convulsions at the beginning of delirium tremens appear to predispose the patient to a protracted clinical course and necessary mechanical ventilation. Blood-CSF barrier permeability is increased in 70% of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course. Cerebral atrophy as shown in CT scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course. In our experience, CT examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium.
