  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disorder which primarily affected the myocardium. It is characterized by a hypertrophic left ventricle that shows normal systolic function but impaired diastolic relaxation. The most important complication of HCM, sudden cardiac death, is mainly responsible for a mortality of approximately 3.5% in childhood. While most patients remain asymptomatic for years, there are some reports about patients progressing from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to a dilative form within years.
