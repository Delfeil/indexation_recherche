 Solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura (SFTP) are very rare neoplasms. The majority of these tumors are benign, but about 10-20 % fulfill the criteria of malignancy. The clinical presentation varies according to the size and intrathoracic localization. In early stages, often asymptomatic, the tumors may grow to an enormous size and then cause symptoms such as cough, chest pain and dyspnea, but also paraneoplastic syndromes such as hypoglycemia or digital clubbing. Between 1981 and June 1998 we treated in our institution 16 SFTP in 14 patients (4 M, 10 F, average age at first operation 58 years). Eight patients showed symptoms, whereas in the other cases the tumors were found on routine chest X-rays. The usually pedunculated SFTP were completely resected without complications. Two patients developed malignant recurrences, which infiltrated the right upper lung lobe and the diaphragm respectively. In these cases the tumor was resected together with the adjacent structures. Since late recurrences are more often malignant than primary SFTPs long-term follow-up is mandatory even in benign lesions.
