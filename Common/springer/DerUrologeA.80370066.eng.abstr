Intraoperativ pulmonary embolism with acute cardiac arrest can successfully be managed by immediate open cardiac massage followed by rt-PA injection, an interdisciplinary approach is mandatory. The scheduled tumor nephrectomy was performed 6 weeks after the initial event. The tumor was embolised with intravascular coils placed in a supraselective manner by the radiologist. During the secondary procedure it was found to be necrotic. In the second case the event occurred at the end of a radical cystectomy. Instead of an ileal conduit cutaneous ureterostomies were used for urinary drainage after cardiac output had been restored and rt-PA had been administered.
