The well-documented positive effect of compression stocking therapy on the venous macro- and microhemodynamics of the legs can only be attained if the stockings fit well. In order to determine the effective pressure exerted by compression stockings, we usually deleted in US journals. One can get this out of journal and author's address have developed a new measuring method based on piezoresistant microprobes and a microprocessor unit. With our 2-mm-thick, 5-mm diameter probe, the pressure between the compression stocking and skin can be measured at any location desired. A temporal resolution of 50 Hz makes it possible to carry out dynamic measurements while the patient is walking or performing exercises on tiptoes. Here we present 4 typical cases out of a total of over 80 which we have evaluated. We have decided empirically that the pressure exerted by a class-2 compression stocking on the skin at the height of the ankles (b-position) should not exceed 70 mm Hg while resting and a peak of 110 mm Hg while exercising on tiptoes. At the middle of the calf (c-position) these values should not exceed 60 mm Hg at rest and 80 mm Hg on tiptoes. The pressure should decrease from the distal to proximal direction in order to produce a drainage gradient. We have found empirically that a pressure gradient of 30-40% from the b to the c measurement is favorable. Too high a proximal pressure or too high a pressure on a part of the lower leg causes pain and swelling. Too low a pressure, on the other hand, does not produce the desired vascular effect and alleviation of symptoms. Although dynamic pressure measurements take about 20-30 minutes per leg, they markedly improve patient compliance with compression therapy.
