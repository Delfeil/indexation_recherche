Teleradiology is a means of electronically transmitting radiographic patient images and consultative text.This offers a new way to communicate with other radiologists and transferring clinicans. Different applications of teleradiology, such as on-call services for emergency departments or rural regions, as well as expert consultation (second opinion) already have been realised. Especially in concern of dental radiography, analog (film-based) imaging gets progressively replaced by digital imaging. The combination with ultrafast data transfer offers an increasing efficacy in diagnosis and therapy, accelleration of communication and new means of quality assement in patient care. Various applications of teleradiology concerning dental medicine are discussed.
