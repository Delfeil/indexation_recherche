 Background: Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis is reported to be rare. Most commonly, treatment consists of conventional anticoagulation, often combined with caval interruption. Venous thrombectomy for IVC thrombosis has rarely been performed. Material and methods: Seventy patients (35 male, 35 female, mean age 36  +/-  17.2 years, range 11-73 years) with IVC thrombosis (unilateral iliofemoral + caval thrombosis 36, bilateral iliac thrombosis 30, others 4) underwent transperitoneal caval thrombectomy and/or transfemoral venous thrombectomy in a 15-year period (1980-1994). The suspected underlying cause of the DVT could be identified in 78.6%. Three patients suffered from septic DVT, 1 from ischemic thrombosis. A previous, less successful treatment had been performed elsewhere in 25.7% of cases. Thirty-two patients (45.7%) were admitted with pulmonary embolism. Early results: In 64 patients transfemoral venous thrombectomy with AV fistula was performed, with an additional transabdominal approach in 41 patients. Six patients underwent caval thrombectomy alone. Three patients (4.3%) died perioperatively. Intraoperative pulmonary embolization (PE) occurred in 3 patients (4.3%), in one of whom it was fatal. Early unilateral rethrombosis developed in 16 patients (22.8%); 12 were rethrombectomized, 9 successfully. Postoperative caval patency could be established in 87.1% of cases. Late results: Fifty-eight patients (82.9%) were followed up (mean follow-up time 44  +/-  35 months, range 3-120 months). Three patients died during follow-up. Of 47 patients (69 extremities, time to operation >1 year)17.4% had no PTS, 40.6% a mild, 30.4% a moderate and 11.6% a severe PTS (7.2% with stasis ulcer). Conclusion: IVC thrombosis is a rare but, due to the high risk of PE, a life-threatening disease. Transabdominal and/or transfemoral venous thrombectomy (with AV fistula) is a safe, reliable and occasionally life-saving treatment. Patency of the IVC can be established in most cases. Intraoperative embolization is rare. Follow-up results are satisfactory, long-term caval patency is good, peripheral postphlebitic sequela are frequent.
