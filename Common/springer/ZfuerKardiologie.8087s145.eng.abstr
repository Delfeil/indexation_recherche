  Antithrombotic therapy is a basic part in the treatment of acute as well as chronic coronary syndromes. The rationale is an enhanced platelet activity with predomination of procoagulatory mechanisms in coronary artery disease. The current status of antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulation, and chronic thrombolysis used in the treatment of chronic coronary syndromes is discussed. It is concluded that low-dose aspirin is the current drug of choice for long term oral treatment in patients with stable chronic coronary artery disease. In contrast, oral anticoagulation with coumadin should be considered in patients with higher risk for atrial or ventricular thrombosis. The impact of long-term intermittent urokinase therapy in patients with end-stage coronary artery disease and refractory angina pectoris leads to a marked improvement of clinical symptoms. Oral blockade of platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor and clinical trials regarding antiischemic effects of low-molecular weight heparins in chronic coronary syndromes are expected for the future.
