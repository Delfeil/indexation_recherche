The paper reminds of the many psychiatrists, neurologists, and pathologists connected with scientific work in neuropathology who were expelled from Germany between 1933 and 1939 because of defamation by the Nuremberg Laws or because of their political opposition. Many of these colleagues saw their only way out as suicide. Short biographies give an orientation about the destiny of the expelled physicians in their host countries. The effort made after 1945 to give these emigrated colleagues again an adaequate position in Germany have not been very intensive.
