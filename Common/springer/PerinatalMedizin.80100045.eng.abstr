Using data from the Magdeburg Register of Birth Defects, the baseline prevalence of indicator malformations is demonstrated. The prevalence of neural tube defects, congenital cardiac malformations, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, Down syndrome and omphaloceles is described as a time-dependent frequency in order to establish a possible relationship to the Chernobyl disaster. Moreover, the registration of birth defects makes it possible to analyze organ involvement and malformation-related infant mortality and to improve prenatal diagnosis.
