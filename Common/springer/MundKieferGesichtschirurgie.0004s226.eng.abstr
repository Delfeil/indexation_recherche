Distraction osteogenesis is established worldwide as a new surgical technique. The former rule, not to osteotomise before the end of bone growth, is no longer valid. Today, distraction starts as early as infancy as well as in childhood and adolescence. This new method allows the gain of bone in the distraction gap so that bone grafting can be avoided. Distraction is indicated in hemifacial microsomias, multiple syndromes with mandibular malformations, mandibular retrognathia, posttraumatic jaw deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, alveolar ridge resorptions, and alveolar ridge resections. Distraction surgery started in the mandible and was continued in the maxilla and the craniofacial region. Alveolar ridge distraction followed. After using extraoral devices, the development of internal applicable distractors followed. Today, bi- or tridirectional internal devices are already available. The whole treatment concept includes the orthodontist. Distraction planning before surgery is of great importance. The literature presently includes methods, indications, and case reports but only few results, which we compare with our experiences.
