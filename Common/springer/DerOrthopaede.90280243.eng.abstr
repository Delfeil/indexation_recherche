Culpable deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete illegality of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage. In cases of controversy it's the physician's due to prove the correct preoperative information. To reduce these liability-risks a computer based information system has been developed. With its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient. Based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place. After the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information. The conception's use over many years shows that overlooking essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached.
