On the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds, surgery rates and small-area variations within the catchment area of the AOK Magdeburg were examined for the year 1997. Substantial variation can be constantly seen. The extremal quotient at the 30 most frequent ICPM groups ranged from 2 to 5. Generally, the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute. Correlation analyses do not show clear associations with hospital bed supply and physician density in primary sectors. The extent of the small-area variation requires further research to evaluate possible determinants of surgery rates. Criteria for hospital admission and indications for surgery should be made explicit.
