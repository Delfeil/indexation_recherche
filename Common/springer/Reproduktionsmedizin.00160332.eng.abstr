The Federal Ministry of Health had organized a symposium on "Reproductive Medicine in Germany" which convened more than 600 participants in Berlin, from May 24th to 26th, 2000. The background for this conference is the unsolved political problem, whether it would be more suitable to reform the German Embryo Protection Act from January 1991, or to create a new "Reproductive Medicine Act" covering the whole field of human reproductive biology research and therapy. The first of seven key questions of this symposium dealt with the fundamental problem of the biological, ethical, and legal status of the early human embryo before implantation. New developments in reproductive and embryonic sciences suggest discussions also in Germany, whether early embryos should be used for research and therapeutic purposes. Interestingly, since 1990 Great Britain has decided on a legal commission to control high ranking research and therapy use of human embryos, however, this committee always is governed by highly responsible laymen. Such committee decisions essentially need the definition of the status of a human embryo before implantation, as well in vivo as also in vitro. If the German society wants to discuss the definition of the status of a non-implanted embryo, it would be necessary to include all aspects of such status, embryonic life and developmental potency in vivo and in vitro. By all means, one must not avoid to refer to the German Abortion Law (StGB § 218), the definition of which, scientificly false, uses implantation as the beginning of pregnancy. The German constitution, however, asks to protect human dignity from the point of time when fertilization is finished. Consequently, we should demand equal criteria for assessment and legal protection of early human embryonic life in vivo as in vitro before implantation.
