Objectives: The choice of cisatracurium, especially for patients with organ dysfunction, seems to be beneficial, because of organ-independent Hofmann-elimination and less histamine release propensity. This study was designed to investigate pharmacodynamics and intubating conditions after bolus administration of 0.15 mg/kg cisatracurium (3 x ED95) in patients with renal failure and maintained with isoflurane/N2O in oxygen.
