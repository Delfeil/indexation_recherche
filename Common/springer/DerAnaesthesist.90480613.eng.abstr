Objectives: Despite increasing use of oral opioids in cancer and non cancer pain, little is known about the effects of long-term opioid therapy on psychomotor performance. This study was designed to investigate the effects of long-term opioid analgesia on attention and reaction time in cancer pain and in non-malignant pain.
