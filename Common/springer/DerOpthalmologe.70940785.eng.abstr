Background: A major goal in research on intraocular lenses (IOL) is the development of new polymers and modifications to reduce foreign-body reactions after implantation. This effect may be achieved by a reduction in the surface hydrophobicity of the polymers. To illustrate the influence of surface modifications on bacterial adhesiveness, the most often isolated organism in "low-grade" postoperative endophthalmitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, was used.
