Background. Contamination of automated surgical equipment is widely disregarded as a potential source of perioperative infection. We investigated the possibility of contamination of the aspiration fluid by the vacuum control manifold (VCM). The normal, unsterile internal VCM was compared with a modified external VCM that was regularly disinfected.
