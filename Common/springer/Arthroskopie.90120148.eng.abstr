Popliteal arteriovenous fistula following knee surgery is a very rare complication. Reviewing the literature, only few such cases are mentioned following tibial head osteotomy, total knee arthroplasty or arthroscopy. We report the case of a 31-year-old man suffering from a pulsatile mass in the poplitea fossa 1 week after arthroscopic resection of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. Colour-Doppler sonography and angiography revealed a popliteal arteriovenous fistula about 4 months after arthroscopy. After dissection of the fistula and reconstruction of the popliteal artery and vein, the patient's complaints were promptly relieved. The literature covering vascular complications and their incidence in arthroscopy is reviewed
