In one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology, a vulvovaginitis can be diagnosed. Etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene, foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections. The microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli, and in case of chronical-recurrent discharge also B. fragilis and peptostreptococci. The symptoms are itching, burning, dysuria, discharge and rubor of the vulva. A systemic application of antibiotics is not necessary, a local treatment with antibiotic solutions is contraindicated and the usual vaginal suppositories are unsuitable for girls. A desinfection often irritates the vulvovaginal region of little girls so that for years we use estriol ointment only which is tolerated. Excellently, a single-dose application being sufficient; burning, itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence, so that the healing process is accelerated.
