The brain is an important target organ for gonadal hormones. Estrogens have protective and trophic effects on neural systems and modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems. Initial studies support the hypothesis that estrogen therapy in menopause may have protective effects toward the development of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, estrogens may improve verbal fluency, memory, and mood in elderly women. Still, the available evidence is not sufficient to support general treatment recommendations with respect to estrogens and the therapeutic targets dementia and depression.
