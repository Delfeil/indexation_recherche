The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors. Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors. Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n=98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment. Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy. In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.
