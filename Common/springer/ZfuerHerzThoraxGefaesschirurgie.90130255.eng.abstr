 Objective: In ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) alterations of the phenotype of myocyte are responsible for critical changes in the intracellular Ca2+-handling. These changes can substantially influence myocardial performance and favor ventricular arrhythmia. Therefore, we investigated whether and how changes in preload, afterload and frequency effect contractility, diastolic Ca2+-handling and resting tension in isolated human myocardium from patients with ICM. Methods: Small muscle strip preparations (0.5x5.0mm) were obtained from non-failing (NDH, n=11) and from non-infarcted areas of failing human hearts (ICM, n=8). Preparations were loaded with the Ca2+-indicator FURA-2 and mounted between a force transducer and servomotor (organ bath: 37 °C, oxygenated KHS). The influence of stimulation frequency (0.5-3Hz), preload (0.8-1.5L/Lmax) and afterload on force, passive resting tension and diastolic Ca2+-handling was measured. Results: 1) In NDH, peak isometric force was observed at 2Hz. In contrast, the ICM-myocardium developed maximum isometric force at 1Hz. At higher stimulation rates twitch tension was significantly reduced in ICM (p<0.0001). 2) Diastolic Ca2+-levels were elevated (p<0.0001) at higher stimulation frequencies (>1.5Hz), associated with parallel increase of diastolic resting tension in ICM (p<0.0001). 3) With increasing preload, force increased in NDH- and in ICM-myocardium. No significant difference in active force generation was observed (n.s.). 4) Passive resting tension was considerably elevated in ICM (p<0.0001). 5) During shortening, diastolic Ca2+-levels were significantly elevated in ICM (p<0.0001). Conclusions: The function of the Frank-Starling-Mechanism is maintained in ICM, whereas a negative force-frequency relationship and a disturbed diastolic Ca2+-homeostasis, which is associated with alterations in resting tension, may contribute to the impairment of myocardial performance in end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy.
