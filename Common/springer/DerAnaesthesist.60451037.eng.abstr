The cerebral haemodynamic effects of vasodilators are of clinical interest because a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) might alter global cerebral blood flow (CBF). Luxury perfusion of the brain, in contrast, might be unfavourable in patients with reduced intracranial compliance. Despite the widespread use of nitroglycerine (NTG), little is known about the cerebral haemodynamic consequences of NTG infusions in humans. This prospective, controlled study was designed: (1) to investigate the effects of NTG on CBF and cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity.
