 This contribution summarizes a discussion of experts in the field of bioelectrical impedance analysis, which was held at the Evangelische Akademie Loccum, Germany, May 12-13, 1999. Body composition can be most adequately measured by cumbersome methods. For routine use in clinical practice these tools are usually not available and are too expensive. For bedside assessment bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is considered a feasible and useful option. Body composition can be calculated from body impedance using formulas developed and validated by standard methods. This discussion in Loccum focused on the reliability of measured and calculated data, as well as their relevance for clinical decision making in nutritional therapy. The experts' opinion leads to the following statements: The reliability of calculating body composition from body resistance depends on the quality of the formula derived from reference measurements. Due to a shortage of adequate reference data for many diseases, validation of BIA measurement is mandatory for interindividual comparison in defined populations and with special regard to scientific purposes. BIA is useful for intraindividual follow up of body composition. The method is inappropriate to measure extreme shifts of extracellular mass and body water like "capillary leak syndrome" in the critically ill. Possible improvement using multifrequency BIA has to be awaited. In order to work out BIA integrated nutritional concepts, further work should focus even more on correlation of measured body impedance data (resistance, reactance, phase angle) and clinical outcome in different diseases.
