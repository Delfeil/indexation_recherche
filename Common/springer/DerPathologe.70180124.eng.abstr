The frequency and prognostic relevance of sarcoid-likelesions and microcarcinosis in regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer (n = 113; pT1-3, pN0-1, pM0, R0) were investigated; the prognostic value was compared with pT and pN stage, grading and Laurén's tumor classification with Cox's multivariate regression-model. Sarcoid like lesions were found in 34 % of the cases (n = 113). Statistical analysis did not indicate that they had any prognostic value or showed whether or not microcarcinosis or metastasis was present; they were independent of pT stage, histological tumor type, tumor grading, and the clinical course of disease. Microcarcinosis (defined as scattered carcinoma cells within lymph node sinuses or pulp without adjacent stromal reaction) was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 90 % of pN0 cases; the presence of 3 or more tumor cells per lymph node section in over 10 % of sampled lymph nodes per case carried a significant prognostic value. In microcarcinosis without evidence of metastasis, the number of tumor cells and the number of involved lymph nodes are of prognostic value. In pN1 cases microcarcinosis was found as well as the metastases in 97 % and had no additional prognostic value. Microcarcinosis alone has a different significance from lymph node metastasis for prognosis.
