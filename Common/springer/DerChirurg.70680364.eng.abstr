Duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas was developed 25 years ago by Beger. This procedure is indicated in patients suffering from chronic pain in combination with inflammation of the head of the pancreas, common bile duct obstruction, pancreatic duct obstruction and/or obstruction of the retropancreatic vessels. At the Inselspital in Berne, 74 patients underwent this operation between 1993 and 1996. The median length of the operation was 380 min, with the need for transfusion in a median of 0 units (0-6). There was no postoperative mortality. Total postoperative morbidity was 13 %. One patient needed relaparotomy on day 17 for small bowel obstruction. Median length of hospital stay was 11 days. Postoperatively, two patients developed diabetes. Duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas represents an organ-preserving principle of surgery. This procedure treats the complications of chronic pancreatitis and provides long-term pain relief in more than 80 % of patients.
