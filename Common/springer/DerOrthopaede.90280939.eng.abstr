Based upon the shortly presented survey among the members of the Swiss Medical Association for Manual Medicine, the low back pain problems are approached by the means of manual therapy on average 805 times per year and physician. On average each case with low back pain is treated 1,4 times by a general practitioner with experience in manual medicine while specialists who are dealing with more complexe cases on average 4 to 5 times. The functional disorders of the lumbar spine treated by manual therapy are superior to the physiotherapy approach or in comparison with a "placebo group" (information by general practitioner about low back pain and application of medication). An appropriate indication for manual therapy is relevant to avoid or reduce the possible risk of the treatment procedure. The physician who performs the manual therapy has to know the limits of the method. Also the knowledge of contraindications for manual therapy will reduce the incidence of possible complication. However based upon the survey among the swiss association the side effects and complications due to manual therapy of the lumbal spine are extremely seldom.
