Injections with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) are considered the first-line treatment for spasmodic torticollis (ST), blepharospasm (BL) and hemifacial spasm (HFS). Because BTX brings only temporary and partial relief, patients frequently try other additional therapies to minimize their symptoms. The subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with ST, BL and HFS was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire. Two hundred questionnaires were considered (112 TS, 54 BL, 34 HFS). BTX was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups (median: 2=good effect). Despite Citalopram and physiotherapy (median: 3=average effect), all other therapies were rated with a median of >=4 (=minimal effect). Patients with ST tried 7.7, patients with BL 2.4 and patients with HFS 2.6 different types of therapy. In conclusion, BTX is the most effective treatment for patients with ST, BL and HFS, as rated subjectively. Further evaluation of therapies additional to BTX injections is recommended.
