  Despite considerable progress in the knowledge about pathophysiology of cardiac allograft vascular disease (CAVD), only few systematic studies are available, characterizing the natural course during long-term follow-up after heart transplantation (HTX). Therefore, we analyzed in 354 heart transplant recipients (305 male, 45.9  +/-  11.2 years, mean observation period 5.8  +/-  3.0 years, range 0.9-12,4 years) the results of 1129 coronary angiograms under the aspects of development, severity, localization, and progression of disease related to the prognosis of patients.
