 The article emphasizes the criminalistic importance of beetles attracted by carrion and presents some groups (families, genera, species) of beetles frequently found on carrion in Middle Europe. The families Silphidae, Staphylinidae, Cleridae, and Dermestidae and some of their species are presented in more detail. As different species of necrophilic beetles prefer different stages of decay and are only attracted by carrion which has reached the preferred condition, the discovery of beetles on a dead body and their determination may provide additional information about time since death/since exposition. Moreover, some beetles do not occur ubiquitously but only in certain biotopes such as woodlands, open country, river banks and lowlands, etc., and may thus provide criminalistic information in cases if a body has been moved. Some collection and preservation methods are also briefly described.
