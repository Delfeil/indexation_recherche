In Europe and in the US ectoparasitic diseases are increasingly diagnosed in all classes of society. Modern means of transportation promote the spreading from endemic areas into new regions and therefore questions of therapy are becoming increasingly important. A series of preparations in various galenic formulations and in various concentrations are available to treat the ectoparasitic diseases. Due to reports on Lindane poisonings the clinical use of Lindane preparations for the treatment of scabies and pediculosis has become somewhat controversial. In this article we review older and more recent data on pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of -1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorcyclohexan [Lindane]. It is pointed out that in the USA Lindane is offered in 1% preparations whereas in the German speaking Europe only 0.3% preparations are available. This latter concentration is considered as sufficient to treat the ectoparasitosis. Furthermore the use of this remedy and aspects of Lindane resistance are discussed. It is concluded that only through additional in depth education of the patients and their folks successful treatment is possible and intoxication can be prevented.
