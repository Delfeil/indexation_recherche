 Currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors. One of them is the precise handling of optics. Up to now, in our hospital 52 laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice - controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder, stomach, large bowel and hernia operations. The visual field is determined by the surgeon. In all cases handling of the robot arm was precise and the voice response exact and without technical problems. Twenty-nine operations were done by one operator as "solo surgeries". In 20 further cases there was one assistant. A robot arm can be used successfully without problems by any laparoscopic surgeon in any operating theater.
