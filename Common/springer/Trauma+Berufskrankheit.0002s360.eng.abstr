We present the results of a study conducted in collaboration with the German workers' board to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in 477 cases. The examiners reviewed the charts of patients who had suffered distorsion or luxation of the knee, fractures of the spine with or without neural deficits, calcaneus fractures, rotator cuff lesions and shoulder luxation, and fractures of the acetabulum and pelvis as the result of accidents. A new documentation sheet was desiged to note administrative and medical data. All 477 patients' charts and X-rays were reviewed by three trauma surgeons, and procedures were monitored in a prospective manner. The study revealed considerable discrepancies between the assumed injuries and those ultimately found to have been sustained, especially in the case of knee injuries. The article reveals the results concerning the validity of the diagnosis and the need for more precisely tailored diagnostic methods for different patient groups. Our final conclusion is that it is necessary to implement new paths of patient management and better steering features to improve both the quality of medical care and the administrative procedures in place.
