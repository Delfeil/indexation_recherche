We report three patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). On clinical examination, no sensory deficit was elicited. Electromyography (EMG) and motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies were indicative of an axonal lesion. In two patients, we found total peripheral conduction block without volitional EMG activity. Sensory NCV and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal. Sural nerve biopsy revealed unequivocal alterations of sensory nerve fibers, some in the form of primary demyelination. Therefore, these cases must bei classified as combined motor-sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings. Although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred, causing tetraparalysis, this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant. In contrast to positive reports in literature, immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases.
