Abstract   In a 32 years old professional handball layer, the micro-traumata typical of this game led to retropatellar cartilage lesion, which became sympthomatic following an distortion-impact trauma. Since the patient remaind symptomatic after initial conservative treatment as well as arthroscopic chondroplastic, osteo-chondral transplantation was performed. There was a good functional result 6 months after surgery.
