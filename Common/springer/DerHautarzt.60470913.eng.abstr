Based on molecular data, the genus Trichosporon was recently reclassified. Six human pathogenic species, which are closely related to specific types of infections can be differentiated. By means of commercial test systems and simple key criteria according to Gueho et al. [15], 44 isolates that had been identified as Tr. cutaneum between 7/92 and 1/96, were reclassified. The evaluation of clinical data also included 66 isolates that had not been preserved, and 27 strains of Tr. inkin. Trichosporon species were found in 4.8% of all yeast isolates (3.8% Tr. cutaneum, 1% Tr. inkin). Nearly every other isolate of Tr. cutaneum was cultivated from nail material, while Tr. inkin was mainly isolated from skin in the anogenital region. In 38 cases, reclassification revealed Tr. mucoides; Tr. ovoides and Tr. asteroides were identified in 3 cases each, while Tr. asahii, an especially remarkable pathogen in systemic mycoses, was not found. Clinically, isolates of Tr. mucoides were predominant in toenail mycoses which might be considered in the therapy of onychomycosis. Furthermore, isolates from the skin should be evaluated with respect to the increasing incidence of systemic Trichopsoron mycoses.
