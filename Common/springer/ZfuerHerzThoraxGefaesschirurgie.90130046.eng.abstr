  This case report describes a 62 years old patient who suffered from therapy resisten atrial fibrillation for 12 years. She underwent "Cox/Maze-III-Procedure" during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved. Two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility. Therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics could be discontinued.
