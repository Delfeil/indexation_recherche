 Impaired arterial oxygenation due to a true intrapulmonary shunting is a key feature of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and every effort should be made to improve oxygen delivery to the body's tissues. In patients with ARDS an improvement in the arterial oxygenation can be obtained only by reopening previously closed airspaces, and the application of PEEP has been recognized, for a long time, as the method of choice to reach this goal. Therefore, the relationships between PEEP and alveolar recruitment are an issue of great clinical interest.
