In the severely resorbed maxilla, a 10-year success rate of only 49-74% of implants in combination with autogenous bone grafts has been reported. We developed a modified technique of antral inlay grafting and lateral and vertical onlay grafting of the severely resorbed maxilla for inserting implants to retain dentures. The clinical and radiologic results are presented. In 21 patients with severely resorbed edentulous maxillae, a total of 20 bilateral and one unilateral antral inlay graftings and lateral and vertical onlay graftings were performed after a prosthodontic setup. We opened the maxillary sinus by removing a bony window from the anterolateral wall and, after elevation of the sinus lining, grafted the sinus floor with corticocancellous iliac crest bone grafts. The maxilla was also augmented in the lateral and vertical direction. The bone grafts were fixed by osteosynthesis. After a median of 5 months, a total of 134 implants (Brånemark) were placed and later loaded by prosthodontic rehabilitation. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken before the grafting procedure, immediately after grafting, after 4 months, and every year thereafter. A total of 94.8% of the implants were successful at the time of the abutment operation. After loading, two additional failures were seen in an average follow-up period of 2.5 years. Most patients were provided with implant-borne dentures. CT scans showed an average initial gain of vertical bone height of 3.7-17.7 mm. One year after grafting, a loss of 1.3 mm or 7% occurred. In the following 2 years, no major atrophy was observed. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between sex, bone height before augmentation, augmented bone height, and resorption of the grafted bone. We observed undisturbed healing and obtained large vertical bone heights, a high success rate, minimal resorption, and fully satisfactory prosthodontic rehabilitation; we can thus recommend our modified technique of reconstruction of the severely resorbed maxilla for routine use.
