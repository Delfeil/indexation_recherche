Fatty acids play a central role among the epidermal lipids because of their considerable contribution to structural and functional features of the epidermis. They are important components of cell membranes, the intercellular stratum corneum lipids and the hydro-lipid skin surface film. Additionally, endogenous fatty acids act as mediators of the epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation and therefore, lipid synthesis and also as mediators of inflammatory and immunological processes.
