The branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR syndrome) is characterized by auricular abnormalities, lateral cervical fistulas and preauricular tags. The hearing impairment may be a conductive, a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss. The renal disease is oligomeganephronia, a bilateral, congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of nephrons. The BOR syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disease.
