Psychoanalytic Self Psychology is presented as a postmodern paradigm for the analysis of the postpatriarchical self with the methodological approach of introspection and empathy. The limited possibilities of psychoanalytic treatment particularly with patients with a narcissistic disorder led Heinz Kohut to the hypothesis of a particular developmental line of narcissism and the motivational primacy of the self which he conceptualized as bipolar. Sexual and aggressive behaviour is subsequently seen as primary only if there is a coherent, vital and not fragmented self. Substantial conditions of self coherence are selfobject experiences, which are presented in their multiplicity as are disorders of the self. Selfobject experiences lead to the main forms of transference as seen by Psychoanalatic Self Psychology. A short synopsis of the therapeutic process and of the integration of infant research into Self Psychology as well as a different view of the oedipal conflict completes this survey together with some final remarks about a few new concepts in Psychoanalytic Self Psychology.
