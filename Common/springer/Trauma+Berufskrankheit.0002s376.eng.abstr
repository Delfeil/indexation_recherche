Indirect trauma to the shoulder and knee joint often results in injuries to the ligaments and the capsule, and more rarely in fractures. Anterior shoulder dislocation is common. Over the last few years arthroscopic repair of the torn labrum has become established as the therapy of choice. Isolated ruptures of the collateral ligaments of the knee can be treated functionally. A torn anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint can be compensated by the quadriceps muscle if this is adequately prepared by special exercises. Chronic or combined instabilities should be treated surgically by ACI grafting techniques. Menisceal injuries are treated arthroscopically.
