With part VII of the Social Code (SGB VII), the data protection in accident insurance has been become subject to specific and systematic regulation for the first time. This new regulation follows the principles laid down for data protection in general in terms of clarity of standards, transparency and necessity. It resolves some of the previous problematic questions, but also raises some new ones. Specimen case instructions and a number of forms developed by the HVBG (statutory accident prevention and insurance institution in industry) are used to clarify how it can be applied in practice. The following questions, which have been to the fore from the viewpoint of the accident insurance institutions since the SGB VII came into force, are discussed: initial data collection from insured persons, appointment of experts and involvement of the insured persons, distinction between medical consultants appointed by the accident insurance institutions and medical experts, agreement of the insured persons to the data collection, feedback from accident insurance institutions to medical experts.
