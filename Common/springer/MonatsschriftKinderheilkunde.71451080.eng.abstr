Objektive: Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy occurs at a frequency of 0,6-2,5 per 1000 births. 80-95% of these lesions recover spontaneously. Should spontaneous recovery not occur within the first 6 months of life, electrophysiological examination CT-Myelography, and surgical exploration of the brachial plexus are recommended.
