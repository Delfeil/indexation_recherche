Abstract  An overview of the research literature on the health of mothers reveals that although the number of empirical surveys in German-speaking and English-speaking countries has increased during recent years, the current state of research is nevertheless unsatisfactory. Studies are described in the literature which examine the connections between the health of mothers or women and their social, family and occupational situations. However, the psychodynamic background of psychosomatic illness has hardly been recognized at all in these studies. Our own clinical experience indicates that psychodynamic connections are of importance in the causes of the psychodynamic illness of mothers. Thus for some mothers the desire to have children is an attempt to compensate current conflicts that have already existed before pregnancy. In other mothers unsolved neurotic conflicts that have existed within their relationship with their own parents since childhood are renewed, and the patients are unable to cope with them. Considerable deficits exist with regard to the medical care of this clientele. With many mothers outpatient therapies fail because their children cannot be looked after while they are undergoing treatment, and the inpatient psychosomatic treatment of the mothers together with their children is only rarely possible. Outpatient psychotherapeutic concepts of treatment which could replace inpatient treatment do not exist either in this country or abroad. Considerable deficits exist with regard to the medical care of this clientele, leading to consequences which can hardly be assessed for the further development of mothers and children.
