The different subgroups of hypercalciuria cannot be separated clearly by the Pak calcium-load test. To improve the diagnosis and therapy we examined all relevant parameters of calcium metabolism in 32 patients with calcium urolithiasis and hypercalciuria (> 6.25 mmol/day). We also conducted bone mineral density measurements as well as the Pak calcium-load test. In most cases the pathophysiological constellations which Pak takes as the basis for his classification of hypercalciuria could not be shown. To date, diagnostics only insufficiently explains the genesis of hypercalciuria (except pHPT). As a consequence, a therapeutic problem arises: a low-calcium diet should not be generally recommended, since some patients may develop osteopenia. From our investigation the following diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions can be drawn: (1) Hypercalciuria in primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated by surgical removal of the adenoma. (2) The parathormone-independent osteogenic form should be treated with thiazides. (3) Hypercalciuria with increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D should be treated by low-calcium diet.
