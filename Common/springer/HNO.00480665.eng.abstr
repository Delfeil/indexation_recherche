Orbital pseudotumor is a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology that can be divided histopathologically into three basic types: granulomatous, lymphoid, and sclerosing. Between 1995 and 1998, 12 patients with pseudotumor orbitae were treated in the ENT Department of the University of Saarland. Histopathological examination showed granulomatous type of pseudotumor in six, lymphoid in three, and sclerosing in three patients. In seven cases the pseudotumor orbitae were medially located and in four cases laterally. In one patient nearly all orbital structures were infiltrated.
