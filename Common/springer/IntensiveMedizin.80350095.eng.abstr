 Oxygen radicals play a dual role in sepsis. On the one hand they contribute to the killing of pathogenic microorganisms, but on the other, produced in excess, they may cause severe disruption of proteins, DNA, RNA, and carbohydrates which leads, e. g., to membrane leakages (lipid peroxidation) and a capillary leak syndrome. In septic patients plasma levels of malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes are increased and those of -tocopherol, retinol, and -carotene are decreased. Moreover, the urinary excretion of nitrite, nitrate, and vitamin A is increased. The results in the literature on the formation of oxygen radicals by leucocytes (respiratory burst) are conflicting. Although several pharmacological and nutritional antioxidants have been used in experimental studies, relevant clinical studies are lacking. Dosage recommendations for septic patients are given for vitamin E (300 mg/d), vitamin C (1000 mg/d), -carotene (20 mg/d), and also for trace elements responsible for the activity of oxygen radical reducing enzymes, such as copper (3 mg/d), zinc (10 - 30 mg/d), and selenium (300 - 500 µg/d).
