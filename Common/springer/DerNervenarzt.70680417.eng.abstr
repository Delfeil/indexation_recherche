We are reporting about a 35 year old female forensic patient who has a double diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, bingeeating/purging type, and schizophrenia, paranoid type. She repeatedly attacked her therapists and physicians violently. Her aggressive state is a result of her psychotic interpretation of her constant preoccupation with her body image. We discuss problems concerning antipsychotic medication in her case specifically. Furthermore epidemiological aspects of the comorbidity of eating disorders and schizophrenia are considered; the incidence of schizophrenia in eating disorders seems to be 1-3%, affective and transient psychosis being more common; the comorbidity of schizophrenia and bulimia nervosa is very rare.
