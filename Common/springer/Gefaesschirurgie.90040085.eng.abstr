 Introduction: The efficacy of vascular surgery in the treatment of popliteal arterial aneurysms (PAA) and the justification of conservative therapy was investigated in the present study. Materials and methods: From January 1985 to December 1996, 87 patients were operated on for PAA. The clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients were categorized concerning PAA-related symptoms, vascular run-off, and material used for vascular reconstruction. Patients were examined, and the patency of the vascular reconstruction was checked by palpation and Doppler sonography. Results: The cumulative survival calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curve was 70% after 10 years. Asymptomatic patients had the best results and patients with acute ischemia, the worst. The outcome concerning patent vs. occluded run-off and autologous vs. heterologous bypass material was similar. Conclusion: Asymptomatic and uncomplicated PAA should be treated surgically. Only PAA with a diameter less than 2 cm, and without thrombus on the vessel walls can be treated conservatively.
