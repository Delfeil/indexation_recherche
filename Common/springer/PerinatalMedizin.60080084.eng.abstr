Active glucocorticoids (GCS), such as cortisol or corticosterone, are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung. In fetal serum, biologically inactive metabolites (cortisone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone) outweigh the active forms. In this study we demonstrate with organoid cultures of fetal rat lungs that the reductive side of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) regulates the intracellular activation of GCS. The inhibition of 11-HSD by the licorice extract glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibits this central metabolism. On the other hand, GCS induce the reductive activity of 11-HSD and, therefore, they increase their own activation by positive feedback.
