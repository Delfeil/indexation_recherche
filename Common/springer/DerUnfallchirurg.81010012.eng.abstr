Humeral shaft fractures can be treated either conservatively or operatively. Plating of the humerus is the established operative method, but recently interest has also been focussed on intramedullary nailing. Fifty-nine cases of humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (Seidel/Marchetti-Vicenzi/Prévot) from January 1991 to December 1995 (44 fractures after trauma, 11 pathological fractures, 3 pseudarthroses, 1 re-fracture). Closed reduction in 55/59 cases. One infection (soft tissue); 2/48 pseudarthrosis (indication for nailing: pseudarthrosis!). No iatrogenic palsy of the radial nerve. Functional postoperative treatment in all 44 cases of humeral fractures after adequate trauma. One poor functional result: periarticular ossification after retrograde nailing, possibly connected with long-term respiratory treatment after trauma. Treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary nailing is favoured in our clinic (low complication rates, excellent or good functional results, limited approaches, small scars). Proximal fractures should be treated by the Seidel nail (stable interlocking of the proximal fragment); very distal fractures need Prévot nailing (reaming of condylar canals). All other fractures of the humeral shaft can be treated by each of the implants used in our clinic. Pathological fractures are an excellent indication for intramedullary stabilization. These patients benefit from stable fixation without intense surgical trauma. Pseudarthrosis, according to our limited experience, seems to require plating plus bone grafting. Plating is also recommended if revision of the radial nerve becomes necessary.
