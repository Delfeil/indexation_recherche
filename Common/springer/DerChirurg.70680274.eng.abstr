The PEG-ileus is a complication of the intestinal migration of the "bumper". The resulting obstruction or perforation is usually located in the ileum. Patients with hernias, who have a possible or known intrinsic or extrinsic stenosis or who have been X-rayed in the area of the small pelvis, are not suitable for the application of Korula's "migration"-technique with the scheduled intestinal elimination of the "bumper". "Bumpers" that are allowed to remain in the stomach for a long time lose their elasticity and frequently cause a PEG-ileus. When choosing the type of gastrostomy, we should consider which technique could be used in the case of a change or a removal of the material.
