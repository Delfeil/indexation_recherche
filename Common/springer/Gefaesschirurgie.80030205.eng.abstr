 Perhaps the most important event in relation to the vascular and lymphovenous group of malformations has been the development of a classification which is useful to physicians, patients, and parents. The broad classification consists of hemangiomas and vascular malformations; the latter group is further subdivided into venous, arteriovenous, and lymphovenous malformations [5, 11]. Hemangiomas are present at or just after birth in 40% of infants. They grow rapidly and involute slowly; there is increased endothelial cell activity. Venous malformations are present at birth in 70% of cases; they grow with the child and have a normal rate of endothelial cell turnover. Lymphovenous malformations occur at an early age and may or may not resolve. Arteriovenous malformations are usually progressive. The treatment is a combination of embolization and surgery.
