 This paper reviews the recent literature concerning the prevalence and prognostic significance of arrhythmias occurring during exercise testing.  Supraventricular arrhythmias can occasionally be found during exercise testing in apparently healthy individuals. Even supraventricular tachycardias do not portend increased cardiovascular mortality or cardiac events. In patients with heart disease exercise induced supraventricular arrhythmias are seen more frequently.  Ventricular premature beats during exercise testing are frequent findings in healthy individuals as well as in patients with heart disease. In patients with coronary heart disease, they are associated with exercise induced ischemia.  In patients with coronary heart disease, especially in postmyocardial infarction patients, frequent ventricular premature beats, couplets and ventricular tachycardia provide independent prognostic information beyond that provided by other diagnostic tools. Especially patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias, low maximum work load, and low maximum systolic blood pressure during exercise have an increased risk of major cardiac events and cardiac mortality. Ventricular premature beats that disappear or decrease during exercise have the same prognostic value as arrhythmias that are exercise induced or show increased frequency during exercise testing.
