Adhesion molecules are cell surface proteins responsible for cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. They represent a basis for physiologic and pathologic processes, especially for homing behavior, homeostasis of the immune response, inflammations and tumor metastasis. Recently, adhesions molecules such as CD44v6 have been shown to be expressed on tumor cells of cutaneous lymphomas with systemic tumor spread and thus play an important role in metastasis.
