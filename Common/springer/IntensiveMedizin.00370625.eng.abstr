 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease which occurs in over 80% in women during childbearing years. We report the case of a 69 year old man with known SLE who was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. Radiology showed diffuse acinar infiltrates in the lower lung fields. Because of progressive respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation was necessary. The radiographic findings had changed and diffuse alveolar opacities were documented. The chest HR-CT showed a bibasilar ground glass appearence and diffuse alveolar interstitial infiltrates. Bronchoscopy was performed and pulmonary hemorrhage was found. After exclusion of a pulmonary infection, immunosuppressive therapy with systemic corticosteroids and cyclophophamide was started because of the suspicion of lupus pneumonitis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndrome. Two days later, the patient died of septic shock in spite of antibiotic therapy. Our suspicion could be confirmed by histology of the lung.   Acute lupus pneumonitis (1-12%) and the alveolar hemorrhage syndrome (10-20%) are uncommon complications in SLE with a mortality rate of more than 50%. If the outcome is to be improved, diagnosis has to be established timely and immunosuppressive therapy has to be started immediately.
