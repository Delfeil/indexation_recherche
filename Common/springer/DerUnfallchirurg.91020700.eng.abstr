Between May 1981 and December 1993, 120 patients (126 knee joints) were operated using the Elsmlie-Trillat procedure because of patella(sub)luxation. 79 patients were reviewed at an average follow up of 4.1 (1-13.6) years. 46 women and 33 men were operated with an average age at operation of 26.9 (14-59) years. The examination included Bentley's Score, radiological parameters (e. g. grading of patella dislocation), grading of chondromalacia and patient characteristics (e. g. age, pre-operative time). 64 knee joints (70.3 %) were evaluated 'very good' and 'good', using the score of Bentley. There were significantly worse results in cases with higher grading of chondromalacia (p <0.0036), longer pre-operative time (p < 0.012) and older patients (p < 0.0023). The worst and most highly significant results were in these patients with prior knee surgery (p < 0.0001). A good patella relocation correlated with improved results (p < 0.001). There was no difference in cases with patella dislocation and/or patellasubluxation. In conclusion, the Elmslie-Trillat procedure should be carried out 'in the correct manner and at an early stage'. To optimise the therapy in cases of patella dislocation the high number of operation techniques should be analysed and used regarding risk groups.
