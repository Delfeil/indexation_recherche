 Arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication following vascular trauma. We report a case of an arteriovenous fistula of the neck after a penetrating injury. The only presenting symptoms were a thrill and a machinery murmur. There were no signs of cardiac insufficiency. Duplex scan and arteriography detected an arteriovenous fistula between the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein. Surgical therapy was straight-forward. Treatment should be carried out as soon as possible, and is then usually simple and successful.
