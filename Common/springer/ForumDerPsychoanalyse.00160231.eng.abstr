 In recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother-daughter-relationship with the conceptions of the 'lesbian complex' (Poluda-Korte), the 'symbiotic illusion' (Halberstadt-Freud), the 'higher permeability of the ego-boundaries' (Rohde-Dachser), and the 'conflict of separation-individuation which has to be resolved again and again throughout life' (Berger). In the light of these conceptions it is hypothesized that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender (female-female psychoanalyses) a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre-oedipal mother-daughter-relationship are revided. Case vignettes and a literary example illustrate the risks as well as possible resolutions engendered by these early relationship dynamics, as these are reactivated in the here and now of the analyst's relationship towards her patient.
