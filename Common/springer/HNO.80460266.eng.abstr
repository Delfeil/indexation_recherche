Laryngeal candidiasis is very rare in the absence of other more proximal diseases in the aerodigestive tract. The lesion shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or acanthosis and, given its rarity, may be confused with cancer. In the present paper we report on a 56-year-old male patient who presented with hoarseness. Physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords. The clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient (ten bottles of beer and 40 cigarettes per day) generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer. A biopsy was taken. The histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma; however, it could not provide a clear diagnosis. Laryngeal papillomatosis and tuberculosis, which had been suspected, could be excluded. As the lesion progressed, further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis. Systemic antimycotic treatment with fluconazol and amphotericin caused a complete remission.
