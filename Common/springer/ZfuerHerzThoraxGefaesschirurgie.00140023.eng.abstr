 Introduction: In port-access cardio-surgical procedures, both intraoperative TEE and continuous fluoroscopy are used for placement of the catheters needed for extracorporeal circulation. Our study sought to clarify whether it is possible to rely exclusively on TEE for catheter placement without increasing the risk for the patient. Methods: 32 patients undergoing cardiac procedures employing the Port-Access technique were included in the study. Fluoroscopy as well as TEE were used for placement of the transjugular and transfemoral extracorporal circulation catheters. The time required for fluoroscopy was noted.
