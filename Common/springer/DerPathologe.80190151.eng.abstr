We report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient. The foamy cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed S-100 and Vimentin. HMB45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma. Detection of HMB45 in some of the nevus-associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation.
