 Historic development of extracorporeal circulation began with the perfusion of isolated organs by physiologists in the 19th century. Those experiments led to the development of the basic principles of the perfusion technique, such as bubble-oxygenation and film-oxygenation, systems for pulsatile pumping and the closed extracorporeal circuit. The idea for using extracorporeal circulation for cardiovascular surgery was born at the beginning of the 20th century.
