Painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill-defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat. The nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder, adhesive capsulitis, focal algodystrophy, stiff shoulder, contracted shoulder, and others. Apart from its idiopathic form, the disease can be initiated by trauma, infection, tumour, radiation, systemic and local metabolic disturbances. Pathoanatomically, the common denominator is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening, scarring, and retraction of the joint capsule. The inflammatory process often starts at the rotator interval and may extend to the subacromial space.
