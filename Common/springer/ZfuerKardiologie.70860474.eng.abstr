  The finding of an extremely mobile thrombus in a patent foramen ovale (i.e., transit thrombus) without arterial embolism is rare. In our case-report diagnosis was made by routine-echocardiography. Clinically nonapparent deep vein thrombosis was documented by phlebography and was thought to be the origin of the embolus. After implantation of a caval filter device cardiac surgery was performed and the embolus was removed without complications.
