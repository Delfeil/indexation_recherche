Purpose: To evaluate a new ultrasonographic imaging technique of the pancreas (hydrosonography), based on a combination of chemical intestinal paralysis and water distension of the stomach and duodenum, regarding its significance for tumor detection, staging and assessment of tumor resectability.  Material and methods: In an open prospective study 51 patients with suspected pancreatic neoplasm were examined between July 1995 and October 1995. The technique of hydrosonography included intravenous injection of 40 mg N-butylscopolaminiumbromid (Buscopan) and maximum gastric and duodenal wall distension by oral administration of an average of 1 l warm tap water (0.5-1.5 l). A detailed evaluation form was used to assess (1) overall imaging quality; (2) accuracy of identification of the pancreas in its various anatomic regions and of peripancreatic vessel structures relevant for resectability, such as splenic, superior mesenteric, and portal veins, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric, splenic and hepatic arteries; and (3) tumor size, sonographic structure and level of organ and vessel infiltration. As gold standards for positive tumor detection and description, surgery and microscopic diagnosis were used, and for negative tumor detection, event-free survival of 6 months.  Results: All examinations were diagnostic. Identification of the pancreas was complete in all 51 patients with an excellent overall imaging quality in 53 %. In 86 % of cases the various examined organ and vessel structures were depicted with either good or average imaging quality. In 48 of the 51 patients diagnosis positive for tumor or other organ pathology was made. A total of 16 pancreatic carcinomas and 5 benign tumors were diagnosed. Twenty-seven patients had pathology not related to a pancreatic neoplasm. For tumor detection, sensitivity was 82 % and specificity 100 %. For correct assessment of tumor resectability, sensitivity was 86 % and specificity 100 %.  Conclusion: The new technique of hydrosonography combines the value of routine non-invasive abdominal ultrasound with increased sensitivity and specificity for tumor detection and assessment of resectability by improved imaging accuracy.
