We report on a 8 year old boy in whom ophthalmological signs (scotoma, fundus hypertonicus stage IV) and an elevated blood pressure lead to the diagnosis of an isolated pheochromocytoma of the left adrenal. 6 months before, a cerebral convolsion was interpreted as a benign convulsion caused by infection. The boy was cured by adrenalectomy. However, 3 years after the initial diagnosis, he showed again typical clinical signs of a pheochromocytoma which was finally confirmed by laboratory tests and computertomography. The right adrenal was removed. Family history was negative. By molecular analysis, an association with von Hippel-Lindau disease was found.
