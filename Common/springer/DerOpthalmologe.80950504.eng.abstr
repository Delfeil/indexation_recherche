There are estimated to be 20 million people blinded by cataracts, 80-90 % of whom live in rural areas of developing countries where expert surgical resources are scarce. The majority of all cataract operations are still intracapsular extractions (ICCE). Aphakic correction using spectacles is problematical in developing countries. This study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of multiflex open loop anterior chamber intraocular lenses (AC IOLs).
