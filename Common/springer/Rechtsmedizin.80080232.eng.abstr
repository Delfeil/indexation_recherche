Abstract  Hepatitis C antibodies have been detected in more then half of all autopsies of drug-related deaths in a 2-year period since November 1995 in Aachen, Germany. It was of interest whether there is a risk of HCV transmission from the corpses. The presence of HCV-RNA indicates infectiosity in the living but this may be different post-mortem. To our knowledge no case of HVC infection from a corpse has been reported so far.
