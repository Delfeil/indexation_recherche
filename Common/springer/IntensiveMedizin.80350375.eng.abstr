 To prevent nosocomial pneumonia in the postoperative setting, it is important to take into account the endogenous risk factors in the preoperative and postoperative phase. This includes optimal drug therapy of an obstructive lung disease, respiratory therapy in the preoperative phase, use of an incentive spirometer or intermittent positive pressure breathing on patients at high risk of developing pneumonia in the postoperative phase, and instructing preoperative patients to stop smoking. Further measures are optimising the treatment of other predisposing diseases and the nutritional status, appropriate analgesic drug therapy in patients with postoperative pain during breathing, prefering nonsedative analgesic drugs, early mobilization, and withdrawal or reduction of immunsuppressive drugs in the preoperative and postoperative setting if not contraindicated. The preoperative phase of treatment should be managed in an ambulant setting, which is superior to hospitalization with respect to the nosocomial infection rate. There is also a positive correlation of the duration of postoperative hospital stay and the rate of postoperative nosocomial pneumonia. Thus, patients should not be hospitalized longer than necessary. Predisposing exogenous risk factors such as enteral feeding tubings should be replaced as soon as possible. Beside this, basic care and standard good quality hygienic measures are important in preventing postoperative pneumonia.
