We examined the prevalence of HIV-associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of UV-radiation in HIV-infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of 1310 patients seen between and 1994 and 1996. 41 patients were treated with UVB-radiation and 4 patients with UVA1-radiation, while three patients received PUVA-therapy. UV-radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Although some in vitro studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested a negative impact of UV radiation on the immunosystem of HIV-positive patients, no progression of the HIV infection due to phototherapy has been proven.
