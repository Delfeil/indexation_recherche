Morbihan's disease was first reported as a distinct entity in 1957 by Degos, describing a chronic persistent erythema and oedema of the upper half of the face. Such conditions have been noted in the literature designated as chronic lymphoedema or solid persistent facial oedema in acne or rosacea. The characteristic features are a chronic course, a typical clinical picture, lack of specific laboratory and histological findings and refractoriness to therapeutic measures.
