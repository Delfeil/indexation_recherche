The prosthetic rehabilitation of cranio-facial defects and malformations has made enormous progress with the development of currently available silicones and the discovery of titanium as an optimally bicompatible implant material. This allows for a reliable, solid fixation of cranio-facial prostheses, which, due to modern production techniques, give outstanding camouflage to defects. To reconstruct such complex aesthetic entities as the ear, nose and orbit, bone-anchored prostheses now represent more than just an alternative to plastic surgery. Their removal also allows early recognition of recurrences following tumor surgery. The principles of implantology and all commercially available systems are presented, as well as indications, contraindications and our personal experience with 120 patients who received bone-anchored prostheses at the ENT Department of the University of Saarland in Homburg, Germany.
