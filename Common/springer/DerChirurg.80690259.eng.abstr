 Background: The therapy for early gastric cancer (endoscopy, gastric resection, D1/2 dissection) is controversial. Materials and methods: In a retrospective study (4/ 86 -12/ 95) we analyzed the prognosis of 57 early gastric cancer patients with respect to pathological findings and surgical therapy. Results: The R0 resection rate was 100 %. In 7 % multifocal tumor growth was seen. The 5-year survival rate was 70 %. LN-metastases were found in 12 % of all cases, more often in pT1 b than in pT1 a tumors (17 vs 9 %) and more often in large carcinomas than in small carcinomas ( > 1000 mm2: 27 %; < 300 mm2: 0 %). Long-term survival was significantly better in pN0 patients than in patients with LN metastasis (P = 0.020). Conclusion: Prognosis of early gastric cancer after curative resection is good.
