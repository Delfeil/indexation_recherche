Background: The mechanical stabilization of the cornea in keratoconus may delay progression of this disease. The cross-linking techniques optimized in corneas of enucleated porcine eyes were investigated under in vivo conditions in rabbits to estimate the biocompatibility and duration of the stiffening effect.
