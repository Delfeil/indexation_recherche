 A postal survey targeted at 1000 firms in the metal- and electronic working industry of Northrhine Westfalia was carried out by Sozialforschungsstelle Dortmund und Institute of geronotology to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement. As the results show, firms in Northrhine Westfalia are willing to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve. Firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement. Therefore partial retirement is created as a so-called "blocked model".
