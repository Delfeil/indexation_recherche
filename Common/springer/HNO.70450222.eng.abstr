Ionomer-based cements are obtained by the reaction of an aluminum-fluoro-silicate glass with a polyalcenoic acid. During setting and hardening the cement bonds closely with adjacent hard tissue. The previous implantation of this material in the baboon tibia has held great promise as a possible use in bone replacement. In the present study the cement was tested concerning its biocompatibility and biostability in the middle ears of 64 rabbits. Viscid cement paste was inserted into the epitympanic space of each animal. A preformed cement strut was then placed to serve as a columella between the eardrum and stapes footplate. During a subsequent interval of 28 days up to 2 years middle ear specimens were evaluated under a surgical microscope, following which histologic sections were studied under light microscopic conditions. Findings demonstrated that after insertion of freshly mixed cement a firm adhesion to bone developed that proved to be biocompatible and biostable over time. After 28 days the preformed and fully hardened implants were overgrown by a delicate mucosa normally present in the middle ear. No evidence for any rejection of the implants could be found.
