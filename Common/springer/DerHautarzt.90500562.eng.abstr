As a premalignant condition, actinic cheilitis requires therapy, and multiple treatment modalities have been described. Although frequently reported in Angloamerican literature, CO2 laser vaporization for the treatment of actinic cheilitis is scarcely mentioned in German journals. We report 19 cases of CO2 laser treatment of actinic cheilitis. In only one case, the ablation proved to be too superficial after the first treatment. Except in this case we did not see any recurrences and only one case with minor scarring within a median follow up period of 16 months. In comparison with other treatment modalities, we consider the CO2 laser ablation to be a safe and cost-saving method with excellent cosmetic results.
