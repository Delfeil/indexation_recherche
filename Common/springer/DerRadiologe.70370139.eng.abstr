Aim and methods: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the MRI criteria of infectious spondylitis (spondylodiscitis). The MR images of 23 patients suffering from spondylodiscitis (78 % unspecific, 22 % specific) were retrospectively analyzed.  Results: The height of the intervertebral discs involved was normal in 40 %, reduced in 43 % and increased in 17 % of the cases. The most common findings can be summarized in an MR triad: 1) The vertebral bodies involved are hypointense in T1-weighted images (100 %) with a lack of delineation of the intervertebral discs (53 %). 2) The injection of Gd-DTPA yields an enhancement of the vertebral bodies involved and intervertebral discs (95 % and 74 % respectively). 3) The vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs are hyperintense in T2-weighted sequences (76 % and 90 % respectively).
