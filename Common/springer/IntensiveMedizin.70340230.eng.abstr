 Efforts of control and improve quality of structure, processes, and outcome should be considered as components of an overall quality management in intensive care. To measure quality, standards are useful in the field of structure quality only, because of their high level of obligation, often mandated by legislation. Conferences, continuing education, and guidelines are the instruments to measure and improve quality of processes and outcome. Outcome is determined by survival rate and quality of life of surviving patients. Outcome quality in individual units my be compared with the predicted risk of mortality (standardized mortality index), calculated from score systems. Standards and guidelines should be further developed and methods of outcome management be improved.
