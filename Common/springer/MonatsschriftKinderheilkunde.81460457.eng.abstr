Objective: Hypoplastic left heart (HLH) is a complex developmental malformation of the left ventricle, aorta, and associated valves. Survival beyond neonatal period is the exception in untreated infants. The prognosis, however, is no longer hopeless. Clinical stabilization of a neonate with HLH is appropriate until a management decision, based on appropriate parental counselling, can be made.
