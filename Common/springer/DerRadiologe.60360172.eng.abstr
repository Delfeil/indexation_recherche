The Schering Atlas is a teaching file in CT and MRI anatomy designed for physicians and students. It is available on CD-ROM, shows good image quality, and is easy to use in medium-price-range personal computer systems. Because of the amount and quality of image material, the Schering Atlas's price is appropriate for institutions, but not for private users.
