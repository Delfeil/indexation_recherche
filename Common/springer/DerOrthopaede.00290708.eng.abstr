About 220 knee endoprostheses are implanted at our clinic annually. This is a routine procedure for the instrument staff. Practice has shown, however, that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments, implants, operating room staff, and surgical planning causes problems. As a result of this, a prophylactic search for sources of error began (risk management). If the sources of error are found, described, and remedied, knee endoprosthetic surgery will be successful for both the patient and the surgical team. Cooperation and communication among manufacturer, surgeon, and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks.
