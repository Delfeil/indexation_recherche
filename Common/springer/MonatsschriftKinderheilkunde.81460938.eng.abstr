Kingella kingae has occasionally been isolated from joint fluid of children with septic  arthritis in europe. K. kingae, a gram- negative bacillus of the Neisseriaceae family, shows a slow fastidious growth in culture. The detection rate can be improved by  inoculation of joint fluid aspirates into  aerobic blood culture bottles and through a longer culture time. K. kingae colonizes the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. However, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis and meningitis have also been described in childhood.
