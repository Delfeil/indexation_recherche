 In contrast to the luminogram of coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has proven to accurately assess both coronary lumen and vessel morphology due to its 360 ° imaging capacity. Directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) improves the coronary lumen by removing plaque mass rather than stretching the vessel and compressing the plaque as with conventional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In an attempt to optimize the procedural result of DCA we prospectively investigated the impact of IVUS guidance in a head to head comparison to on-line quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) on the result of DCA.   In 16 consecutive patients IVUS demonstrated significant residual plaque mass after DCA irrespective of a satisfactory angiographic result. After a mean of 9 +/- 2 cuts luminal improvement was obtained with an area stenosis by angiography of 39 +/- 17% and by IVUS of 50 +/- 10% (p<0.05), a diameter stenosis by angiography of 23 +/- 10% and IVUS of 35 +/- 14% (p<0.05) and finally a minimal lumen diameter (MLD) by angiography of 2.9 +/- 0.5 mm and by IVUS of 2.3 +/- 0.5 mm (p<0.005). After both on-line QCA and IVUS measurements a second series of 7 +/- 2 cuts were initiated to debulk more atheroma and improve stenosis dimensions. After additional cuts IVUS revealed further luminal improvement with an area stenosis by angiography of 25 +/- 16% and IVUS of 21 +/- 18% (n.s.), a diameter stenosis by angiography of 16 +/- 11% and by IVUS of 13 +/- 19% (n.s.) and finally a MLD by angiography of 3.1 +/- 0.5 mm and by IVUS of 2.8 +/- 0.3mm (p<0.05).   Intraprocedual use of IVUS is superior to on-line QCA to assess the immediate result of DCA. IVUS-guided DCA results in more effective atheroma debulking than luminographic evaluation. Results of larger follow-up studies are needed to substantiate the intraprocedural advantage of IVUS with DCA.
