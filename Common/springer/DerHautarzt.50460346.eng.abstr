Linear focal elastosis is the term used to denote asymptomatic, palpable, striae-like lines extending horizontally across the middle and lower back. Histologically these lesions present a focal increase in elastic fibres separating the dermal collagen bundles. To date, this disorder has been described only in male patients, with onset after 60 years of age. A case of linear focal elastosis in a young female patient is presented. In the differential diagnosis the clinical variants of connective tissue naevi, of the elastolyses, and of actinic elastosis are discussed. Considering that this disorder may be merely an unusual form of striae distensae with a distinctive process of "elastotic" regeneration, the term elastotic striae seems appropriate.
