In the last few years microvascular techniques have improved the morphologic and functional results of reconstructive facial surgery. A main advantage is that neuronal rehabilitation can be achieved after tumor surgery. In this study the vascularized thoracic long nerve transplant was used for neuronal reconstruction of the alveolar inferior nerve after resection during tumor surgery. Five patients were examined for recurrence of neuronal function in the mental nerve and lip region after surgery in monthly control intervals. Sensation of pressure and pain was recorded for 3 months, sensation of contact and vibration feeling for 5 months and temperature sensation for 7 months after neuronal reconstruction. Nine months after surgery the mental nerve and lip sensitivity were the same on both sides - the reconstructed and the healthy side - in four patients. Thus, the vascularized thoracic long nerve seems to be a good nerve transplant for bridging defects of the alveolar inferior nerve after resection during tumor surgery.
