Seborrhoic dermatitis is an erythemato-squamous condition of unknown etiology with a prevalence of approximately 2.5%. Frequently difficult to treat, it may respond to the application of low doses of dithranol, a substance which can induce a pustular dermatitis as an adverse side effect depending on the applied concentration and individual susceptibility. We describe a pustular dermatitis after the application of a preparation containing dithranol at an erroneously high concentration in a 30-year-old patient with seborrhoic dermatitis.
