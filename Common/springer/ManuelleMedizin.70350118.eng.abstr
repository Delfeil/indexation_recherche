Disorders of the lower back represent an increasing socioeconomic problem. The widespread use of back supports is recommended as a protective tool but there are some discrepancies regarding the effectiveness of such equipment. In this paper we give information concerning the biomechanical and clinical effects both for occupational physicians and for users of back supports in industry. While an increase in intra-abdominal pressure has been confirmed by different research groups, the deduced hypothesis suggesting a decrease of spinal compression is an object of discussion. In some papers unfavorable effects of back supports on blood pressure, heart rate, and other physiological responses have been discussed. On the other hand, restriction of the range-of-motion seems to cause some protection against extreme movements of the spine. A review of the literature and our own experience permit us to recommend selective use of this device together with other preventive methods.
