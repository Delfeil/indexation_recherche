Abstract.  Introduction: Endovascular therapy of aortic aneurysms is an attractive alternative to conventional aortic surgery. A number of patients, however, will fail endovascular therapy and require open surgical repair. Methods: We report our experience with conversion to open aortic repair. Of 306 patients given endovascular therapy for an infrarenal aortic aneurysm, 30 (9.8 %) required conversion to conventional repair. Results: Thirteen patients (43.3 %) suffered complications, 3 (10 %) of which were fatal. Conversion to open aortic repair after endovascular therapy is technically more demanding than primary open repair, particularly because of clamp techniques and stent-extraction. Conclusions: Emergent conversion operations, especially when preceded by significant retroperitoneal bleeding from vascular tears due to endovascular manipulations are complicated by significant morbidity and mortality.
