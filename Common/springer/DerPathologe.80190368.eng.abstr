The possible relation of acquired cystic kidney disease to renal cell carcinoma resulted in an interdisciplinary concern about this disease. Kidneys from 125 autopsies of dialysis patients were studied. Twenty-four of the patients had tumors. Beside four renal adenocarcinomas and two urothelial carcinomas, incidental small tumor nodules were described in 15.1%. Men had more nodules than women. Patients with nodules had a higher average cyst count, often with multilayered epithelium. There was no difference in age or time of dialysis. This suggests a factor which mediates cyst and tumor proliferation, independent from the time of dialysis.
