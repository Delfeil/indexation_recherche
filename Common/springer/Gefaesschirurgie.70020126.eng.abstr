 A 52-year-old male patient developed a secondary aorto-enteric fistula 33 months after implantation of an infrarenal Dacron tube graft. The correct preoperative diagnosis was established by endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography. After removal of all infected prosthetic material, the intestinal wall was repaired, followed by in situ replacement of a new graft, which was covered by the major omentum. In this report we discuss diagnostic procedures and surgical management of aorto-enteric fistulae, especially in situ replacement and extra-anatomic revascularization.
