Twenty-three patients with class VI atrophy of the maxilla were treated with horseshoe Le Fort I osteotomy. In ten patients, simultaneous placement of the implants was carried out, and in 12 the implantation was done in a second procedure 6-9 months later. A total of 178 implants were placed, and 15 were lost. In one patient, five implants were lost due to an oronasal fistula, leading to loss of part of the bone graft. The implant survival rate for all the implants was 89.0-88.2% in the one-step procedure and 90.0% in the two-step procedure. There was no difference between the one-step and the two-step procedure with respect to the peri-implant soft tissues in follow-up of least 2 years after implantation. We favor the two-step procedure because it allows more precise positioning of implants.
