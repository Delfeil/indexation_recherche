 We report the case of a 39 year old male i. v. drug addict who ingested approximately 50 g of Aspirin in a suicideal attempt. The patient was admitted to our intensive care unit 12 hours after Aspirin ingestion. On admission the patient presented with the clinical signs of a severely depressed mental status (Glasgow-Coma Scale 7) accompanied by the clinical sign of severe hyperventilation. A corresponding respiratory alkalosis was noticed (pH 7.5, pCO2 16.9 mmHg, stand. bicarbonate 18.9 mmol/l, anion gap 14.1). The maximum serum level of salicylate was 1494 mg/l. Immediately gastric lavage with administration of charcoal and cathartics was performed. I. v. sodium bicarbonate and fluids were given. Hemofiltration therapy was performed because of the high serum salicylate concentration and the progressive deterioration of the mental status. After three hemofiltration treatments, the patients mental status improved. Three days after admission, he was transferred to a normal ward from where he was discharged two days later in good condition.
