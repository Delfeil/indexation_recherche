Corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines. As the corneal endothelium may be exposed to endotoxin in organ culture and endotoxin is known to trigger inflammatory reactions, we investigated the effect of endotoxin from E. coli on organ cultured donor corneae with respect to autocrine and paracrine functions and the endothelial viability and density.
