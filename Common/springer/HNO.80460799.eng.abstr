We have reviewed 103 cases of rigid tracheobronchoscopies that were performed in pediatric patients at the ENT University Hospital in Tübingen between 1989 and 1997. In 84% of our patients the indication for en- doscopy was the suspicion of foreign body aspiration, while others were congenital dysplasia in the tracheobronchial tree, tracheomalacia or lesions after long-term intubation. After evaluation of all rigid bronchoscopies in children through age 12, we found that 69% had one or more foreign bodies. Except for one case of a needle, all foreign bodies could be removed by rigid bronchoscopy. There were no serious complications such as bleeding or airway obstruction requiring tracheotomy. At the University Hospital rigid tracheobronchoscopy was found to be an effective and safe procedure. In particular, the procedure should be carried out if the history or clinical findings suggest foreign body aspiration.
