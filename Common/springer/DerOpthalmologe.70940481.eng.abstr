Target: The method of optical coherence tomography (OCT) was investigated regarding its suitability and limits for measuring the cornea and the anterior segment of the eye. Furthermore, the stromal expansion of thermally induced lesions in the cornea directly after irradiation was determined within the scope of the laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK).
