 Ischemic preconditioning (IP), using one or more brief periods of ischemia, each followed by a short reperfusion phase, improves tolerance of subsequent sustained ischemia in different organs. The aim of this experimental study was to evaluate the effects of IP on postischemic function in skeletal muscle. Right hindlimbs of anesthetized rats were pretreated with three cycles each of 10 min of ischemia and 10 min of reperfusion (n = 12). Non-preconditioned animals (n = 12) served as controls. These hindlimbs were then subjected to 3 h of ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion. IP resulted in a significant increase in postischemic skeletal muscle force (240  +/-  47 mN vs 409  +/-  63 mN), force-time integral (1081  +/-  242 mN*s vs 2546  +/-  481 mN*s) and endurance (29.6  +/-  3.4 s vs 48.0  +/-  5.0 s). These data support the potential of IP to reduce postischemic skeletal muscle damage in surgery of the extremities using tourniquet ischemia. The concept deserves clinical evaluation.
