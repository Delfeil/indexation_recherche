Warthin's tumour of the larynx is an unusual finding. In present literature only four cases have been reported. Only one case of a woman suffering from Warthin's tumour of the protid gland and the ipsilateral site of the larynx has been published. A case of a 74-year-old woman with an Warthin's tumour of the right parotid gland and the left false cord is presented. The theories about the development of Warthin's tumours are discussed.
