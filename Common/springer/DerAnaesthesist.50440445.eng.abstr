Although the local anaesthetic prilocaine is less cardio- and neurotoxic than lidocaine, it bears the disadvantage of the formation of methaemoglobin by the metabolite o-toluidine. Prilocaine is often successfully used, especially for the blockade of the brachial plexus, but one problem of this technique is the failure rate of 3-10%, with the consequence that general anaesthesia after administration of prilocaine is frequently necessary. Methaemoglobin formation after prilocaine administration has been thoroughly investigated. Nothing is known, however, about the interactions of prilocaine and the induction of general anaesthesia relative to methaemoglobinaemia.
