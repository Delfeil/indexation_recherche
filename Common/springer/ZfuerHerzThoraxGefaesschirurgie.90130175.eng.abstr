 Aortic valve procedures are generally performed via a median sternotomy. Minimally invasive concepts in cardiac surgery have been developed and alternative procedures for cardiac valve repair/replacement using a partial sternotomy, limited right or left thoracotomy or a transverse sternotomy have been introduced (minimal access techniques). The extracorporeal circulation is established either via this minimal access or via the femoral vessels. We investigated 26 patients undergoing a minimal access procedure for aortic valve repair/replacement using a J-shaped upper partial median sternotomy concerning the procedure-associated morbidity. Reduction in blood loss (range 15-500ml) and reduced transfusion need (range 0-5units/pt) as well as advantages concerning reduction of postoperative pain, pulmonary complications and improved mobilization were found. In the hospital, mortality was 0%. Our preliminary results show that aortic valve repair/replacement using a minimal access technique is a demanding procedure which may reduce perioperative morbidity in selected patients.  The different minimal access techniques in the literature are discussed and compared concerning their characteristic features.
