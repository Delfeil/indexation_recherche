If patients who need electroconvulsive therapy are unable to consent, it is necessary to gain the guardian's permission to carry out the treatment. It remains unclear if, due to possible side effects, it is necessary to gain an additional approval from the Guardianship Court according to § 1904 of German  Civil Code (BGB). The high court of Hamburg (Landgericht Hamburg) decided that legal permission is necessary as a result of the risk of persisting retrograde amnesia and the ensuing danger of permanent damage to the patient's health. This paper points out however, that electroconvulsive therapy, even considering the contraindications, is a safe and effective treatment for depression and schizophrenic psychoses. Application of unilateral short-pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and intensity of cognitive side effects. In particular, retrograde amnesia is very rare with regard to frequency and  intensity and is negligible when compared with the dangers of the illness itself. There- fore, it is not necessary to apply for approval from the Guardianship Court.
