 We present a necrosis of the big toe in a 20-year-old woman with an ingrowing toenail after wedge-shaped excision in the big toe. The reason for the necrosis was a tourniquet that was left in place after the operation. The ischemia, which lasted for 2 days, resulted in subtotal necrosis of the big toe. Six weeks after the operation the patient underwent microsurgical reconstruction. This is a report on the treatment of this complication from the beginning. Early surgical intervention is advocated.
