Introduction. Patients suffering from migraine and tension-type-headache are at risk of misusing analgesics and therefore developing chronic drug-induced headache. The present study compares migraine patients with and without abuse to identify psychological descriptors promoting drug abuse. Methods.  We examined 21 in-patients with migraine and drug-abuse and 21 out-patients with migraine and no drug-abuse who were comparable regarding age and diverse pain variables (intensity, frequency, duration, etc. ). Psychometric questionnaires measured the constructs "pain-", "depression", "self-efficacy" and "pain-coping". Using a standardized interview we investigated the external (environment) and internal (mental factors) conditions of all patients during medication intake.
