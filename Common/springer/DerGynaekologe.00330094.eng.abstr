For diagnostic purposes, the analysis of the pairing behavior of chromosomes during the prophase in the first meiotic division represents an elegant tool to evaluate the origin of male infertility. During the prophase substage, called pachytene meiotic prophase chromosomes comprise axial proteinaceous elements that form synaptonemal complexes in association with homologous chromosomes. These complexes precisely mimic the meiotic bivalents during this critical time of gametogenic differentiation. A surface spreading method of primary spermatocytes is employed to visualize the synaptonemal complexes. This allows an analysis of infertility in carriers of chromosomal aberrations, e. g., Robertsonian translocations, reciprocal translocations, and inversions in respect to its origin. This technique should only be used with prior investigation of mitotic chromosomes. In females, this technique cannot be used for an individual analysis due to the fact that pachytene runs in the fetal stage. Males with impaired reproductive fitness or complete infertility demonstrate diverging behavior, compared with normal germ cell differentiation, in the pairing pattern of homologous chromosomes . In individuals with translocations, an interaction between translocation complexes and sex chromosomes was observed. The data indicate a positive correlation between frequency of association and the degree of germ cell impairment and infertility, respectively. Carriers of inversions appear to be at a severe risk for infertility brought about by spermatogenic disturbance caused by unpaired segments in the affected chromosome and, additionally, by interchromosomal effects. The results demonstrate that especially in respect to IVF, meiotic investigations play a significant role in our effort to detect causes of male infertility.
