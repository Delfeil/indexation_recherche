 This paper reviews respiratory muscle/circulation interaction in congestive heart failure. Respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure - generating capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients. The mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented. Not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients, but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation, such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation. The underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed.
