Thrombembolic events as paraneoplastic complications in malignant disease account for severe morbidity and mortality in these patients. In some cases disturbance in hemostasis is the first manifestation of a neoplastic process. We report the cases of two patients with cerebral and extracerebral vessel occlusions, in whom epithelial tumors of low malignant potential (borderline-tumors) of ovar and peritoneum were diagnosed later on. In one case the removal of the tumor stopped the coagulation problems. The second patient died a few days after the first symptoms with devastating multiple vessel occlusion. In stroke of unknown aetiology a paraneoplastic process should be kept in mind. The diagnosis is more probable with recurrent thrombembolism in different body regions and when warfarin therapie was ineffective. Thoughtful coagulation studies and a tumor search program is recommended in these cases.
