Between 1992 and 1994 two multicentre studies were performed in order to determine the frequency of sensitization to gold salts. In the first study (1992-1993), 872 patients were tested with gold sodium thiosulfate (NTS) 0.25% in Vaseline (V), 0.5% V. and with potassium dicyanoaurate (KDC) 0.002% aqueous solution. 44 patients (5.1%) had a positive patch test reaction to gold salts: 40 (4.6%) to NTS 0.5% V., 20 (2.3%) to NTS 0.25% V. and 5 (0.6%) to KDC. A higher number of positive patch tests to gold salts was noted in patients also sensitized to another metal salt (8.5%) as compared to those who showed no other sensitivities (3.6%).
