Abstract.  The aim of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) is to reduce postoperative complications. In 1994 specialist American companies developed a PAP quality standard, whereby individual recommendations were divided into categories according to the degree of evidence. These recommendations have been tabulated and supplemented with the results of new, randomized, controlled studies.
