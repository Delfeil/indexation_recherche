  An Ivalon-plug (PDA-plug) has been developed for transvenous closure of patent ductus arteriosus. It can be introduced into the ductus through standard venous sheaths with a diameter von 8-16 French. The plug is fixed in its target position by means of four distal (aortal) and two proximal (pulmonary) nitinol struts. In case of malpositioning the system can be pulled back into and retrieved through the sheath. In animal experiments endothelialization of the implanted material was demonstrated. PDA-closure was attempted in 58 patients; the procedure was successful in 57 cases; a residual ductal flow was present in eight patients. During a follow-up of up to 24 months there were no complications.
