Arthroscopy of the knee is only  rarely helpful in determining the cause of patellar pain. This case report gives an example. A 12-year-old boy complained of patellar pain after a soccer match. The pain was misinterpreted as "growing pains" but induced muscular atrophy. A neurological disorder was taken into consideration. Arthroscopy revealed a fibrous, nodular hematoma, which was easy to remove using a Hol : YAG-Laser. The haematoma had developed subsequent to patellar contusion or subluxation. After treatment the boy recovered soon, and muscle atrophy was reversed.
