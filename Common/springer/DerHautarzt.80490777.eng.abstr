The decline of STD in the region of Rostock, Germany, since 1945 is explained by a decreasing incidence of gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis. On the other hand chlamydial and candidal infections have increased. The rate of chlamydia infections was about 45% in our venerological patients, as common as gonorrhea used to be. Genital candidal infections were to be found in 23%. Mycoplasmas were identified in 15%, usually combined with other pathogens except in some cases of vaginitis.
