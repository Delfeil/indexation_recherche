The clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of haematogenous multifocal osteomyelitis, a rare illness, are described. Of clinical note are the pain, pseudoparalyses and restriction of movement. Staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in both of the cases we described. Sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for the localization of subperiosteal abscesses; scintigraphy is a supplementary examination for cases where it is difficult to establish a diagnosis. MR-tomography is the most reliable method for examination of proximal infected foci (spondylitis, pelvis osteomyelitis). In our view, the earliest possible removal of all infected foci by means of operation and parenteral antibiotics mare the most important treatment.
