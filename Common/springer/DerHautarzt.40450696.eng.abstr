Abstract.  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is characterized clinically by the triad of autonomic sympathetic dysfunction, and motor and sensory disturbances of the affected extremity. Typical symptoms are distal generalized edema with cyanotic skin, pathologic function of eccrine sweat glands and diffuse dull pain. If reflex sympathetic dystrophy is not recognized an irreversible stage may be reached, with atrophic pale, cool, and anhidrotic skin, contractures and diffuse osteoporosis. The syndrome can be idiopathic but can also be precipitated by a variety of factors, including banal trauma, bone fracture, and traumatic nerve lesions. Pathophysiologically, a functional disturbance of sympathetic nerve fibres may result in a vicious circle of blood flow dysfunction, excitation of afferent nociceptors and maintenance of sympathetic dysfunction at the level of the spinal or central nervous system. In the patient presented in this paper, sympathetic dysregulation of reflex sympathetic dystrophy was cured by means of blockades of the stellate ganglion.
