In most cases total knee arthroplasty is a powerful tool in the treatment of final stage diseases of this joint. However, some patients complain of postoperative pain, swelling, and loss of range of motion. Noninvasive diagnosis often does not reveal an appropriate cause and is insufficient in terms of treatment. Magentic resonance imaging is not available for technical reasons. Thus, invasive procedures are required. In these cases arthroscopy has proved to be of value. The common causes of postoperative dysfunction are arthrofibrosis, impingement due to soft tissue, patellar instability, infection, loosening and wear, and breakdown of implants. The authors demonstrate and discuss diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities by arthroscopy in respect of the literature.
