Allogenic kidney transplantation is a widely established treatment option for patients wit end-stage renal disease to gain independency from dialysis and recovery off excretory and hormonal functions. Transplantation is superior to dialysis with respect to quality of life, morbidity and mortality. Improements in one-year graft survival have become evident during the last decades, but long-term outcome is not yet satisfying. The most common form of late transplant failure is chronic rejection or chronic allograft nephropathy, and as a consequence of higher ages of transplant recipients death of patients with functioning grafts. The histological hallmark of chronic rejection is intimal thickening of small arteries and arterioles, but the involved pathomechanisms are not well understood. Strict normalization of blood pressure and hyperlipidemia by drugs aims to prevent vascular alterations of chronic allograft nephropathy. In addition, in this overview some other late complications of renal transplant recipients are addressed which are associated to chronic immunosuppression, such as viral or malignant diseases.
