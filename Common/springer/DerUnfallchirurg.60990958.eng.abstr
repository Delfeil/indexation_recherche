A nationwide survey was performed to evaluate the significance of knee replacement (endoprosthesis) in Germany. All orthopaedic, traumatologic and general surgeons were asked about their preferred surgical techniques, favourite types of prosthesis and related issues. Sledge prostheses have been increasingly preferred to constrained prostheses in the last few years. Unicompartmental prostheses as well as constrained prostheses and high tibial osteotomies are still chosen for special cases. Revisions were most commonly due to patella problems. Patella replacement is popular to prevent this problem. Endoprosthetic knee surgery receives as much endorsement among German surgeons as endoprosthetic hip surgery. An important problem is the increasing costs of the method.
