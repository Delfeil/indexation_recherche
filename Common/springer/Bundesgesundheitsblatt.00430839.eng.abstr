With the institution of the Protection against infection Act, case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of notifiable infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in Germany for the first time. Case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease. The abstraction thereby required leads to the creation of nosological entities. The case definitions, which were developed by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to the Protection against infection Act, enable the local health departments to assess and categorise reported cases, deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the RKI via the state health institutions.The quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved, as each reported case/infection will fulfil defined criteria, thereby enabling unclear cases/diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed.
