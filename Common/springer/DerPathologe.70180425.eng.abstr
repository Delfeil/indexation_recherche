Complex mechanisms have evolved in mammalian cells for regulating cellular lifespan. Normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions. In contrast, tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed immortalized. It has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the eukaryotic chromosomes - the telomeres - is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle. The enzyme telomerase adds TTAGGG repeats onto mammalian telomeres, preventing their shortening. Telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells, but detectable in tumor cells. The activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in tumorigenesis in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become immortal. This review describes the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase and their role in cellular senescence and human aging. It summarizes aspects of telomerase in cancer and its function as a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker.
