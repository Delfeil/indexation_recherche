We present the case of a 2-year-old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive scalding of the face. The clinicians raised the suspicion of a physical maltreatment of the child. Because of the morphological findings the medico-legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven. During the criminal proceedings at the appeal court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico-legal expert became obvious. Findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and pouring of water and the influence of clothing in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment. The opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be refuted. During the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an acquittal "in dubio pro reo".
