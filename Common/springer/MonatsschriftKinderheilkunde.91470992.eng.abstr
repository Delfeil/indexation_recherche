The congenital dyserythropoietic anemias represent a group of rare inborn errors with ineffective erythropoiesis as the predominant mechanism of anemia. They are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy. There are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity, cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane. In addition, patients with apparent CDA of heterogenous phenotype are observed, that cannot be attributed to any of the three types. Recently variant genes have been localized to different regions on chromosome 15 or 22. Cases of CDA were reported from many ethnics, in particular in families of meditarranean origin. Many patients load iron necessitating iron depletion. Gallstones are a frequent complication and are observed in childhood or adolescence. Therapeutic measures such as splenectomy, treatment by Interferon  or allogeneic bome marrow transplantation depend on the type and the severity of clinical expression, which shows large variations both within and between affected kindreds.
