Different concepts to improve the clinical utility of prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer detection have been developed. PSA density and transition zone PSA density are not useful screening tools due to a high variability of prostate volume measurement. PSA velocity monitors the change in PSA in a 2-year period, therefore it is not suitable for treatment decisions in men with serum PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml. Measurement of urinary PSA is not helpful for prostate cancer detection.
