 We report 9 patients who where treated for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in our hospital between April 1995 and September 1999. Underlying diseases were acute myelogenous leukemia in 5 patients, acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2 patients and multiple myeloma in 1 patient. Another patient had a history of alcohol abuse. In four cases, the aspergillus infection developed following chemotherapy, in 2 patients in the period of complete remission, and in two others in a state of aplasia. Chest x-ray and computed tomography showed uni- or multifocal pulmonary lesions. In most cases, the diagnosis was establihsed by physical examination, elevated antibody titers, bronchoscopy, and computed tomography of the chest. Antifungal therapy induced partial regression of the aspergillus lesions. For complete treatment, however, surgery was performed. In one patient, indication for surgery was an abscessprone pneumonia which persisted for several weeks despite antibiotic therapy. Intraoperatively, additional wedge resections and lobectomies were necessary. There were no intraoperative complications. In the postoperative period, one patient died from an ARDS syndrome following pulmonary bleeding which required a redothoractomy. Another patient developed a pneumothorax which was treated with a chest tube. There was no evidence for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. One patient could undergo bone marrow transplantation. Another patient died from symptoms related to the underlying malignant disease six months after surgery. Invasive pulmonary asperillosis can be treated successfully by surgical intervention. Indication for lung surgery is unsuccessfull antifungal therapy combined with elevated antibody titers and typical radiological findings or potentially life-threatening pulmonary conditions.
