 First time experienced severe headache combined with fever or meningism requires immediate evaluation by computer tomography (CT) to exclude subarachnoidal or cerebral hemorrhage, hydrocephalus or a tumor. If CT is normal,lumbar puncture must be performed to exclude meningitis and meningoencephalitis. Chronic or chronic recurrent headache without focal neurological deficits does not require EEG or CT. CT must be performed if the headache characteristics change or if the headache is combined with neurological deficits.
