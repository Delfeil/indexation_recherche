Progression of the eukaryotic cell through the cell cycle to induce cell proliferation is a fundamental event in developmental growth processes. Specific cell cycle proteins are critical for either inducing or suppressing the cell cycle. These proteins, therefore, have been found to be key players in regulating cell proliferation in diseases like cancer and atherosclerosis.
