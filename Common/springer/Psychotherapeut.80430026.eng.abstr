It makes sense to give shame a place as a general human emotion seperate from guilt. The defensive function as well as the self preservative function of shame needs to be taken into account. The emergence of shame always points at the preservation of a sense of self worth, even if it is not visible at that moment. Apart from the conscious experience of shame, behaviour equivalent to shame can be seen in children as well as adults. The signal character of shame is discussed as is the question whether symptoms of shame should be seen as signs of illness. Considering the psychogenesis and unconscious dynamics of shame widens the perspective on potentially shaming situations in psychotherapy.
