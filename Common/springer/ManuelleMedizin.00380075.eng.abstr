A topic of manual medicine is the reversible segmental or peripheral articular dysfunction. It is essential to include the musculature when considering the neurophysiological correlation in the functional pathology of the motor system. The Interconnection syndrome and disorders of central control as well as the crossed muscle pattern are expressions of the chronic functional disease of the motor system. We will try to expand upon the examination and treatment of muscle dysbalance of the crossed muscle pattern by using a musclular dysfunction model. In the conclusion we want to unite all of the models mentioned in this 3-part publication into one clear picture.
