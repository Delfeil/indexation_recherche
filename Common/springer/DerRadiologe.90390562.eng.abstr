Carcinoma of the colorectum is one of the most frequent neoplasias, with an incidence of 40 in 100 000. For the effective use of new, differentiated, less invasive treatment options, exact preoperative staging of the tumor is essential. The introduction of endosonography in rectal tumor staging allows for exact differentiation of the rectal wall layers and thus of tumor stages 1-3 with median accuracy of 89%. Magnetic resonance imaging of the rectum, especially in double-contrast technique, can also be employed in high and stenosing tumors and leads to an average accuracy of 85% for the stages 1-4. Computed tomography is the method of choice in screening for metastases. In lymph node staging, all modalities show only moderate accuracy around 75%.
