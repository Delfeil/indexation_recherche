A rare case of well-differentiated syringomatous carcinoma of the nose, at first histologically misdiagnosed as morpheiform basal cell carcinoma, presented as an ulcerated nasal mass. Recurrence of the the tumor and repeated histological examination of tissue specimens led to revision of the primary diagnosis. The histological features of the two entities are compared. The clinician should be aware that knowledge of the biological behavior of this tumor is sparse (based on less than 100 cases) and that the tumor possesses some features of malignancy, requiring a very careful and close follow-up.
