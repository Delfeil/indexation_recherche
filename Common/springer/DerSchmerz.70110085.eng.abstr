Introduction: The present study examines the correlations between pain intensity, mood and pain-alleviating actions in pre-chronic low back pain patients. The three variables were obtained with the Ulm Pain Diary (Ulmer Schmerztagebuch, UST). Methods: Thirty-eight patients with low back pain described pain intensity, effect of pain on mood and medication as well as other therapies over a 3-week period (21 days). The patients had a history of pain for between 6 weeks and 6 months. Clinical and orthopedic examinations revealed no relevant organic findings explaining the pain process. Results: Pain occurred on 18.1 (of 21) days. Half of the patients (n=19) used medication or took other actions against their pain. Correlations between the three variables demonstrated that all three were significantly related. Partial correlations showed in addition to a high correlation between pain intensity and mood, that the frequency of pain-relieving actions was far less related to pain intensity than to mood. The group that took actions against their pain had a higher level of pain intensity than the no-action group. Furthermore, the effect of pain on mood was significantly greater in this group than in the no-action group. Conclusion: The findings indicate that pain intensity, mood and actions against pain are highly correlated. When pain intensity is statistically controlled, the influence of mood on taking medication or other actions against pain becomes more pronounced. It can be concluded that self-initiated actions against pain depend much more on mood than on pain intensity in pre-chronic low back pain patients.
