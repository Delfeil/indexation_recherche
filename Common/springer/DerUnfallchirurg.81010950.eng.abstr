Impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation. Its problematic nature is unfolded on a report of two cases, one with a Küntscher nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail. This event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively. The new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to jam against the cortex. Both, the slot of the unlocked reamed clover leaf nail and the wider dorsal flute of the solid titanium nail, realize certain therapeutic concepts. Their factual benefit within the concept of interlocking nailing is doubtful.
