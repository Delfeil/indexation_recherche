  Providing adequate care of the aged, geriatric caregivers take a key position for the transfer of gerontological knowledge into practice. However, little attention has been focussed on the work conditions and staff distress by gerontologists. The purpose of this paper is to review studies on occupational stress relating to professional geriatric caregivers. Based on relevant research concepts and paradigms, findings of the international literature are summarized. The review shows that occupational stress is affected by a number of work-related factors from behavior problems of the residents to time pressure and organizational deficits. The stress in turn can cause burnout, mental health problems, somatic complaints, and increased turnover. Social support and control at the workplace are supposed to contribute essentially to stress reduction. There are few empirical studies dealing with occupational stress among geriatric caregivers in Germany. Strengths and weaknesses of the studies will be analzyed and suggestions offered for future research in this area. Extending research is needed particularly on the work conditions in the increasing field of geriatric outpatient community services. Inspite of its theoretical and methodological shortcomings, the findings highlight the need for strategies to prevent physical and mental health problems, burnout, and job turnover. It is a challenge for gerontological research to obtain more knowledge on the work-related factors leading to stress as well as to establish effective intervention strategies to reduce its long-term consequences.
