Disorders of sexual function are a frequent sequel to the surgical treatment of tumors in men. Operations involving the abdominal cavity, the retroperitoneal space and the true pelvis can damage the nerve and blood supply of the sexual organs, and this may cause dysfunction of the mechanisms of erection and ejaculation. Since it is often a matter of sexually active patients at the reproductive stage of their lives, the prevention of these secondary effects of tumor therapy takes on a special significance. Impairment of the erection mechanism or disturbances of ejaculation may follow the operative, radiological or medical treatment of a variety of tumors. They are a frequent consequence of the treatment of carcinoma of the bladder, prostate, testes, colon or rectum, and are particularly to be feared after radical operations that can damage the integrity of the nerves and vessels of the pelvis and lumbar region, since these are necessary for the physiological function of the sex organs. Today, with a thorough understanding of the neuroanatomy and with modern surgical techniques, these effects are avoidable in a high percentage of cases. If, however, effective treatment of the neoplasm requires such a radical operation that damage to these nerve pathways cannot be avoided, the consequent reduction of the sexual activity and fertility of patients in this age group can seriously impair the quality of their lives. Even so, there are many therapeutic procedures available which make it possible to treat disturbances both of the erection mechanism and of ejaculation in almost all cases.
