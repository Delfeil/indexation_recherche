Background. The immunocytological detection of disseminated epithelial cells in bone marrow in patients with breast cancer has been performed at many hospitals and institutes since the early 1980s. Despite numerous publications in this field, it has not been possible to standardize the method and  establish the ideal antibody, either nationally or internationally. Molecular biological methods using PCR technology could extend the diagnostic spectrum. However, one of the major problems in breast cancer is the lack of a disease-specific marker gene. As a result, immunocytology is still the standard procedure for tumour cell detection.
