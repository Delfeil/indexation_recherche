 Teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers. The police publish difficult cases of unidentified bodies in dental print media. Using their records such as x-rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification. To evaluate the efficency of this procedure 177 cases published between 1975 and 1995 were examined. The result is unsatisfying. Only 3% of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media. To improve the presentation of identification cases in the dental print media 500 dentists were asked to take part in a survey. According to these results a new concept of presentation sould be developed to improve the efficency of this odontoforensic method. New technological possibilities such as digital x-raying or online data transfer could open new ways for forensic identification.
