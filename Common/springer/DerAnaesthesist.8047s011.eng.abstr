The cardiovascular effects of sevoflurane are similar to those of isoflurane with some minor exceptions. In contrast to isoflurane and particularly to desflurane, sevoflurane has not been associated with increases in heart rate in healthy volunteers and in patients. The coronary vasodilatory potency of sevoflurane appears to be lower than that of isoflurane and it has not been associated with a reduction of blood flow to collateral myocardium in dogs with steal-prone anatomy. In several multi-center studies of patients with coronary artery disease or at high risk for coronary artery disease receiving either sevoflurane or isoflurane for either cardiac or non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of myocardial ischemia and infarction did not differ between treatment groups. In both human and animal models, sevoflurane preserves cerebral blood flow and reduces cerebral metabolic rate, much like isoflurane.
