 According to a part of the health structure reform law which has created fixed rates for certain treatments, all German hospitals were obliged to use the new reimbursement method starting in 1996 at the latest. We have analysed our peripheral bypasses performed in 1995 for differences between the old and new reimbursement method. The new method causes income losses for the hospital of 187,009.05 DM in total and 1,532.86 DM on average per hospital stay. The biggest problem is that most of these income losses are caused by 44 femorocrural vein bypasses, performed for limb salvage. For this sub-group the loss would have been nearly 131,000 DM. If there is no compensation for these income losses, the continuation of bypass surgery at the present level, both in quantity and in quality, is endangered.
