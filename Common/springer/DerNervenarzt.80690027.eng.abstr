In the Berlin Aging Study (BASE) an age and gender stratified sample of 516 persons aged 70 to over 100 was assessed by means of the semi-structured GMS-A interview, the CES-D-self-rating scale and the Hamiltion-Depression-observer-rating scale. Prevalence rates were 4,8% for Major Depression, 9,1% for all DSM III-R specified depressive disorders and 26,9% of subthreshold depression was included. There was no increase in prevalence rates with age but an increase in scores on the self rating CES-D. The prevalence rates for DSM III-R specified depression in females was 10,3% and almost double that of men (5,6%). Depressed persons do not show significant cognitive impairment as measured with the MMSE in comparison to controls. As compared to the total sample higher prevalence rates of overall depression were seen in persons with multimorbidity (36,8%) and lower rates in married persons. 13,2% of the elderly talked about feeling tired with life, 7,9% had thoughts about death and 1,2% reported suicidal ideation, which was closely linked to depressive disorders. In 44% of depressed cases undertreatment was observed. Only 6% got Antidepressants but 40% benzodiazepines.
