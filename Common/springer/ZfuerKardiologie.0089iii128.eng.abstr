 Radiofrequency catheter ablation has established as the first line therapy for the curative treatment of patients with accessory pathways. For left-sided accessory pathways, the retrograde approach over the aortic valve is commonly used for ablation of the ventricular insertion. For right-sided and septal accessory pathways, the atrial insertion is usually approached from the right atrium. Atrioventricular accessory pathways irrespective of the exact localization can be successfully ablated in more than 90-95% of all cases. Severe complications associated with the ablation procedure are rare and occur in approximately 2-3% of patients treated. The recurrence rate after successful ablation is approximately 5-10%. Recurrences of accessory pathway conduction occur almost exclusively within the first 3 months following successful ablation whereas late recurrences are rare.
