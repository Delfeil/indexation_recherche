 The classification of renal insufficiency into stages of full compensation, compensated and decompensated retention and terminal renal failure is of importance if patients with impaired renal function are to undergo elective and emergency surgery. Furthermore, it should be established whether the renal disease is stable or progressive. Preoperatively, particular attention should be paid to problems of fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis as well as to acid-base balance. Many drugs should be avoided altogether in patients with kidney disease.
