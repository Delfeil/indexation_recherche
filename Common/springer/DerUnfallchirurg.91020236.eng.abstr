Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a frequent complication after osteosynthesis of femoral neck fractures. It is rarely seen after proximal femur fractures with intact trochanteric area. The choice of the implant varies from different blade systems (DHS, DCS and condylar plates) to intramedular nailing systems (gamma nail, classic nail). The complication of avascular necrosis of the femoral head after internal fixation of subtrochanteric and proximal femur fractures is reported following intramedullary nailing. We report a case of a femoral head necrosis after osteosynthesis of a proximal femur fracture with a 95 degree condylar plate.
