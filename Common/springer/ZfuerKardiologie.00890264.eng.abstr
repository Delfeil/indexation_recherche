 Since the discovery of renin by Tigerstedt and Bergmann, the renin angiotensin system (RAS) has been recognized as an important modulator of blood pressure and volume homeostasis. Based on these functions a pathophysiological role of the RAS in the pathogenesis of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders has been postulated. The therapeutic benefit of RAS inhibition by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensinII (ANGII) antagonists in these conditions has been shown. It remains unclear, however, whether the changes in RAS activity associated with cardiovascular disease are primary or secondary factors. It is well known that hypertension and hypertensive end-organ disease is influenced by genetic factors. Gene polymorphisms for virtually all components of the RAS have been described and investigated in clinical studies. It remains to be determined, however, how relevant these findings are for disease etiology. This review, therefore, will attempt to discuss the causal implications of these genetic studies for cardiovascular disease. The role of angiotensinogen and ACE for hypertension, coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders is discussed in this context in an exemplary fashion.
