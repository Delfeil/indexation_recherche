Since transmission of HIV through allogenic bone grafts has been established, the concept of cryopreservation of allogenic bone had to be reconsidered. The strict guidlines of the scientific board of the Bundesärztekammer of 1990 are very labour-, time- and money-intensive. We have therefore moved to autoclaving allogenic cancellous bone. This is harvested from femoral heads during THR in slices of 2 to 3 mm, then cleaned under non-sterile conditions with a hard water jet followed by an ultrasonic bath for approx. 20 minutes. The slices are then double sealed individually and autoclaved at a temperature of 134  °C and a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres. Storage is in sealable containers at room temperature, so the material available at any time. Since the bone tissue has been freed of most organic matter and therefore lost its bone-specific antigenic structure, all that is left is the anorganic component with its inimitable architecture. This treatment results in a cancellous bone graft which is sterile, biocompatible and osteoconductive. Biologically it is inferior to autogenic and cryopreserved bone. Experimental and clinical studies show, however, that autoclaved cancellous bone can be a suitable substitute in well-selected indications. To elucidate the ultrastructural changes of the spongiosa and proteins induced by autoclaving further investigations are necessary. For example, the specific proteins involved need to be determined.
