The authors present a rare case of solitary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the skull of an 11-year-old girl. The clinical, radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report. The morphological features of intra- and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging. Although rare, NHL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children.
