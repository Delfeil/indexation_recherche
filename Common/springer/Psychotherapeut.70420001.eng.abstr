Whilst the first part of the review about the relevance of attachment theory covered the basic principles and methods of attachment research, this second part deals with possible implications of the theory within the field of psychotherapy and psychosomatics. Consideration of its general clinical relevance and of the relationship between attachment theory and psychoanalysis forms the basis for a description of the usefulness results of attachment research might have in psychotherapeutic practice. Summaries of studies dealing with the importance of attachment characteristics for the development of psychosomatic disorders and for coping with illness and stress and studies combining attachment styles with psychopathology will follow. The last part of the review refers to the importance of the theory for psychotherapy and psychotherapy research.
