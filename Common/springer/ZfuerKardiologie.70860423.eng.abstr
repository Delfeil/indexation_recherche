  Although carditis associated with Mycoplasma pneomoniae is infrequent it is an important cause of death in M. pneumoniae infections. We report on a 4-year-old boy with a M. pneumoniae infection, who developed a large hemorrhagic perocardial effusion and was successfully treated by percutaneous catheter drainage. Except in cancer patients, nontraumatic hemorrhagic pericardial effusions are rare. Our case strongly supports direct bacterial invasion into perocardial tissue as a cause of M. pneumoniae pericarditis rather than autoimmune phenomenon.
