Mechanisms in the lesioned muscle: The peripheral mechanism underlying the tenderness and pain during movement of a damaged muscle is the sensitization of muscle nociceptors. Ongoing activity of nociceptors causes spontaneous pain in addition to tenderness. Muscle pain (particularly that originating in myofascial trigger points) is often mislocalized because it is referred to other deep somatic tissues. The development of trigger points is a purely peripheral event, whereas the referral of muscle pain is based on central nervous mechanisms.
