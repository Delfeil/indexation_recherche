 Severe pulmonary hemorrhage (hemoptysis) is a life-threatening condition, despite the recent development of intensive care management (6). Considering different definitions, an amount of 1000ml/24h or 150ml/h is regarded as severe hemoptysis (13). In recent years we have seen a change in predisposing factors, with an inflammatory disorder being the cause of 90% of all nontraumatic cases (5,9). Patient with severe valvular dysfunction, especially mitral stenosis, ravel suffer from hemoptysis. Following thrombolytic therapy hemoptysis as a severe complication is seen in only 0.4% (2). We now report on a patient who had several frustrane thrombolytic therapies for Re-Re-Rethrombosis of his mechanical prosthetic mitral valve and experienced massive hemoptysis during emergency mitral valve replacement. Rinsing the patient's bronchial tree with ice-cooled isotonic saline and epinephrine, positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation and local bronchial tamponade with epinephrine soaked gauze swabs, left the patient's pulmonary bleeding unabated. Therefore we decided to transform the cardiopulmonary bypass into a thoracic arterio-venous ECMO/ECCO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and -CO2 elimination) and thereafter performed a tamponade of the whole tracheo-bronchial tree with epinephrine soaked swabs. With this treatment the patient's hemoptysis finally seized and successive removal of the bronchial tamponade became feasible. Subsequently we resumed mechanical ventilation and the ECMO was successfully explanted. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a successful treatment of severe pulmonary hemorrhage with a lung assist system (LAS).
