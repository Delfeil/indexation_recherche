Recently, Zenner et al. implanted the first totally implantable electronic hearing devices in patients with SNHL (HNO 46 [1998] 844-852). In the present report, technical and audiological features of the implant TICA are published. The development of the piezoelectric transducer and the microphone for implantation in the posterior wall of the auditory canal as components for the present fully implantable hearing system has already been described (HNO 45, 1997, 792-880). Here we report about our experience with the electronic main module that completes the TICA LZ 3001 system. This module is suited for implantation in the mastoid bone and contains the signal-processing electronics and an integrated battery that can be recharged transcutaneously with a portable charger. The recharging time is around 2 h for an implant operating time of 50h. The microphone and transducer connectors allow for easy replacement of the main module when the battery lifetime is reached. This lifetime is around 3-5 years. A small wireless remote control allows volume adjustment, contains an on/off switch, and permits selection of four different individual hearing programs. The basic audiological features are provided by a flexible, digitally programmable 3-channel-AGC-system with a peak clipping function. The total bandwidth is around 10 kHz. To our knowledge this is the first fully implantable hearing system that has been in implanted in humans.
