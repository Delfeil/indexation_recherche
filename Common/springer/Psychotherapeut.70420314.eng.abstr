Psychotherapists live in a conflicting area between the image of a family ideal and family reality which is marked by actual and previous experiences. The role and function in one's own family of origin quite often influence the choice of profession and personal life career. Although the psychotherapeutic profession leaves much scope to find a compromise between professional and family life it is not as easy for female psychotherapists to realize a family model which equally fits for both spouses. Three kinds of family models are presented. Furthermore, the positive and negative implications of the psychotherapeutic profession on the marital and family relationships are discussed. Psychotherapists should pay attention to their personal relationships as much as to the therapeutic relationship of their patients during their professional training.
