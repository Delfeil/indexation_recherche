 At present there is a noticable trend in the literature and clinical practise that different medical specialities prefer various procedures of tracheostomy in intensive care medicine rather onesided and without consensus of opinion. In result of effective cooperation between ENT department and surgical and medical intensive care units in planning and realization, there were 239 tracheostomies of different techniques performed; due to these experiences clear indications for the varying methods became obvious. The indications are based on both the history of present illness and its course and the contraindications of percutaneous tracheostomy methods. In comparison of 3147 conventional surgical and 2124 percutaneous tracheostomies the perioperative complication rate is almost indentical. Therefore, it seems impossible to draw a conclusion in favor of one method at present time.
