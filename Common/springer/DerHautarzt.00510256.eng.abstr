Both herpes simplex and herpes zoster are not uncommon in patients affected by malignant lymphoma or leukemia. Of particular interest, the herpetic lesions may be followed by specific cutaneous infiltrates. We report on a patient with a centrocytic-centroblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma who showed primary skin infiltrates within the area affected by herpes simplex. After effective therapy with aciclovir, papules and plaques developed at the site of the herpetic scars. Histologic investigation confirmed dense B-lymphocytic infiltrates with immunoglobulin light chain restriction and a granulomatous reaction. Although the chemotherapeutical regiment was modified, the patient died one month later of a lethal blast crisis. The occurrence of so called isotopic skin reactions and their prognostic significance is discussed.
