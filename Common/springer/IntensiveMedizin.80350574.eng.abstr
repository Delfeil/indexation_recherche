 Cytokines and their endogenous antagonists are released from inflammatory cells during acute pancreatitis. The role of cytokines in the initiation of acute pancreatitis has been examined in animal models but also in patients using the post-ERP pancreatitis model. Cytokine release was followed by an anti-cytokine release. Serum levels of cytokines correlate well with the severity of the pancreatitis and may be useful as prognostic parameters. However, clinical scores as well as PMN elastase are established in determining prognosis. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 or soluble antagonists/receptors of IL-1 und TNF- may be promising mediators in the treatment of acute pancreatitis as demonstrated in animal experiments. However, clinical trials are necessary to confirm these promising anticytocine therapeutic strategies.
