Multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem. The present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged 65 years or more. A total of 1154 multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS) of at least 18 points were divided in two age groups: Y: 16 - 64 years, n = 1022; O: 65 - 94 years, n = 132. Older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases (69%), while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers (41%). ISS was comparable in both groups (Y 28 +/- 1, O 27 +/- 1). During ICU-therapy incidence of ARDS (Y 10%, O 11%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF; Y 6%, O 9%) and pneumonia (Y 17%, O 21%) were comparable. In contrast, septic complications were more frequent in older patients (Y 19%, O 27%). Length of ICU stay (Y 19 +/- 2, O 18 +/- 1) and ventilation time (Y 14 +/- 2, O 17 +/- 1) were comparable. Mortality was significantly higher in older patients (Y 15%, O 53%). The major cause of death was sepsis in older patients (Y 15%, O 31%) and MOF in younger patients (Y 54%, O 29%). In conclusion, older trauma patients had a higher mortality due to the development of septical complications.
