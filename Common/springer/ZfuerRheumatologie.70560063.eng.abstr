 Despite commonly applied clinical criteria, the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often remains difficult, thus delaying on suitable early treatment. In search for a test furthering the early and reliable diagnosis of RA, we have screened for novel disease specific autoantibodies. To this end proteins were isolated from synovial membranes and other tissues following a special protein purification protocol, and these were separated electrophoretically. Western blots were then used to screen sera of RA patients and of individuals suffering from other rheumatic diseases for antibodies to any of these proteins.
