Especially after prolonged antibiotic ototopic therapy otomycosis is not rare. An inoculation of fungi into the tympanic cavity however may have serious sequelae. Therefore an eradication of fungi from the external auditory canal is imperative before surgery. In addition to thorough cleaning of the outer ear canal antimycotic preparations are recommended in treating otomycosis. However, all of the commercially available ear drops contain ototoxic agents. In the case of defects of the tympanic membrane a damage of the inner ear may result. Alternatively, we suggest an aqueous solution of Miconazol 0,5%.
