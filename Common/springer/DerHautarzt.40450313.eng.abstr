 We report on three family members suffering from both autosomal dominant Hailey-Hailey disease and bipolar affective disorder. As molecular biology techniques have made the localization of genes causing simple Mendelian traits possible as a routine task, the gene for Hailey-Hailey disease will presumably be localized in the foreseeable future. The Hailey-Hailey gene and its chromosomal surrounding will then be a region of interest for linkage studies in bipolar affective disorder.
