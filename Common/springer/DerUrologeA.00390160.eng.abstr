Purpose: The pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex, but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear. The cerebral cortex is involved in coordinating micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions. The present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by EEG power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned. We also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation (IVES) therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity.
