S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum concentrations serve as markers of cerebral damage in cardiac surgery, neurology, or after head injury. In these circumstances, S-100 and NSE levels correspond with the results of neuropsychological tests. The present study investigated the diagnostic value in orthopaedic patients after joint replacement.
