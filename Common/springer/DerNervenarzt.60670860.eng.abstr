A total of 126 patients (63 female, 63 male) underwent microsurgical removal of their cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) by the same surgeon. The mean age at surgery was 34.7 (6-72) years. The symptoms were intracerebral hemorrhage (37.3 %), seizure disorder (34.9 %) or focal neurological deficits and minor symptoms. According to the Spetzler/Martin scale, 20.6 % of the AVMs were grade I, 28.6 % grade II, 32.5 % grade III, 14.3 % grade IV and 4 % grade V. In all, 78 AVMs (61.9 %) were located in functionally important brain regions. The series was split into three different groups: small AVMs under 3 cm in diameter (n = 62/49.2 %), medium-sized AVMs (n = 58/46 %) and large AVMs (n = 6/4.8 %). Seventeen patients had preoperative embolization of their AVM. All patients had postoperative angiographic control and 3- and 6-month follow-up. One patient died (0.8 %), and another one (0.8 %), in whom the AVM was incompletely resected, suffered a secondary hemorrhage. Seventeen (27.4 %) of the patients with small AVMs developed transient neurological worsening postoperatively, which remained permanently significant in 3.2 %. The respective numbers for the patients with medium-sized AVMs were 48.3 % and 10.3 % and for the large AVMs 83.3 % and 33.3 %. The results of microsurgical removal of cerebral AVMs can still be considered superior to the results of stereotactic radiosurgical treatment available from the literature - even for small AVMs. This is due to immediate exclusion of the AVM under direct local control of the angioarchitecture and thereby a reduced risk of secondary hemorrhaging and a decreasing morbidity rate with increasing time after the operation. Radiosurgical treatment requires a 2-year latency period for obliteration and carries a mortality rate of up to 12.5 % and a rate of unexpected side effects of up to 20 %. This treatment should be reserved for small, deep, surgically inaccessible AVMs or used as part of a multimodality treatment regimen consisting of partial embolization, partial excision and consecutive radiation of the residual nidus in initially very large AVMs. Embolization therapy - such as radiosurgery - carries a significant risk of morbidity (8 %) and a mortality rate of up to 6 %. It should only be considered for AVMs that are expected to be fully obliterated afterwards, or for primary inoperable AVMs that are to be changed into operable ones by embolization. Size reduction of otherwise operable AVMs does not justify the additional risk of embolization. Close collaboration of the specialities involved is desirable.
