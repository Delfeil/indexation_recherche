An example of a benign haemorrhagic spindle cell tumour of the lymph node (synonym: intranodal myofibroblastoma) is presented, which was first described 5 years ago and has not as yet been documented in the German literature. This rare benign mesenchymal neoplasm of the lymph node occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region. Diagnostic criteria include its composition of myofibroblastic cells (with immunoreactivity for vimentin and actin), which may show nuclear palisading, the presence of peripheral haemorrhage zones and the occurrence of characteristic amianthoid structures, which have the ultrastructural appearance of dense meshworks of collagen fibers. Knowledge of this tumour entity is important for differential diagnosis of primary and secondary malignant mesenchymal neoplasias of the lymph node.
