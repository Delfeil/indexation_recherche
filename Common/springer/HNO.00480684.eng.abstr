Angiosarcomas are very rare but highly malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the vascular endothelium. The tumor is most commonly found in the skin. The cancer is known to cause early and widespread metastases leading to a very poor prognosis of less than 24 months. The therapy of choice is radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation.
