  25 patients in every group (steel bands versus stainless steel wires) undergoing open heart surgery that involved median sternotomy were evaluated in a prospective randomized study. The average age of the patients and the risk factors predisposing to dehiscence were similar in both groups. In this study we looked for the problems of intraoperative handling, postoperative data and clinical follow up.
