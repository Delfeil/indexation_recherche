Incisional hernias are a common complication following abdominal surgery. Surgical treatment as a whole has the disadvantage of having a high recurrence rate. Far better results are obtained by tension-free closure, if necessary backed up by a synthetic prosthesis (PTFE, polypropylene). However, even then, a recurrence rate of about 10 % can be expected.
