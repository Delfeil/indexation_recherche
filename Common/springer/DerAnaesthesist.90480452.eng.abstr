Systemic air embolism is a dramatic event frequently resulting in death. The clinical manifestations are polymorphic and unspecific. We report a case of a systemic air embolism in a patient with lung contusion. We wish to arouse a sensibility for this clinical picture, which seems to be underestimated in its frequency and importance, and discuss concepts of mechanical ventilation in patients with blunt thoracic trauma.
