The pathogenetic mechanisms of acute cochleo-vestibular lesions are still unknown, but viral infections and vascular phenomena with impairment of microvascular perfusion are thought to play a major role. Between 1 July, 1986 and 28 February 1998, 1501 patients were treated with an infusion protocol using cortisone, dextrane 40 and pentoxifylline. Group 1 contained 1001 patients with sudden hearing loss, group 2a 107 patients with isolated tinnitus and group 2b 393 patients with labyrinthine disorders (among which were 81 patients with cochleovestibular dysfunction). The records were evaluated retrospectively. In group 1 complete hearing recovery occurred in 44.8%, partially in 40.4%, no change in 12.1% and worsened in 2.6%. In group 2a with isolated tinnitus 17.9% had a complete recovery, 43.9% partial recovery, 35.5% no change and 2.8% worsened symptoms. In group 2b vertigo disappeared in 56.8%, had partial recovery in 21.0% and did not change in 7.4%. In the 1501 patients treated, no significant side-effects were found to the medical interventions used. From these results we conclude that the infusion protocol is safe and effective in the treatment of cochleo-vestibular disorders.
