Abstract  In the following, the advantages of the ultracision (UC) over conventional surgical technique are described. A total of 40 applications in vascular surgery are analyzed (aortic aneurysms, ileofemoral or femoropopliteal reconstruction, lymphatic fistula) after gaining experience in minimally invasive and open visceral surgery. Preparation with UC was accomplished better than by conventional technique. The postoperative follow-up did not reveal any complications. Preparation with UC reduces tissue damage and combines different techniques into one step (cutting, coagulation, coaptation, cavitation).
