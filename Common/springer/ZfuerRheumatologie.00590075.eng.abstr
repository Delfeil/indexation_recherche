 The discovery of the suprarenal glands and their function is discussed. The complicated history of cortisone from the synthesis until its use as an antirheumatic is told. Pharmacotherapy with this physiologic hormone also caused serious side effects. Changing the molecular structure did not essentially solve this problem.

Modern standards for corticoid therapy of rheumatoid arthritis are discussed. The important problem of corticoid osteoporosis and the myth of cortisone ulcers are also explained.
