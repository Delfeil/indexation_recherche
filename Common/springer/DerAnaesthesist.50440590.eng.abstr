Epidemiologic studies have shown that trace concentrations of inhalation anaesthetics polluting the air of operating theatres could have deleterious effects on the personnel's health. Nitrous oxide (N2O) oxidises vitamin B12 and thus decreases DNA production by inactivation of methionine synthase. Therefore, the United States and most European health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks. These values range from 25 to 100 ppm, expressed as time-weighted averages (TWA). There is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions. The aim of this study was to quantify levels of N2O in a recovery room (RR) with an air conditioning system.
