In the winter semester 1998/1999 the course of legal medicine included 26 h of obligatory teaching. The course consists of several seminars of 2 h and an accompanying lecture. The contents of the seminars included a practical execution of an external post-mortem examination, participation at an autopsy with recording of the findings and subsequent discussion, legal aspects of the medical profession as well as clinical-forensic opinions on injuries. The acceptance of the curriculum could be verified by a questionnaire filled out by the students. Of the 361 students, 72% participated in the survey. The course was graded with an average of 1.7 on an scale of 1-6. The answers on the structure and content of lectures were graded on a scale from 1 (not relevant) to 7 (relevant). The logical construction, organisation, presentation and interest value of the topics were graded with an average of 6 points. A continual evaluation is also planned for subsequent semesters.
