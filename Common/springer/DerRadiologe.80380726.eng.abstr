Comparison of radiation exposure applied by different types of CT scanners for the investigation of the chest and abdomen. Determination of radiation exposure applied by multi-phase spiral CT. Estimation of the dose in air in the system axis of the scanner, the CT dose index (CTDI) and the effective dose for electron beam tomography (EBT) and two conventional CT scanners (sequence, SEQ; spiral, SCT). For EBT, dose in system axis for investigation of the abdomen was above 50 mGy. Effective dose for investigation of the chest and abdomen was higher with EBT (11 and 26 mSv, respectively) than with conventional CT (SEQ, 4 and 20 mSv; SCT, 2 and 7 mSv). The effective dose for a biphasic investigation (liver 5 mSv, kidney 4 mSv) was below, for a triphasic investigation (liver 7 mSv) above the effective dose of the investigastion of the abdomen (6 mSv). Investigation of the abdomen with the EBT should only be performed for certain indications. With spiral CT, effective dose is much lower than with EBT.
