 Electronic monitoring encloses the DP-assisted observation of leads, the recording, processing and storage of vital functional data. The clinical requirements for the practical monitoring and applicable methods are being briefly described as well as the basics of data processing. A general concept is described only for basic monitoring. It should include the ECG, heart rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry), respiratory rate, body temperature and non-invasive blood pressure control. The direct control of the arterial pressure should be employed generously. Other monitoring methods are being reserved for special indications, pulmonalis catheters and the tonometry of the gastric fluid can be employed for a relatively short period and are therefore not always described under the term of continuous monitoring.
