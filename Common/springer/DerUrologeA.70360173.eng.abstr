We report our preliminary results using a new magnetic resonance imaging technique for visualization of the urinary tract. Using the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), we were able to obtain images of the urinary tract comparable to those obtained by conventional excretory urography. The major advantage of our technique is that besides good morphologic visualization, the excretion of gadolinium-DTPA can be studied simultaneously. We demonstrate our preliminary results in selected cases.
