 Oncological emergencies are life-threatening events that are directly or indirectly related to a malignancy. They are caused by compression of organs, metabolic imbalances or therapy-related adverse events. The latter can be minimized by modern means of supportive care. In case of emergency in tumor patients, differential diagnosis should always include non-tumor related causes (e. g. cardiac infarction). Oncological emergencies should always be treated in an intensive care unit if there is a curative treatment option. Intensive care of an emergency during palliative oncological treatment has to be throughly weighed against the disadvantages. Abolishing an oncological emergency in a terminally ill patient will only lead to other complications. There is, for example, no justification for dialysis in a uremic patient with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
