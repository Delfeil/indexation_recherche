 Acute cardiac ischemic syndromes represent a continuous spectrum of disease with the same underlying cause: rupture or fissuring of a stable atheromatous plaque to form an unstable lesion with superimposed thrombus formation. Angioscopic findings show that in patients with unstable angina the thrombus is white or gray and probably consists mostly of platelets. Platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation are central to the pathophysiology of unstable angina. Pharmacological antagonism of this process is thus an attractive strategy for antithrombotic therapy. Aspirin, Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to decrease the frequency of clinical events. However these drugs provide only partial inhibition of platelet aggregation and they do not inhibit the stimulation of platelet aggregation by agonists such as thrombin. Inhibition of the final common pathway of platelet aggregation, with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor as a target, offers a logical method of achieving greater control of platelet function. Several inhibitors of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors have been evaluated for use in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty and in those with unstable angina. This article will review the results of clinical trials evaluating the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the settings of PTCA and unstable angina, and provide a critical discussion on the role of this new class of drugs in the management of patients with ischemic coronary syndromes.
