Certain intra-articular fractures of the knee can be managed by arthroscopically assisted reduction and  fixation. The known benefits of arthroscopy include better visualization of the entire joint, limited dissection, and thorough irrigation. The purpose of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of certain intra-articular fractures of the knee. From May 1995 to November 1997, 34 patients with intra-articular fractures of the knee were treated by arthroscopic reduction and fixation. We treated 11 patients with tibial plateau fracture type I, II and III (according to J. Schatzker classification), 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (intercondylar eminence) type II, III and IV (according to Meyers, McKeever and Zariczny classification), two patients with completely dislocated osteochondral flake fractures of the femoral condyle, and one patient with a minimally displaced fracture of the patella. Postoperatively they were all allowed passive motion exercises. Patients with avulsion fractures of the ACL and the patient with fracture of the patella were allowed immediate weight bearing, while patients with tibial plateau fractures and osteochondral fractures were allowed weight bearing only after 12 weeks. Results: Of the 11 tibial plateau fractures, 8 were anatomically reduced, and in 2 the dislocation was less than 2 mm. No further dislocation of the fragment followed. All patients but one reported stable knees and they all had a full range of motion at follow-up. Of the 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament, 19 were anatomically reduced. Except in one patient, functional results were excellent (KT1000 was 1.3 mm, average loss of flexion was 2.5 °, loss of extension was 1.3 °). In two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle, reduction was anatomical. The fractures healed, the patients were free of pain and had full ROM at the follow-up. The fracture of the patella healed in 4 weeks with full ROM of the knee. There was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications. Conclusions: Arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra-articular fractures of the knee. Provided indications are good, results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy. There is less postoperative morbidity, and hospitalization and total rehabilitation times are shorter. Some technical hints are presented.
