In a prospective study of central fractures of the talus, radiological data (plain radiography, CT, MRI) were scrutinized in terms of correlation with histological findings (biopsy taken at time of screw removal). The study looked at nine fractures in eight patients aged 14 - 48 years. There was one fracture of Hawkins type I, one fracture of type II, four fractures of type III, and three corpus fractures. All were operated on within 24 h after injury; seven had screw fixation, two had adaptation with K wires. The patients were kept non-weight-bearing for 14 - 53 weeks. Duration of follow-up was 2 years or more in all but one patient. In the final radiograph the talus was intact in four patients, while four showed a partial avascular collapse; in one patient, a partial collapse was doubtful. Histology taken 16 - 52 weeks after injury showed osteocyte-free original bone in all cases, with deposition of new bone varying in extent. Hawkins sign was partially positive in six patients, positive in one, and negative in one. Decalcification as well as fracture healing can be better followed by CT than by plain radiography. MRI appeared normal in five patients, partially pathological in two, and abnormal in one. A positive Hawkins sign and normal signal behavior can be seen as prognostically favorable signs. However, in the case of a central talus fracture, even with a favorable course osteonecrosis of at least a part of the talus with gradual replacement by new bone occurred. Vascularization of the central talus seems to be disturbed more frequently than is reflected radiologically.
