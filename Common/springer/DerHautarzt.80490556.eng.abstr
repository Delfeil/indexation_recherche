The closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying, if a free transplant is necessary. Following the technique of Tillmann described first in 1908, several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined. We report on 14 patients (ages 41-88 years) where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors (5 melanomas, 5 basal cell carcinomas, 1 keratoacanthoma, 1 trichilemmal cyst, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 skin metastasis) were successfully closed by this method. The diameter of the defect ranged between 4 and 8 cm (mean 5,7 cm). Size and number of the rotating flaps (3 or 4) was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue. The procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases. Wound healing occurred without complications except in 3 cases. 2 patients (63 years, 70 years) developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps. In a 74 year old man with a very large defect of 8 cm diameter, one flap of four underwent total necrosis. The cosmetic result was rated "very good" in 71,4% and "good" in 14,3%. The preservation of the terminal hair turned out to be of special advantage. The "windmill procedure" is an important addition to the surgical approaches for closure of large defects on the scalp, particularly in young patients.
