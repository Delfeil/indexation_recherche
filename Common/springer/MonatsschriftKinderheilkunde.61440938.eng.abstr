 Acute respiratory symptoms in the immunocompromised child represent an important diagnostic challenge for the clinician. An early and precise diagnosis leads to prompt institution of effective therapy and avoidance of unnecessary and potentially harmful therapy. Infections with a vast variety of microorganisms have to be considered beyond the common bacteria, Pneumocystis carinii, cytomegaly virus, fungi, mycobacteria and respiratory viruses beeing most important. However, in 25-30 % of immunocompromised children respiratory symptoms are of non-infectious origin. For diagnosis anamnestic data, chest radiograph and blood investigations are of limited value. Most informative is the analysis of airway secretions: nasopharyngeal secretion, sputum (spontaneous or induced) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is diagnostic in 60-80 %, the remaining cases have to undergo lung biopsy procedures, depending on the severity of illness.
