Within inpatient psychotherapy traditionally different therapeutic approaches are combined. Usually verbal interventions of different orientations and settings (e.g. individual and group therapy), nonverbal procedures (e.g. music and art therapy) and bodyoriented techniques are included. The combinations is merely additive, integrated or eclectic. Little is known about the reciprocal interrelation of such combinations. Along the example of a definite additive combination of psychodynamic and behavioural psychotherapy for agoraphobias and obsessive disorders a rationale for the interrelationship of the different therapeutic components is discussed.
