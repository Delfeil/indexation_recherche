The development of minimally invasive and arthroscopic techniques as well as early rehabilitation has brought a significant increase in the functional outcome of joint mobility following knee surgery. Despite this fact, surgeons are still being confronted with an increasing number of knee operations in patients suffering from limited knee motion or arthrofibrosis. Several surgical techniques to improve knee mobility can be performed, depending on the amount and characteristics of immobility. Indications for arthoscopic or open surgery should be based on an algorhithm. The goal of this paper is to present this algorhithm and discuss the limitations of arthroscopic procedures. In seven patients with an average range of motion of 42.8 ° preoperatively, an open procedure had to be performed. The average range of motion intraoperatively was 115 ° and 97.8 ° at follow-up after 22.4 months.
