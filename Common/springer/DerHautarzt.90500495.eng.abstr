In 1990, we first described the papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS). It is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever. The skin  lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days. In more than half of the patients, an acute parvovirus B 19 infection has been proven. In a few cases of PPGSS, other viral infections have been found, for example hepatitis B and measles. We report on a patient with PPGSS and review the literature.
