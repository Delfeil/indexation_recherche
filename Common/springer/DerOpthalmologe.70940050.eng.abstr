Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) is commonly used in patients with myocardial infarction. Recently, it has also been applied intraocularly to dissolve post-operative fibrin with no serious complications being reported so far. In this study we describe our own experience with rTPA in 25 patients with persisting fibrinous membranes in the anterior segment. rTPA (Actilyse, Dr. Karl Thomae GmbH) was given in a single dose of 25 µg and injected into the anterior chamber via a paracentesis. We did not encounter any complications during the injection of rTPA. In 21 eyes fibrin could be reduced significantly, albeit sometimes only slowly. In 13 patients, the membrane had dissolved almost completely by the following day. In contrast, no success was observed after glaucoma surgery (2 eyes) and in chronic iritis (1 eye), or when fibrin mixed with blood was treated (1 eye). There were two (controllable) post-operative hemorrhages (rTPA after vitrectomy, and for fibrin/blood after cataract surgery). In addition, we noted 2 cases of irreversible superficial corneal clouding (rTPA after cataract surgery). We conclude that injection of rTPA can be a useful addition to steroid treatment in selective cases of persisting fibrin in the anterior segment. Long-standing membranes, however, are unlikely to be dissolved. Care should also be taken and rTPA be avoided when there is evidence of recent bleeding. Most worrying to us were the corneal complications that we cannot explain to date. With regard to the definite time correlation we feel that rTPA or one of the solution components might be the cause of this unusual feature.
