Sarcoidosis is characterised by the formation of sarcoidal granulomas in all affected organs. Despite intensive research, the cause of the disease in unknown. There are only a few reports suggesting an induction of sarcoidosis by interferons. Three patients are presented in whom sarcoidosis developed during or after interferon alpha therapy. The probability of interferon therapy as cause of sarcoidosis is discussed.
