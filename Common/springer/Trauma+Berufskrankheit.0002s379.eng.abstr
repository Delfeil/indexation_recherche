Intraarticular fractures of the base of the first metacarpal that have healed in displaced position quickly lead to posttraumatic arthritis. After satisfactory closed reduction a percutaneous pin fixation is sufficient, if necessary combined with fixation of the first metacarpal. If closed reduction cannot be obtained, open reduction with pin fixation, or rigid fixation with screws or plates, is advisable. Displaced fractures of the metacarpal base of the fingers also lead to posttraumatic arthritis with a weak grip. Displaced fractures and dislocated fractures require reduction and percutaneous or internal fixation with K-wires and possibly additional pin fixation of the carpometacarpal joints.
