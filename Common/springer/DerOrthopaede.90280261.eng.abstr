In the following report we give a definition of the terms nomenclature and classification. We find out, that the two terms are very similar. They include the keys for diagnosis and therapy. We propose a method to construct new coding-systems. Furthermore we report about the existing coding-systems in Orthopaedics and Traumatology. We cite a list of national and international coding-systems. Because of the actuality we finally give a definition of the term "Indikationsspezifische Komplikation", which is of importance since the "5. Änderungsverordnung" of the "BPFLV-95" within the classification of the "Fallpauschalen". "Fallpauschalen" are a system like the American DRG's (Diagnosis related groups), but not exacly the same.
