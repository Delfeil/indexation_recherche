The primary patient age group for malignant germ cell tumors is 20-35 years. In this group testicular cancer is the most common tumor. Germ cell cancer has long been a model for curable neoplasm, and multimodal therapy regimes lead to cure rates of approximately 100%. Testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) is recognized as a precursor of seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors and is found by testicular biopsy with a diagnostic sensitivity of 99.5%. After 5-7 years, patients with TIN, if left untreated, have invasive growth in 50-70% of cases. At the time of diagnosis, 60% of patients with germ cell cancer show severe impairment of fertility, as it is the case in 25% of cases after successful therapy. Current case control studies and reports from andrological centers reveal an increased risk for testicular cancer in patients with impaired fertility. We found TIN in 5.3% of our andrological patients (n=114). Radiotherapy (18-20 Gy) was offered to patients with bilateral TIN or TIN in a single testis, and orchiectomy was performed in cases of inconspicuous contralateral testis. Both forms of therapy lead to cure rates of 100%. In selected patients with high risk for testicular cancer, TIN must be excluded by testicular biopsy when operative procedures on infertility are performed.
