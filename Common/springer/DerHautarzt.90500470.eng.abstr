Since 1977, data of patients with malignant melanomas have been systematically documented in the tumor registry of the Tumor Center Munich. Analysis of data of 8071 patients revealed that tumor thickness has steadily declined over the years. While in 1977 the median tumor thickness was 1.45 mm, it is now 0.75 mm. This has been followed by a significant improvement in overall survival. Males and older patients tend to have thicker melanomas than females and younger patients. There has been a relative increase of melanomas of the trunk. At diagnosis, 95% of patients had local disease. Of these patients, 18.3% developed metastastes. At least two-thirds of these patients had progression at the primary tumor site or the regional lymph nodes, both of which can be assessed by clinical or ultrasound examinations. Overall survival of patients with thin melanomas is excellent and does not differ substantially from the overall survival of the general population comparable in sex and age.
