It is difficult to assess blunt injuries in the region of the shoulder girdle because of the overlying acute and chronic processes. In assessments of rotator cuff ruptures in particular, in over 50% of cases the rupture could be explained by a degenerative process. This makes the assessment difficult, and also the decision as to whether or not the injury is due to an occupational accident. The diagnostic procedures applied should exclude a degenerative aetiology immediately after an accident in all cases. Rupture of the rotator cuff is often associated with an impingement syndrome and leads to corresponding symptoms in the subacromial space. Treatment of a rotator cuff rupture always involves a diagnostic arthroscopy as the first step, after which a reconstruction can be undertaken, either by way of the anterolateral approach after Neer or, in many cases, arthroscopically. Reconstruction of the rotator cuff must include outward mobilization of the muscles and a secure, mostly transosseous suture. Transference of a pedunculated tendon is indicated for large defects in the rotator cuff. In the case of dislocation of the shoulder with subsequent shoulder instability degenerative change and any possible multidirectional instability should be defined. Unidirectional instability with a demonstrable Bankart lesion has a good prognosis when surgery is performed without delay. In view of the high recurrence rate early treatment is indicated especially in young persons and in patients with a high activity level. Following detection of the Bankart lesion an arthroscopic procedure with refixation of the capsule-labrum complex is the method of choice.
