Different mite species may infest humans temporarily; such arthropods should be considered a possible cause of pruritic skin reactions of unclear origin. Pseudo-scabies is a common problem. This self-limiting dermatosis may often be misdiagnosed. Several mite species including Sarcoptes scabiei var. canis, Sarcoptes scabiei var. bovis, Notoedres cati, Cheyletiella yasguri, Cheyletiella blakei, Dermanyssus gallinae and Ophionyssus natricis may infest human skin, causing symptoms. Other less common animal mites, Neotrombicula autumnalis and foodstuff mites are also discussed.
