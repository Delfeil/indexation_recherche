General Psychotherapy isn't a new type of therapy, but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically-oriented psychotherapists. The contents of this model are defined. Arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods. The procedure rules should be joined together by a theoretical conception of psychological functioning, from which their relative significance and prescription conditions can be derived. A consistency-theory based model of psychological functioning is sketched, from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other. The advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed.
