  This prospective study was designed to compare quality of life, life satisfaction, and subjective ratings of health before and at variable time intervals after heart transplantation (HTx). 175 patients were included between February 1994 and December 1997. Every six months before and 1,5, 3, 6, and 12 months after HTx, they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires: German SF 36, heart failure and specific transplant symptom list, global quality of life assessment, Munich life quality dimension list, expected/experienced life changes after HTx, good command of the German language, and a minimum age of 18 years. During data evaluation, median (Me), mean (M), and standard deviation (SD) were created from individual parameters. Quality of life was rated as very poor by 84% of patients with congestive heart failure. Only 6 weeks after HTx, 74% rated their quality of life as significantly better. Before HTx 80% were very unsatisfied about their health status and 87% about physical performance. Six weeks after HTx, this parameter improved significantly and 76% were very satisfied about their health status and 50% about physical performance. While somatic changes expected before HTx corresponded well with experienced ones, psychological improvements were smaller than expected, but one year after HTx they were significant (before: M=3.66; SD=0.9; Range (R)=3.78 vs 12 months postop: M=4.61; SD=0.6; R=2.67; p<0.05). Quality of life correlated before HTx best with subjectively rated health (r=0.61, p<0.01) and 6 months after with satisfaction about health status (r=0.76, p<0.01). Only in 25% were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity/satisfaction, professional situation, and recreational activities. 90% of posttransplant patients reported physical compaints, most by effects of immunsuppression, but were coping well. The study shows that already 6 weeks after successful HTx all quality of life parameters improved significantly. Despite some unfulfilled expectations and complaints, the postoperative life situation of HTx patients appeared significantly improved.
