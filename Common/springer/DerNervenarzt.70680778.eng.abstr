Repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless method to induce transient activation in circumscript regions of the human cortex. In contrast to TMS with single pulses rTMS allows a more effective stimulation of association cortex and temporary interference with the proper functioning of stimulated areas. Possible applications for examination of the functional anatomy of language lateralisation, memory functions and visual perception are discussed. Possible therapeutic for movement  disorders and depression are discussed. On the basis of theoretical considerations  and current experience rTMS induced epileptogenic effects are discussed and safety  recommendations are given.
