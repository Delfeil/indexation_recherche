For the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorders during childhood and adolescence, multidimensional therapeutical approaches have proven useful in clinical practice. First controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of both psychotherapeutical and pharmacological strategies. Exposure and response prevention are considered the most efficient psychotherapeutical methods. On the basis of the available data, the question of the pharmacological dose can not be answered definitely. For Clomipramin, the dose most probably is between 75 mg and 150 mg, where as for Fluoxetine and Fluvoxamine 20mg-60 mg and 100mg-250 mg respectively. However, it has to be kept in mind that sometimes improvement of symptoms is not seen after 8-10 weeks of treatment. Basically it can be stated that todate there is an urgent need for therapeutical studies of obsessive-compulsive disorders in the childhood and adolescence. Most relevant would be studies evaluating pharmacological treatment versus a placebo control groups and carefully designed controlled psychotherapeutical treatment studies as well studies comparing pharmacological and psychotherapeutical approaches.
