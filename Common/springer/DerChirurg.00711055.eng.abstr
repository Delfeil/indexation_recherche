Abstract.  Anterior cruciate revision reconstruction is gaining more and more importance. Postoperative infection, a painful knee, limited range of motion and instability may make a second operation necessary. Results after revision ACL reconstruction are worse than results after primary ACL reconstruction. Analysis of the causes of failure and a therapeutic concept that is tailored to the individual case are preconditions for a successful reintervention. Revision ACL reconstruction has to be performed by an experienced knee surgeon who masters all the necessary techniques, from arthroscopy to arthrotomy and should be carefully planned.
