In a cadaver study on 10 human formalin-fixed hands we identified 3 different portals (palmar, radial and dorsal) for arthroscopy of the trapeziometacarpal joint and 1 portal (palmar) for the scaphotrapezial joint. In 8 cryoconserved human hands we performed standardized arthroscopy of these joints using the portals described above and arthroscopic resection of the cartilage of the trapezium and the first metacarpal. After marking the portals with needles, we made anatomical preparations of all the important structures of this region. We found slight lesions of the ligaments in 2 cases (oblique posterior ligament and trapeziometacarpal ligament). We did not see any lesion of the radial nerve or the radial artery, but in one case an injury of a branch of the cephalic vein. To get the full orientation in the trapeziometacarpal joint, it is sufficient to use two of these portals. To prevent any lesion of nerves and vessels, we recommend the palmar and the radial portal. The preparation showed that 65-85% of the cartilage of the trapezium was removed and 60-75% of the cartilage in the first metacarpal. Hence, we were able to prove experimentally that arthroscopically assisted removal of the cartilage of the trapeziometacarpal joint is possible.
