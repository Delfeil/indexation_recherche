 A considerable number of patients with cardiovascular diseases suffer from advanced heart failure. Actuarial 6-12 month survival of such patients is reduced to 50-75%. Since introduction of triple immunosuppression including cyclosporine, azathioprine and corticosteroids heart transplantation has been established as treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment. However, the increasing imbalance between demand and supply of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients for this therapeutic option and requires a more restrictive listing of patients for heart transplantation. During the last few years promising new conservativ and alternativ surgical therapies have been developed. The conservativ medical therapy was improved by application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive betablockers. Alternativ surgical therapies of advanced heart failure include high risk bypass surgery, high risk valve surgery, mechanical assist devices, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, partial left ventriculectomy, cardiomyoplasty and multisite-pacing. They serve as bridge to transplantation or medium- and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation. The therapeutic success is determined by adequate selection of patients for the respective therapy. This requires the implementation of risk scores on the basis of national and international registries of patients with advanced heart failure.
