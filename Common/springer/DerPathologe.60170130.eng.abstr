"NoToX Histological Fixative" is a formaldehyde substitute for the fixation of tissues prior to histological investigation. Intraoperative samples and necropsy tissue were tested. NoToX was substituted for formaldehyde in the fixation step, otherwise the same manufacturer-specified protocols were used for all reagents. Conventional histological and accepted immunohistological investigations, especially for tumour diagnosis, were used. In all tests, results with NoToX-fixated tissue were similar to those with tissue fixed with formaldehyde regarding both staining and diagnosis. NoToX is a useful substitute for formaldehyde.
