To evaluate whether MRI is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined. Tumor staging by CT and MR imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium. In MRI 4 out of 7 thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy, in CT none. In advanced renal carcinoma MRI with Gadolinium was superior to CT imaging, especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus. Consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by MRI which therefore may replace conventional cavography.
