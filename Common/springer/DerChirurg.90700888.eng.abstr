 The increasing number of biomaterials for the skeletal system requires mote and move their distinct clinical application. To guarantee useful therapeutic results the characteristics of the biomaterials have to be matched with the characteristics of the implantation site. Recently developed biodegradable polymers with a slow degradation process and longer stability are being increasingly clinically applied with a low complication rate. The development of new remodelable bone cements for bone-defect filling revives the idea of cement-metallic implant constructs. Finally, recombinant human bone growth factors are currently under controlled clinical examination with first promising results. Long-term results allowing common clinical use of these factors are still to be expected.
