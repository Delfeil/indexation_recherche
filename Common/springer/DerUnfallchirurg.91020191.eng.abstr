Despite of the good results of operative treatment disorders of fracture healing are still a challenge for surgeons. In some cases all endeavours are frustrating and bone does not heal. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (frequency: 1,5 MHz, pulsed by 1 KHz, signal burst width: 200 µsec, intensity: 30 mW/cm2) offers the opportunity of an alternative treatment. In contrast to magnetic field therapy, electric stimulation or use of extracorporal shock waves this therapy is judged positively all over the literature. Within an own series of 76 cases at present time we can show a 86 % healing rate under defined conditions. Within this paper we present three case reports, which clearly show the efficiency of low intensity pulsed ultrasound.
