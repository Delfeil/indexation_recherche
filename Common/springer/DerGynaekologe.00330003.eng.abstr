Since the history of humankind began, herbal medicines have had the most important role in the treatment of illnesses and disturbances of general wellbeing. It is only in the last few decades that pharmaceutical research and the rapid developments in conventional medicine have caused them to be regarded as "way out" and forced them into the realm of alternative medicine. In all this, those of us doctors who have undertaken conventional medical training should not forget that phytotherapy is anything but an invention of anti-establishment types who are against chemistry, based as it is on our forbears' long experience. We should respect this experience and draw on it to the benefit of the therapies we ourselves administer. As doctors we are now in a position to choose from among methods derived from purely conventional medicine, from phytotherapy and from other alternatives, e.g. balneotherapy, and even to combine these. We can can say that within the practice of gynaecology herbal medicine is very helpful in the treatment of conditions for which effective therapy is lacking, disturbances of general wellbeing and cyclic irregularities. Patient acceptance is very good, another plus point whose value should not be underestimated. In most cases phytotherapy is not dangerous, and side effects are not known for most herbal gynaecological medicines when they are used in therapeutic doses. One disadvantage of phytotherapy is that their effects are not always demonstrable with the methods available to conventional medicine, that is to say the so-called positive demonstration of efficacy is lacking. However, there should never be any question of the therapeutic options opened up by a treatment with herbal medicine being excluded because of budgetary considerations, especially as most patients would be prepared to accept a private prescription for such remedies should the situation arise.
