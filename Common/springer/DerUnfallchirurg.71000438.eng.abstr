The incidence of deep-vein- thrombosis is claimed to be reduced by avoiding intramedullary compression in the femur during implantation of the femoral part of a hip prosthesis. A double-blind randomized trial investigated 101 patients with and 102 without avoidance of intramedullary compression. There was no evidence of the benefit of this technique, for the reduction of postoperative deep-vein thrombosis.
