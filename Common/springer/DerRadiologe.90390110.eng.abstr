The implantation of stent grafts is a relatively new method for the treatment of aneurysms of the aorta or peripheral aneurysms. Before the implantation precise measurements are mandatory to obtain the necessary information about the aneurysm. The numerous contraindications must be observed strictly to successfully exclude the aneurysmal sac. The stent graft is inserted via a percutaneous puncture or, in the case of an aortic graft, through a surgical arteriotomy. After the implantation rigorous follow-up is mandatory to detect complications such as leaks or thrombi: Spiral CT angiography is the method of choice. Some of the complications require secondary interventions such as the implantation of additional stent grafts. The results are encouraging, with a secondary exclusion rate of the aneurysm of up to more than 95%; however, long-term results are not available.
