Vulvodynia is a complex syndrome of chronic vulvar pain. It is divided into several subtypes: 1. cyclic vulvovaginitis (pain occurs after coitus), 2. vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (pain mainly with intercourse), 3. dysaesthetic vulvodynia (psychosomatic; diagnosis of exclusion), 4. vulvar dermatoses (e.g. pemphigus vulgaris, contact dermatitis). Additional causes have been described in single cases. Though vulvodynia is often accompanied by psychological distress, somatic causes have to be considered in each case.
