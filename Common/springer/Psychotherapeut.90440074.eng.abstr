The author gives a short overview of the changes in the conception of man which  have taken place in the psychoanalytic developmental psychology since Freud. He describes some selected results of the recent infant research and concentrates in detail on one of its central findings, namely the significance of low states of tension for the formation of normal and pathological psychic structures. It thus becomes apparent that psychoanalysis has for a long time underestimated the influence of daily undramatic interactional experiences on character formation. Finally the author moves on to discuss whether this "rehabilitation of everyday experiences" represents a playing down of Freudian anthropology or a necessary correction.
