Friedreich's ataxia (FA) represents a degenerative, genetically determined disease of the nervous system in combination with myocardial affection and in some cases endocrinological disturbances. Manifestation of myocardial involvement usually follows symptoms of nervous system degeneration later in the course, but seems not to be secondary. These cardiac disturbances are the main cause of death in FA-patients. Therapeutic management of heart disease is possible and interdisciplinary neurologic-cardiologic cooperation should start early in the course of FA.
