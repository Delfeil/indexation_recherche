Chronic nasal obstruction is a common disorder, mostly caused by hypertrophied inferior turbinates. If there is inadequate response to conservative medical management, the inferior turbinates should be reduced. The choice of treatment is mainly influenced by whether the nasal airway obstruction is due to hypertrophic mucosa or to an enlarged turbinate bone. The first part of this review describes the various surgical modalities for treatment of swelling of the turbinal mucosa. The indications, advantages, disadvantages, complications, and controversies of each modality (submucous diathermy, cryosurgery, infra-red coagulation, argon-plasma coagulation, radiofrequency, laser surgical techniques) are reviewed and discussed.
