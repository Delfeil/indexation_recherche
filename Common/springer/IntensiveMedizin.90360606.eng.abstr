 In the USA, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been approved for therapy of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within a 3 hour time window based on the results of the NINDS [1] trial. Only few patients with AIS are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms, and only 3% of these patients qualify for treatment with rt-PA. Therefore, only few patients with AIS will potentially benefit from therapy with rt-PA if NINDS criteria are applied. The goal of the Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in AIS for a 6 hour time window.
