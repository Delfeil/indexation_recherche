 Purpose: The experience with the endoluminal treatment of abdominal, infrarenal aortic aneurysms with two different stent devices is reported. Material and methods: Some 33 males and one female, between 52 and 81 years of age were treated for infrarenal aortic aneurysm. A Vanguard stent was used in 23 patients (19 bifurcated, four tube) and a Talent stent in 11 (seven bifurcated, four tube). The two different stent designs were selected depending on the diameter of the aneurysmal neck and the iliac arteries. All procedures were performed under general anaesthesia in the angiographic suite. Results: The primary technical success rate was 85.3%; the secondary success rate was 91.1%. Primary and secondary clinical success were 61.7 and 79.4% respectively. During a follow-up of 22 months, we saw seven late complications, which required an open operation three times. Conclusion: With both stent systems, the same results as with open repair could not be reached. At present, the pros and cons for both systems seem to be balanced. Both are to be improved.
