 The administration of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists has been shown to be effective in reducing myocardial infarction and cardial death when given before PTCA. This prospective study was performed to determine the efficacy of abciximab in a bail-out situation to manage threatened or acute vessel closure.   Methods: Acute or threatened vessel closure was observed in 104 (5.5%) out of 1903 consecutive patients treated with PTCA in our institution. Of the 104 patients 46 (44%) were treated for unstable angina (CCS IV). Abciximab was administered in bail-out situations in a dosage of 0.25mg/kg given as a bolus, which was followed by an intravenous infusion of 10µg/min over 12 hours. Repeat PTCA was performed shortly after the administration of the abciximab bolus. After the procedure, the sheathe was left in place and control angiography was carried out 24 h later.   Results: In 100 of the 104 patients TIMI flow III could be restored by abciximab therapy and RePTCA. In 4 patients an additional stent implantation was necessary due to persistent flow limitation. One day post PTCA, early follow-up angiography demonstrated patency of all vessels except two. In-hospital events occurred in 4 patients. Three of these patients underwent emergency CABG due to subacute vessel closure a few hours after PTCA and died during or directly after surgery. Follow-up after one year included clinical status and control angiography of the target vessel. During long-term follow-up, MACE occured in 15 patients (2 MI, 8 CABG and 5 RePTCA).   Conclusion: The results of this prospective trial demonstrate the efficacy of abciximab therapy in bail-out situations occurring during or early after PTCA. The use of abciximab in bail-out situations appears clinically beneficial. Further studies have to compare the efficacy of this approach with prophylactic abciximab treatment.
