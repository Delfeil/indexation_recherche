Abstract.  Purpose: In recent years, the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery has been well-documented with quality-of-life data. The aim of the present study was to describe the efficacy of laparoscopic redo-surgery using health-related and disease-specific quality-of-life data. Methods: A sample of 30 patients with mean age of 56 years underwent laparoscopic refundoplication. In 18 patients the primary antireflux procedure was performed by the open technique. In 12 cases the primary intervention was performed laparoscopically. To evaluate quality-of-life the German SF-36 Health Survey and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) were used and given to all patients before and 3 months and 1 year after redo-surgery. Results: Before surgery, in two (physical functioning, role physical) out of 8 dimensions of SF-36 the values have not decreased significantly (P < 0.05) compared to healthy individuals. Three months after laparoscopic redo-surgery all reduced dimensions improved significantly (P < 0.05). One year after surgery all dimensions are stable and comparable to a healthy population. Prior to redo-surgery, the mean GIQLI was 86.7 points and improved significantly (P < 0.05) to 121.6 and 123.8 points (3 months and 1 year after refundoplication) and reached an equivalent level of comparable healthy individuals (122.6 points). There are no significant differences between patients with an open and laparoscopic initial antireflux procedure at all times of measurement. Postoperative data of only 28 patients were included because in two patients conversion was necessary due to operative problems. Conclusion: Because of these results laparoscopic refundoplication can be discussed as an effective method of treatment after failed primary antireflux procedure. Laparoscopic redo-surgery normalizes objective outcome criteria and also improves quality of life.
