The microvascular ulnar forearm flap is compared with the radial forearm flap for soft tissue reconstruction in the head and neck region. In 67 patients 44 ulnar forearm and 23 radial forearm flaps were applied. The two groups were compared regarding flap dissection, suitability of the flap for the recipient region, complication rate and secondary morbidity of the donor region. The ulnar forearm flap is favoured due to the less hairy skin of the ulnar forearm region and the more conveniently located donor area. The ulnar forearm flap pedicle is long compared with alternative transplants but shorter than the radial pendant.
