Most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures. Depending on the scope of the sutures affected, the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects. The etiopathology is still unclear. Various therapies have been developed over the past 100 years. However, Tessier's technique of fronto-orbital advancement has been an important milestone in the treatment of these malformations. Numerous adjustments have since perfected this operational technique. It is now possible to treat practically all skull malformations with the surgical techniques available today. At the same time, these techniques have also aided the advancements in tumor surgery and traumatology.
