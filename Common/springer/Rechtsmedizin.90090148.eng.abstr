Thromboses of the cerebral veins which occur at a frequency of 3.75 to 9.3% in autopsy material are caused by local or systemic inflammatory processes, hematological disorders, neoplasms or traumatic brain damage. We report on a 14-year-old girl who suffered from colitis ulcerosa during the last 4 years of life. Immediately after a brawl with a schoolboy she complained of headache and vertigo, but no physical abnormality was detected by the physician. She was admitted to the hospital after becoming comatose during the following night. On neurological examination she was comatous with a decerebrate state, the pupils were small and non-reactive to light, divergent ocular bulbi and bilateral extensor plantar responses. A cerebral computer tomogramm showed a cerebral edema and a hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia and both cerebral ventricles which subsequently increased to the right cerebral ganglia, the corpus callosum and the right cerebral hemisphere. Despite antiedematous therapy the girl died on the second day after the brawl. A neuropathology examination revealed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus extending to the internal cerebral veins and a bilateral hemorrhagic infarction of the thalamus and the basal ganglia with intraventricular hemorrhage. As the thrombus in the sagittal sinus showed signs of organisation, a postraumatic origin alone is improbable and a hemorrheological disorder due to colitis ulcerosa seemed to be the main cause.
