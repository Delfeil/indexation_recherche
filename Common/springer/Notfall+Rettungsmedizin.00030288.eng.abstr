Most frequent injuries of the eye in the paediatric age are chemical or thermal injuries, corneal erosion, corneal foreign body, ocular contusion, blow-out-fracture, penetrating eye injury, endophthalmitis and traumatic retinopathy. The number of eye injuries per year is about 12 of 100.000. At least one third of these injuries occur at an age of <12 years. They represent the most frequent cause for an unilateral blindness. Age below 5 years, sex (male > female), care by parents are known risk factors for an eye injury in the paediatric age. Visual rehabilitation after eye injury can be affected by a quick and adequate therapy as well as several social factors (e. g., compliance in wearing glasses or treatment for amblyopia).
