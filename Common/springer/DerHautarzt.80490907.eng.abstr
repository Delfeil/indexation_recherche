Helicobacter pylori infection has been assumed to be the underlying cause of some dermatological diseases such as, chronic urticaria. In order to investigate this problem we interviewed 55 patients with chronic urticaria concerning the state of the disease approximately 10 months after being discharged from hospital. After an additional six months we interviewed them for a second time and thus determined the remission ratio. There was no significant evidence showing that a link exists between urticaria and proven Helicobacter pylori infection (2-Test). There was also no significant correlation in the remission ratio between patients treated with a triple therapy and non-treated patients (exact Fisher-Test).
