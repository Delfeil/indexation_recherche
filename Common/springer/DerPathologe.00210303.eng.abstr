True arterial aneurysms of the infrapopliteal vessels are a rare finding. During surgical treatment of convergent aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk. We describe the special features of diagnosis, histology, and the surgical treatment of aneurysms of the crural arteries. We recommend that even asymptomatic aneurysms be electively operated on to prevent further complications.
