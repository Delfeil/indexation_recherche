The identification of angiogenetic growth factors was the basis for the development of novel strategies for the treatment of occlusive vascular diseases. Therapeutic angiogenesis resulting in capillary sprouting (angiogenesis) and collateral vessel development (arteriogenesis) may be a potential alternative for patients suffering from critical limb ischemia. Extensive investigations performed in vitro and in vivo demonstrated therapeutic efficacy through the enhancement of collateral growth resulting in augmented blood flow in ischemic tissues following administration of both, recombinant growth factors and genes encoding for such factors.
