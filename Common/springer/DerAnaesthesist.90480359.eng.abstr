The additive properties of general and regional anesthetic techniques are brought together in combined anesthesia to minimise side effects of the individual techniques. Despite a wide experience with both used as single anesthetic techniques, no definite recommendations regarding indications, general contraindications and procedure exist for their combination. Beneficial effects on haemodynamics, respiratory function, intestinal motility and postoperative stress response have been demonstrated for a combination of general anesthesia and thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA). In addition TEA is favourable in the management of postoperative pain, which has advantageous effects on convalescence especially in a high risk patient group. Nevertheless, until now no reduction of perioperative morbidity and mortality has been demonstrated. Since the combination of two anesthesia techniques theoretically increases the rate of complication, the expected benefit for the patient must predominate. To estimate the risks and benefits of combined anesthesia, the anesthesiologist must be familiar with each single method, as well as with the synergistic effects of both techniques in order to evaluate the individual indication.
