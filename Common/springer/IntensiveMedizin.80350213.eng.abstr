 Background: The use of intravenous heparin is essential for the treatment of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. A significant rebound of thrombin generation within 6 to 10 hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported. This time window is clinically critical as the incidence of recurrent ischemia peaks in this period. It has therefore been recommended to gradually taper heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly. However, it is not known which dosing procedure is useful and whether it definitly reduces thrombin rebound.
