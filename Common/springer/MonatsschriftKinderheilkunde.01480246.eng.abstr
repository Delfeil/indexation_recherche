Barth syndrome is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by dilated cardiomyopathy, myopathy and neutropenia. We describe a family with two affected males. One of them died during infancy from cardiomyopathy. The other, now adult, is less severe affected. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of a missense mutation in the responsible gene G4.5. In the case of two further boys, who died during the neonatal period, the same diagnosis may be said to apply retrospectively, based on available results.
