Between 1.4.96 and 1.3.97 27 patients with acute infections of bone and soft tissues (n = 13), chronic osteomyelitis (n = 8), and chronic wounds (n = 6) were treated by using Instillation-Vacuum-Sealing. Polyvinylalcohol sponges with drainage tubes were used to cover the internal or external wound surfaces which resulted from surgical debridement. Having hermetically covered the wound with a transparent film dressing a vacuum source generated a partial vacuum in the sponge which was modified according to the type of wound between 20 and 80 kPa. Several times daily, the vacuum line was blocked and, in an alternating fashion, antiseptic or antibiotic solution instilled for 30 minutes. Then, the vacuum was reestablished and the fluids drained from the wound. Seven days later, intermittent drug instillation was stopped and there was either immediate or delayed wound closure by secondary suturing (n = 22), skin grafting (n = 3) or spontaneous epithelialization (n = 2). During a follow-up from the beginning of the instillation treatment of 4,2 (3-14) months there was one recurrency of infection in a patient with chronic osteomyelitis.
