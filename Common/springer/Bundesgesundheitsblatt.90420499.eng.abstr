Results from typing MRSA originating from different clinical sources in all Germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the mecA gene to clonal groups of S. aureus which have been until now sensitive.

Worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by S. aureus possessing secC and not tst.
