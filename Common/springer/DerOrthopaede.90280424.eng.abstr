The vertebral bodies and vertebral arches show a characteristic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone. The pedicles are loaded by uniplanar bending that is reflected by the arrangement of the Corticalis. The ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and (with exception of the lig. longitudinale anterius) horizontal/oblique segmental ligament bundles. In combination with the anulus fibrosus, the ligaments work as a kind of gear system. They regulate the process of movements of adjactent vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion. Besides maintaining the necessary amount of pretension the intervertebral disc distributes the loads uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies. The intervertebral joints are important for guided motion, by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions. Because of their position, they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes. The integrity of the fascia thoracolumbalis warrants the protective function of the autochthonuos muscles.
