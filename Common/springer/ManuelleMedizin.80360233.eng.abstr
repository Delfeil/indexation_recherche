In 14 patients with acute LBP the effect of manual therapy was examined. The examination was conducted with the Triflexometer, which is an electromechanical measuring instrument for examination of the posture and function of the spine. This instrument makes possible the measurement of the spine in resting as well as in moving positions, and it is also suitable for recording local disturbances of the movement. In our study we measured the spine from C7 to S2 in the sagittal and frontal planes. Improvement in movement was detected in all patients following manual therapy, as well as in ante-, retro- and lateral flexion on both sides, and local functional disturbances also disappeared partially or totally. Our study shows that the Triflexometer makes it possible to record the effect of manual therapy in acute LBP. The proof of the local functional disturbances after manual therapy indicates that these patients have a higher risk of new episodes of acute LBP or perhaps of chronic LBP, and because of that there it is necessary to use other treatment forms.
