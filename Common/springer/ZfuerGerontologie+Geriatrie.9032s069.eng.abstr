  Malnutrition is known to be very common in geriatric patients. The incidence is ranging from 30 to 60 % of all patients. Therefore, indication for nutritional support via nasogastric or percutaneous tubes is frequently given. Since percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has several advantages over nasogastric tube feeding including reduced risk of tube displacement and blockage, and higher patient acceptance, it has become the method of choice in enteral tube feeding. Complication rates are low provided that guidelines for enteral tube feeding are considered. Early home enteral nutrition contributes to patients quality of life.
