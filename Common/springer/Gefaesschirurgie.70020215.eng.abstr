 Rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication. Mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature. This paper reports on a 51-year-old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using V-Y technique. On day 8 after operation, the carotid bulb ruptured. The suture line was not involved. The rupture was due to local wall necrosis, as verified by histologic examination. In an emergency procedure the necrotized tissue was resected and repaired using a Dacron patch. Postoperatively the patient showed paresis of the left recurrent nerve but fortunately did not suffer any other neurological deficit.
