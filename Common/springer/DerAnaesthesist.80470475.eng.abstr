Children are very sensible to the occurrence of intraoperative hypothermia (HT) (core temperature <=36.0 C) during general anaesthesia because their regulation capacity is less effective than in adults and due to a large skin-surface area compared with their body mass. We compared the efficacy of different heating devices to prevent HT in children during surgery.
