Lithium therapy in patients with manic-depressive disorder occasionally causes neuropsychiatric side effects even at therapeutic serum levels. Those lithium-induced symptoms can be polymorphous and may be hard to differentiate from other disorders and from other drugs' side effects. We report the case of a 56-year-old woman with manic- depressive illness, who developed neuropsychiatric side effects from lithium prophylaxis at therapeutic serum levels. The symptoms included disorientation, aphasia, ideatoric apraxia, parkinsonism, restlessness and severe sleep disorder. In contrast to previous reports, the causal role of lithium was underscored by symptom increase after lithium reexposure at therapeutic serum levels. The patient recovered completely after cessation of the lithium prophylaxis.
