 Sequential radical debridement and early soft-tissue reconstruction have considerably decreased the amputation rate, length of hospital stay, chronic osteitis, the rehabilitation period and secondary reconstructive procedures in lower leg injuries. The introduction of distraction osteotomy and "biologic osteosynthesis procedures" have led to shorter and safer osteoplastic methods. The indication, tactics and technical pitfalls of current interdisciplinary treatment options requiring modifications in soft-tissue coverage are presented.
