Persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders, especially hypospadias.

The etiology, diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed. A complex case of penile-scrotal hypospadia, hypoplastic prostate gland, testicular ectopia and retrovesical cyst is presented.
