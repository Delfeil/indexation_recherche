The Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) is a new instrument to analyze the three-dimensional structure of the retina. It is based on confocal laser scanning technology. Scientific interest has so far focused on the follow-up of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage. As parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be reproduced with a high degree of accuracy, this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk.
