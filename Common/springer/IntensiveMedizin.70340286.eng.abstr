 A penetrating chest injury is often associated with respiratory insufficiency due to primary hindrance of gas exchange or the respiratory mechanical function. Additional cardiocirculatory disturbances caused by bleeding or injury of the heart are often life-threatening. The preclinical treatment should aim to optimize ventilation and oxygenation, to recognize and treat tension pneumothorax and pericardial tamponade and also to transport the patient to a hospital where cardiac surgery is feasible. A penetrating injury of the left anterior hemithorax is suggestive of a direct injury to the heart. If the function of the circulatory system is unstable, then the patient must be sternotomized immediately. If the function of the circulatory system is stable only basic diagnostics are required. If the patient is becoming more unstable or in case of any doubt, an operative exploration should be performed. We describe a 41-year old male patient who sustained left thoracic trauma after a stab injury. Dissection of the left internal mammary artery and the left lung led to massive hemothorax. The patient was initially transported to a hospital with a cardiac surgery department and was sternotomized within 30 min of arrival.
