The decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy. Especially in medical expert appraisements the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient. The purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative pathomorphologic shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases. This study reports of 56 patients with rotator cuff tears which were devided in primarily acute, subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness. We considered the location of the tear, the shape and the size. Furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon, its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined. The results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not. The isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is siginificant for the trauma. In comparison with the degenerative study group the tenosynovitis and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study sigificant for traumatic tears.
