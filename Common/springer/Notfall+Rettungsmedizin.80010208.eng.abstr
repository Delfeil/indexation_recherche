During disaster situations in hospitals the need for medical care exceeds by far the  actual medical capacity and supplies of the particular hospital. Therefore adequate management of these situations can only be assured by disaster management plans (DMP) individually adapted to the characteristic situation of the hospital. The purpose of this survey in 522 participating hospitals is to gain a general overview of DMP in Germany. Only 83.5% of all hospitals were actually in possession of a DMP. However, 54.8% of these plans did not differentiate between internal and external disasters. Additionally 22.4% of these DMPs were never or only very irregularly revised and disaster excercises never been performed in 51.2% of the hospitals. In contrast to this, 14.5% of all hospitals had to activate their DM in the past and 51.6% of the management boards of these hospitals expected their residents to initiate the DMP, but only 25.3% of the management boards inform their medical staff about the existence and content of the DMP. Therefore it must be concluded that, currently, adequate management of disasters in German hospitals cannot be guaranteed. In order to be well prepared for these extraordinary emergency situations in all hospitals, DMPs must be revised at least once or twice a year and the medical staff must be informed about the contents of DMPs. Additionally, disaster excercises should be performed so that the staff is confident in the practical handling of the DMP.
