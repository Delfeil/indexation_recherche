The routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine. New trends in perinatal medicine, aiming at more individual and self-determined pregnancy and delivery, are realizable because of the safety provided by ultrasound. Often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations, but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy: early detection of fetal viability; intrauterine localization of the pregnancy; exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy; later in pregnancy, confirmation of appropriate fetal growth, position and localization of placenta site. In addition, the development of close mother-child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact. These aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child.
