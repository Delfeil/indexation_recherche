To show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot. We examinated 10 cadaver foots of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial 20 healthy patients with 10 to 20-MHz-probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region. Especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic (saving of expenses, lack of radiation, side-to-side comparison).
