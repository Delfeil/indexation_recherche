  A case of atypical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with a calcified apical thrombus is presented. A 42 year old asymptomatic patient was admitted for evaluation of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) which was recorded when the patient suffered from a bronchitis. The ECG showed giant negative T-waves in leads II, III, aVF, V3 to V6 associated with high QRS voltages in the precordial leads. The chest X-ray and fluoroscopy demonstrated a calcification in projection to the apical region of the heart. Echocardiography and the left ventricular (LV) cineangiography showed hypertrophy of the apical LV myocardium and an obliteration of the apical LV cavity. Magnetic resonance imaging identified a calcified thrombus in the apical cavity of the LV in the setting of an atypical HCM.
