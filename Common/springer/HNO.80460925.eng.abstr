Oral food intake in patients with obstructing pharyngeal and esophageal carcinomas is commonly insufficient because of tumor-induced dysphagia which gives rise to cachexia unless treated. While entailing an unfavorable prognosis, malnutrition is often a therapy-limiting factor. Tube feeding with liquid formula diets currently offers the most efficient and least-risky approach to long-term use and is best adopted even at a pre-treatment stage irrespective of the tumor therapy intended. A feeding tube placed by a percutaneous endoscopically controlled gastrostomy (PEG) increasingly offers an alternative to a nasogastric tube. After using diaphanoscopy, the stomach is punctured from outside under local anesthesia and a feeding tube inserted by means of a retrograde thread or a direct puncture method. A modification of the direct puncture method has been preferred at the Magdeburg University E.N.T. Department. The tube is held in place by thermally activated helical winding of a gastic tube end (using a memory-retaining helix). During the 1991-1996 period 415 patients with obstructing carcinomas of the upper digestive tract were treated with a feeding tube. No fatal complications were observed. Severe complications (peritonitis) occurred in three patients. In 160 patients with PEG the following parameters were recorded: weight-to-size index, body mass index, degree of dysphagia, nutrition status, lymphocyte count, total serum protein and patients' compliance to PEG. The enteral nutrition therapy used was indicated in all of the patients treated with advanced carcinomas of the head and neck. In 81% of the patients the compliance to PEG was positive. Findings demonstrated that long-term intestinal nutrition via PEG was a safe and effective form of treatment. Inserting the tube by the direct puncture method was advantageous for patients with carcinomas in the upper digestive tract as only few mechanical alterations take place along tumorous tissues following PEG while contamination with bacteria and neoplastic cells from the tumor region into the abdomen are precluded.
