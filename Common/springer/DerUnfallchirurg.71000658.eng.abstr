Biodegradable implants are increasingly used in orthopedic and trauma surgery. Many different implants consisting of different biodegradable polymers are currently available. Different factors contribute to the biocompatibility of these implants, and local foreign-body reactions remain a matter of concern. Therefore, it is mandatory to document and compare the tissue reactions caused by various biodegradable implants in experimental or clinical studies. We have developed a standardized system of classification based on our previous experimental and clinical observations. Foreign-body reactions are differentiated into osteolyses (O-0 to O-4), extra-articular (EA-0 to EA-4) and intra-articular (IA-0 to IA-4) soft-tissue reactions.
