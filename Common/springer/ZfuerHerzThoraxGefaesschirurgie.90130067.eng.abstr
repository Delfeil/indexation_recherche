 A decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or "wrapping" may lead to a partial loss of the arterial Windkessel-function. The following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance.  In 8 pigs, the wall of the ascending aorta was wrapped with a prosthesis. This approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta, like extracorporal circulation, cardioplegia or blood loss. Flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention, and following Fourier Transformation, the aortic input impedance was calculated.  Mean pressure, mean flow, and total peripheral resistance were unaltered, while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the "wrapping" procedure. Thus, it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load.
