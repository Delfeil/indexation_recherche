  Patients with refractory angina pectoris and end-stage coronary artery disease represent an increasing clinical problem. Numbers of these patients will increase in the future for improved survival due to effective secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Next to the evaluation of clinical symptoms non-invasive objective parameters of myocardial ischemia are of major relevance before initiation of alternative treatment modalities and for verification of antiischemic effectiveness. Based on our own experience it can be shown that in these patients testing which is mainly based on the patients physical exercise capacity is only of limited value due to the early occurence of clinical symptoms. Furthermore diffuse perfusion abnormalities reduce the sensitivity of electrocardiographic and scintigraphic detection of ischemic changes. In contrast indirect measures of ischemia relating to the systolic or diastolic function of the left ventricle like dopplerechocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography seem to be promising approaches. This is confirmed by the results from the application of long-term intermittent urokinase therapy. Long-term intermittent urokinase therapy leads to an absolute enhancement of myocardial perfusion, which makes this approach superior to other medical interventions which are mainly based on a reduction of cardiac work-load.
