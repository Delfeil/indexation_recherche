The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0.2-T MRI unit and a 1.0-T MRI unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament. Twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent MRI of the knee on both 0.2-T and 1.0-T MRI units. Three independent observers evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. Frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities, and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic. Sixteen of 24 patients had signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament on the 1.0-T unit; the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 15/16 (93 %) patients and secondary signs in 7/12 (43 %) patients. In 8 patients the 1.0 T unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament; in these patients the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 1/8 cases (12 %), and secondary signs in 3/8 cases (37 %). Observer agreement was very good for the 1.0-T unit and fair for the 0.2-T unit. There is no substantial difference between 1.0-T units and 0.2-T MRI units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament. In the visualisation of secondary signs, 1.0-T units are superior to 0.2-T units, and there is a surprisingly high rate of false-positive results with the 0.2-T unit. As to the reproducibility of the results, the 1.0-T unit is far superior to the 0.2-T unit.
