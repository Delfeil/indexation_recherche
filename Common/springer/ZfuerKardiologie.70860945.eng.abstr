 Background: In patients after atrial switch operation (Mustard or Senning procedure) for transposition of the great arteries (TGA), the anatomic right (anterior) ventricle works as the systemic ventricle. Although this is associated with an increased rate of congestive heart failure, the prognosis for long-term survival is good. Therefore a large proportion of these patients has reached their reproductive years and consult cardiologists and obstetricians because they plan a pregnany or are already pregnant. Because of the substantial hemodynamic changes and the increase in cardiac output during pregnancy, potential risk factors and complications have to be considered. Patients: Initiated by the presentation of a pregnant patient with TGA after surgery in our hospital, we analyzed the information referenced in MEDLINE. Including our patient, there were reports on 27 patients after the Mustard procedure with a total of 39 pregnancies. Fetal outcome: Three abortions occurred during the first trimenon, another one was electively induced because of maternal cardiac deterioration. One late abortion occurred in 23rd week of pregnancy. 35 babies (one twinpair) were born healthy without cardiovascular anomalies. Maternal outcome: No maternal deaths occurred. Eight women developed clinical signs of systemic (= right) heart failure including all three patients with former complex TGA. Four of these patients recovered after delivery, four showed persistent reduction of physical abilities or signs of heart failure. Further complications were supraventricular tachycardias (five patients) and a high incidence of hypertension and pre-eclampsia (22% of patients). Conclusion: Overall, the outcome for mothers after Mustard procedure for TGA and their children ist good, but there is need for intensive and spzialized follow-up.
