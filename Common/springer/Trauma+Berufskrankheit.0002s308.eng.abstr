In general, fracture treatment of the upper extremities should be definitive. Planned changes of procedure are acceptable in grade 2 and 3 open fractures, especially those of the forearm. The aim is to change to a definitive procedure, such as ORIF with plates or intramedullary nailing, after the soft tissues have healed. For open humeral fractures the indications for definitive treatment became wider with the availability of titanium nails, and the significance of external fixation devices has declined. Infections after ORIF, but also nonunions, mostly also make a change of procedure when the upper extremity is concerned. The selection of a second or even a third procedure has to be decided individually, depending on the fracture and the soft tissue conditions, but also on the patient's situation. Hardly any high-quality studies with sufficiently high numbers of patients are available on this subject.
