The diagnosis of occult fractures of the scaphoid bone is even more challenging than that of conventional fractures of the scaphoid. This study aimed to compare prospectively the gold standard method (plain radiographs in four projections, after about 14 days) and the primary findings with direct magnification radiography (DIMA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Primary MRI showed much higher diagnostic power than plain radiography at 10-14 days in occult scaphoid fractures and in detection of associated carpal injuries. This may lead to a decreasing time of disease. DIMA was inferior in detecting occult fractures of the scaphoid.
