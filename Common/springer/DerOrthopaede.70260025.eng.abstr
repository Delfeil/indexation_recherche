The role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter. This paper reports the results of the Austrian ultrasound hip screening program, in which all Austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice: at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12-16 weeks. Data from all public health insurance companies since 1985 and all ICD data about children hospitalized because of CDH in Austria were collected and analyzed. The rate of sonographically pathological hips was 6.57 % (1994). The treatment rate before introduction of hip sonography was 13.16 % (1985). The rate of open reduction went down to 0.24 per 1000 newborns, including a high number of unscreened children born abroad and also children with teratological dislocation of the hip. Hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia. The optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only "high risk" hips (clinical instability, positive family history, breech delivery) should undergo hip sonography, but at an age between 4 and 6 weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature. Since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening, a further reduction of costs could be accomplished. Disability owing to DDH can be avoided in a number of cases, and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be economized.
