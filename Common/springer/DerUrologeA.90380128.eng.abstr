We were interested in the effectivity and morbidity of URS as an auxiliary treatment in patients who underwent ESWL for ureteral (n = 71) and kidney stones (n = 31). Between 1991 and 1995, 102 URS were performed for treatment of ureteral fragments. 28 (27.5 %) were located in the proximal, 24 (23.5 %) in the middle and 50 (49 %) in the distal ureter. In 25 cases, fragmentes were found as "Steinstrasse". In the same period of time, 2554 patients with ureteral stones were treated with ESWL alone, therefore the overall rate of URS was low (4 %). URS alone had a stonefree success rate of 58.9 %. The success rate depended on the location of the ureteral stone: proximal 25 %, middle 50 % and distal 82 %. URS combined with ESWL showed an overall success rate of 97.9 %. Finally, only 2 patients (2,1 %) required an open surgery. 29.3 % of the stones were treated by extraction only. The extraction of stone was the most frequent procedure to remove the fragments after ESWL. The rate of complications were 6.9 %. None of the patients suffered from late complications like stricture of the ureter. The URS for the treatment of stone fragments after ESWL has been shown to be an effective and safe procedure with a low rate of complications.
