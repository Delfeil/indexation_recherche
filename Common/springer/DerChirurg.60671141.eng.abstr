 From January 1987 to March 1994 three hospitals in the city of Magdeburg treated a total of 103 subcutaneous Achilles tendon ruptures operatively. We created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used. Important aspects of the follow-up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a KIN-TREX dynamic measuring device and the clinical check-up in comparison with the histological results and the patients' history. Degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38,8 % of the cases. The average score of all OP methods applied was 767 of possible 1000 points. The adaptation suture (781 points), Silfverskiold's technique (772 points) and the fibrin adhesive technique (754 points) showed approximately the same results. The theory that all of the ruptures have a histological degeneration background seems to be wrong. Isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load.
