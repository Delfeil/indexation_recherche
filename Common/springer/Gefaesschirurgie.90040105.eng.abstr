 For several years now, external comparative quality assurance for surgical tracer diagnosis has proven helpful and produced important evidence. Venous insufficiency is a considerable medico-economic issue. Even so, there is to date no defined consensus on pre- and postoperative diagnostic methods, operative procedures, and after treatment in varicose vein surgery. Nationwide data on the methods used, patient satisfaction, and the quality of patient care are lacking. This is why external quality assurance is required in surgery of varicose veins and also required by German federal law (SGB V).
