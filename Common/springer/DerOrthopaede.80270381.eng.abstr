As a part of a long-term follow up (I) of 544 cemented Müller-curved stem total hip replacements (THR), implanted 1977 to 1983, 207 THR in 163 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were evaluated 9 to 15 years (11 on an average) postoperatively. The feed back rate was 96.9 % so the results are very reliable. 18 cups were loosened (13 already changed), but no stem had to be changed for aseptic loosening. 2 THR (1.0 %) had to be revised because of deep infection. Survival rate of Kaplan and Meier for aseptic loosening was 94.6 % after 10 years, 83.5 % after 15 years.
