 Right colon diverticulitis, representing 1-3,6 % of cases of diverticular disease is an uncommon cause of right lower quadrant pain. Its presentation is difficult to distinguish from acute appendicitis. Patients are between 35 and 50 years old, have a history of 2-3 days of abdominal pain and few gastrointestinal symptoms. The diagnosis is best confirmed by computed tomography and colonoscopy. Conservative treatment is justified in uncomplicated disease, whereas perforations, abcesses and inflammatory tumors require resection. We describe the cases of six patients treated at our institution from 1991 to 1996. Presentation, geographic variations, diagnostic procedures and management are discussed.
