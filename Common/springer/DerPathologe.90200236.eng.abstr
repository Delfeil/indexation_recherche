Squamous cell carcinoma as a late complication of chronic osteomyelitis is a well known phenomenon in traumatology, often occurring as a consequence of bone fractures. The majority of cases are observed in men between 50 and 60 years of age. The time from onset of inflammatory bone disease to malignant transformation differs but usually takes 30 years. In general, prognosis is thought to be favorable when adequate surgical therapy is carried out. Nowadays, it is important to recall this condition, because it has become rare. The cases reported here illustrate the difficulties that may be encountered in diagnosing malignant transformation, especially in lesions that develop in deep tissue layers and which may be responsible for various biopsies failing to reveal the true pathology.
