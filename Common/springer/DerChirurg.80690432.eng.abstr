The quality of the surgical therapy in cases of acute appendicitis is influenced by the rate of perforating appendicitis, the rate of bland appendicitis and the perioperative morbidity. During a prospective follow-up 271 patients were treated at our department between 1 April 1993 and 30 July 1996. The rate of perforating appendicitis was 3.7 %, and that of bland appendicitis was 19.6 %. The rate of perforating appendicitis did not differ significantly according surgeon, who decided to operate. However, the number of patients with bland appendicitis did differ significantly among different operators. There were also significant differences in the rate of wound infections. No correlation was found between the rates of perforating and bland appendicitis was not found. In summary the operator affects the quality of the surgical treatment in cases of suspected appendicitis by differences in the timing and performance of the surgical procedure.
