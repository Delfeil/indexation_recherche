Conservation of bone perfusion, protection of the soft tissue envelope and reduction of systemic stress by strengthening the host defence mechanism are general and essential aspects of a biological osteosynthesis. The minimal invasive operating techniques with the use of technical aids and tricks form the necessary presupposition for successful bone healing with a low complication rate. For an epiperiosteal, percutaneous plate osteosynthesis, the technique using a sliding tip and a manipulation handle is demonstrated.
