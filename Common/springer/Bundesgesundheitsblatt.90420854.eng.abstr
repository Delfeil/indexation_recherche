According to the Cosmetics Directive (Directive 76/768/EEC) a cosmetic product is def - ined as a preparation to be applied to the external parts of the human body with the "exclusive or main" purpose to clean, protect or keep them in good condition. This definition gives room for pharmacologically active substances to be added to cure/prevent unpleas-ant conditions like male pattern baldness, acne, hirsutism, cellulite and the development of wrinkels. Unlike drugs, where toxicological data and the proof of their clinical effectiveness have to be examined by a governmental agency, none of this is mandatory for products sold under cosmetic law. Whereas clinical experience with known drugs may suggest a dose range of safe use in cosmetics, this does not apply to new chemicals or herbal extracts which for whatever reason did not reach the level of marketing authorization.
