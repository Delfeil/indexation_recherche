New therapeutic approaches for the treatment of stroke require new strategies for early diagnosis, fast transportation to the hospital, immediate diagnostic procedures, recommendations for therapy and early rehabilitation. Systemic thrombolysis can only be performed in a setting of optimal infrastructure. The implementation of stroke units leads to a measurable improvement of long term prognosis i.e. significantly more patients may live independent after their stroke.
