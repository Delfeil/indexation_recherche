Neurological complications in clavicle fractures are rare. As a primary lesion, it is caused by the trauma itself. More often however, the neurological symptoms develop later by large callus formation that encroach on the costoclavicular space. A case report is presented of delayed injury to the brachial plexus due to clavicular fracture with non-union and callus formation.
