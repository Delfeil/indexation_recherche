Injuries of the spine in children rarely occur. They amount to about 0.2 % of all fractures and dislocation and to 1.5 to 3 % of all lesions of the spine. The younger an injured child is, the more likely it has sustained a lesion of the upper cervical spine. This spinal segment in comparison to adults is concerned more often and accounts for 50 % of all C-spine injuries. Important differences between the adult spine and the spine in the child disappear with the age of 10 years. Later diagnostics, classification and treatment correspond widely with the principles valid in adults. The knowledge of the normal shape and development of the spine are crucial in avoiding misinterpretations of X-ray films. Typical examples include the confusion of synchondrosis with fractures or of subluxations of the atlas and the C2/C3 segment with "true" instabilities. Relevant lesions always are accompanied by clear clinical symptoms. Specific injuries of the growing axial skeleton are lesions of the cartilaginous endplates and "fractures" of the synchondrosis.
