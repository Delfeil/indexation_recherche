 Recent studies have clearly indicated that the prognosis for asymptomatic post-infarct patients has improved in the last two years. This makes it more difficult to achieve a reliable identification of high-risk patients. The so-called "classical" risk stratification methods (longterm ECG, determination of the ejection fraction) are still important today for assessing the prognosis of post-infarct patients. Patients with normal test results from non-invasive methods have a good prognosis. The low positive predictive value, however, remains a problem which will also not be solved using new methods (heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity). Programmed ventricular stimulation may be the most suitable method for predicting arrhythmogenic events. However, it is an invasive method and may only be used in about half of the post-infarct patients, so that it is not suitable as a screening method. Whether it will be possible making use of non-invasive methods currently available to identify a population whose prognosis would be improved by using an implanted defibrillator remains to be demonstrated in future studies.
