Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is a rare but always life-threatening complication in patients with central nervous system lesions. NPE is evident if patients shortly after cerebral lesions suddenly develop pulmonary edema and other causes of the symptoms, such as aspiration of gastric content, congestive heart failiure and direct toxic exposure, are ruled out.
