Operative treatment for ruptures of the long biceps tendon still is discussed controversially. In the present literature the keyhole-technique is recommended according to favourable biomechanical conditions. In recent years refixation to the short biceps tendon was preferred. Now it is supposed that this technique may provocate subacromial impingement considering the loss of depression function of the long biceps tendon to the humeral head.
