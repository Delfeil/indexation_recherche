Cardiovascular events are the main cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease. Functional and structural alterations of the arterial system substantially contribute to the high cardiovascular mortality in these patients. Structural alterations of the arterial wall comprise intima-media thickening and atherosclerotic plaque formation. Moreover, mechanical vessel wall properties of large arteries are significantly disturbed. This is already observed in young patients. Reduced arterial distensibility impairs large artery cushioning function. This results in increased ventricular afterload promoting left ventricular hypertrophy and in reduced coronary perfusion. After renal transplantation, structural alterations of the arterial wall and disturbed mechanical vessel wall properties persist.
