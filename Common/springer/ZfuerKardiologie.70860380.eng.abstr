  Major systemicopulmonary collateral arteries (spca) frequently contribute to collateral lung perfusion in patients with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect or in children with tetralogy of Fallot. Since the surgical access to these vessels is difficult, corrective surgery may become impossible. We report our experience with interventional occlusion of spca in 10 patients. In these patients (age range 13 months-19.5 years) selective injections demonstrated a total of 27 spca. Sixteen of these were coil-occluded by interventional cardiac catheterization. Total occlusion was achieved in 15 cases, in one case we found a small residual shunt. Occlusion was performed using platinum coils (2 cases), Gianturco coils (11 cases) and detachable steel coils (4 cases, including 1 with prior incomplete occlusion by Gianturco coils). 4 patients required 2 interventional cardiac catheterizations. Complications occurred only in procedures that were performed with conventional coils (peripheral pulmonary embolizations of platinum coils in 2 patients, dislocation of the delivery catheter with a partially extruded coil to the descending aorta in 1 patient). Operative ligation had to be performed in 6 spca, since those vessels were not suitable for interventional occlusion. The remaining 5 spca were left unoccluded, since they were of minor hemodynamic relevance due to a subsequent decrease in size. At the end of the following-up period corrective surgery had been completed in 8 of our 10 patients. In the remaining 2 patients corrective surgery is planned in the near future. According to our experience interventional occlusion of spca is a major improvement in the management of a selected cohort of patients with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect or tetralogy of Fallot. The introduction of detachable steel coils facilitates the embolization of those vessels.
