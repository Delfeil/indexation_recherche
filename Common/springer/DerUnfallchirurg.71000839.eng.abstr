A 37-year-old woman had intensive care for 105 days and artificial ventilation for 72 days because of a lung transplantation and multiple postoperative complications. She developed severe heterotopic ossification of both shoulders, the right elbow and both hip joints. Owing to complete joint stiffness, she was immobilized and unable to eat or drink without help. Operative treatment was performed in two procedures. The right shoulder and right elbow were operated on first; the right hip and later the left hip were operated on after recovery from the previous surgical procedures. After 22 months, there was a good functional result; the patient took part in all activities of daily life and was pain-free. The present knowledge on heterotopic ossifications is summarized, as well as possible prophylactic measurements.
