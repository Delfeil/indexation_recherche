  Introduction: In this study systolic and diastolic function in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and intractable complaints to medication were investigated before and after a mean of 7 months after myectomy. Methods: Investigations in 19 patients with HOCM included echocardiography, Swan-Ganz-thermodilution-catheter and radionuclide-angiography. Results: Myectomy resulted in a reduction of the intraventricular gradient at rest (40.1  +/-  43.3 versus 7.6  +/-  12.0 mm Hg, p <= 0.005) and under provocation (92.4  +/-  67.1 versus 21.3  +/-  26.5 mm Hg, p <= 0.001). Echocardiographically determined basal septal thickness was reduced (24.9  +/-  6.3 versus 20.1  +/-  6.8 mm; p <= 0.05) and diastolic diameter increased (40.4  +/-  5.2 versus 44.8  +/-  7.2; p <= 0.05). Exercise tolerance increased from the maximally achieved 64.5  +/-  19.2 to 89.5  +/-  24.0 W (p <= 0.001). Symptomatic status (NYHA) improved (1.7  +/-  1.4 versus 2.8  +/-  0.3 (p <= 0.001). Systolic parameters showed at rest an increase in isovolumetric contraction time (65  +/-  39 versus 112  +/-  50 ms, p <= 0.01), in time to peak ejection (109  +/-  40 versus 188  +/-  42 ms, p <= 0.001), and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (72  +/-  12 versus 64  +/-  11%, p <= 0.01). Analysis of regional ejection fraction revealed a significant reduction of ejection fraction in the basal septal region (p <= 0.05). Increase of global and regional ejection fraction under exercise was still preserved. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was significantly reduced at rest (11.8  +/-  3.8 versus 8.6  +/-  2.4 mm Hg, p <=0.05) as well as under exercise (27.0  +/-  7.1 versus 20.4  +/-  6.8 mm Hg, p <= 0.01), whereas left ventricular enddiastolic volume index (63  +/-  19 versus 72  +/-  17 ml * m-2, p <= 0.05) was significantly increased. Conclusions: In patients with HOCM, myectomy reduces intraventricular gradient, increases exercise capacity, and is accompanied by improved diastolic function parameters, while systolic function parameters are generally reduced.
