Dorsal tension band fixation is a wide-spread technique of finger arthrodesis. When using a resorbable PDS-suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed. Aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup-in-cone-procedure. Freeze-preserved fingers with thread tension band fixation using the PDS-material (series 1), the same fixating method on formaldehyde preserved fingers (series 3), freeze-preserved fingers with a standard tension band fixating (wire loop, series 2) are load in a four-point-bending in the direction of palmarflexion. From 6 degrees onwards the wire-tension-system requires a higher torque for bending, but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture. The examination shows that the thread-tension-band method by PDS-loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces.
