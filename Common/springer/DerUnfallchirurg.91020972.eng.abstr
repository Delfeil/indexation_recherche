Up to the present only few cases of spontaneous healing of juvenile bone cysts after pathological fractures were published. Most authors will not accept the possibility of a "healing fracture" in bone cysts because of missing documentation. In our clinic we could observe spontaneous healing of a juvenile bone cyst of the tibia after a pathological fracture in a ten-year old boy. Therefore healing of bone cysts after fracture is proven. On the other hand healing of bone cysts following conservative treatment after a fracture is not sure. Conservative treatment depends on the localization and type of the fracture. We recommend nonoperative treatment of first pathological fractures in small-sized bone cysts. This kind of treatment can be especially advised for young patients up to the tenth year because there are only few complications in fracture healing and a relatively high recurrence rate following operative treatment. In case of a refracture there are better conditions for fracture healing after surgery.
