A total of 222 urogenital specimens were investigated with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction (Amplicor test) for the direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis. The results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique. Using cell culture a urogenital C. trachomatis infection could be detected in 72 of 222 patients. The Amplicor test yielded a positive result in 83. Referred to the detection rate of the Amplicor test and that of the cell culture, sensitivity was 91.2% for the test sensitivity and 79.1% for the cell culture. The specificity of both techniques was 100% when the specimens for which neither both nor either one of the tests gave positive results were considered. In accordance with other studies, this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will supersede cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of C. trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital chamydial infections.
