Callus distraction in the treatment of severe midfacial hypoplasia/atrophy may offer new therapeutical possibilities. Between May 1998 and March 1999, six patients underwent a subtotal Le Fort I-II osteotomy with subsequent distraction via a haloborne distractor (RED). Five patients suffered from CLP, four patients were totally or almost edentulous in the upper jaw. Corrections of sagittal discrepancies were possible in all cases (distraction 16-31 mm). No case of increased velopharyngeal insufficiency was seen. In one patient the halo had to be refixed. Three patients suffered from tension-like pain in the soft palate during distraction. Follow-up studies suggest the necessity for overcorrection of 20% in edentulous senior patients. Callus midfacial distraction is a promising new alternative to conventional orthognathic surgery in severe cases.
