A measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants. The implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the eardrum and the inner ear. A defined signal within the frequency range of 0-5 kHz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is  measured by a probe microphone. Displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of 5 nm. The transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal. This system can be used to evaluate the sound-transmitting properties of different middle ear implants excepting other influences, such as surgical techniques. This work details the measurement system and demonstrates basic influences on the sound-transmission of middle ear implants.
