Background and objective. The cupula in the ampulla of the semicircular canal, like the tectorial membrane in the cochlea, forms the essential link in transferring endolymph fluid movement stimuli to the hair cells. Clear understanding of physiological cupula movement only started evolving towards the end of the 1970s. Currently, the cupula is assumed to adhere firmly to the ampulla wall, with diaphragm-like displacement in the central section and at the base.
