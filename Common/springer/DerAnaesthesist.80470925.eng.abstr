The official German guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called Robert-Koch-Institut, twelve years ago. The recently published official "guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence. The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official German guidelines. The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia.
