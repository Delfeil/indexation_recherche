 Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) may occur in up to 70% of septic patients and multiple organ failure patients. Typical clinical signs of CIP are the difficulty to wean the patient from artificial respiration, a symmetrical flaccid quadriparesis/-plegia that is more pronounced in the distal parts of the limbs, reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes, and muscular atrophy. This article describes and discusses the clinical and electrophysiological features and clinical outcomes, physiopathological concepts, therapeutic implications, and the complex differential diagnosis of CIP from a neurological point of view, focusing on disorders of the nervous system and myopathic abnormalities. The data available in the literature were reviewed and compared to our own findings in order to deduce a clinical definition of CIP. It is a particular aim of this work to emphasize the crucial importance of electrophysiological investigation and monitoring in the classification of the nature and extent of neuromuscular disturbances in critically ill patients.
