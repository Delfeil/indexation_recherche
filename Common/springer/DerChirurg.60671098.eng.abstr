 The basis for aggressive treatment of patients with severe head injuries is swift and efficient diagnostic management of trauma victims. The best imaging modality for the detection of relevant intracranial injuries is cranial computed tomography. The use of CT is also justified from an economic point of view. CT is supported by plain X-ray and for special purposes by Doppler sonography, digital subtraction angiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Further indications of imaging procedures are the evaluation of the time course of intracranial injuries, treatment monitoring and the detection of secondary complications.
