 To optimise the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis. This includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials, human placenta and the rat model. The most important role in this concept is played by the placenta. It supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis. As to availability, handling and costs the placenta is superior to animal models and has replaced them almost completely in our educational concept.
