Computer-assisted prefabricated skull implants of pure titanium as a bone replacement material have been used in 22 departments since 1994. Our experience with 104 implants includes clinical aspects (indication; tissue quality; surgical technique; patient guidance), but also geometric and material-specific parameters (acquisition, transfer, and evaluation of CT data; construction; manufacturing; cleaning; postoperative use of radiologic techniques). While the clinical aspects are responsibly defined by the respective surgeon, the geometric and material-specific parameters of individual implants have to comply with the laws on medical products. Therefore, the prospective documentation for each implant includes: helical CT acquisition parameters; geometric data of the computer-based skull model and implant; the cleaning procedure; and the individual marking. Medically specified pure titanium is processed by milling only so that neither purity nor structure is impaired. A specially developed milling technique guarantees the fabrication of all constructed elements down to fine details of 50 µm. Considering the necessary radiologic follow-up of defects after tumor surgery, all patients in our hospital undergo postoperative MRI examination, partly with preoperative documentation as an intraindividual control. Such comprehensive documentation and quality assurance is essential for techniques of prefabricated bone substitution. Hand in hand with scientific research and clinical application, these formal criteria have to be elaborated and fulfilled for the respective techniques. The successful determination of specifically adapted MRI sequences goes even one step further: spin-echo sequences minimize inhomogeneities of the magnetic field induced by the titanium implants and enable accurate postoperative documentation and diagnostics especially in the follow-up after tumor surgery.
