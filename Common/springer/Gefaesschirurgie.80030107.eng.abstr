 A case history of a 60-year-old man presenting with a contained rupture of the left common iliac artery is presented. After successful exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm using a covered stent, mycotic rupture at the aortic bifurcation necessitated emergency aortic ligation and axillobifemoral grafting. Endovascular stent grafts are not suitable for treating pseudoaneurysms of a potentially mycotic origin.
