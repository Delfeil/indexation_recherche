 This study was performed to evaluate the role of endogenous endothelin-1 (ET-1), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in patients with left-to-right shunt and pulmonary hypertension. Further objectives were to study a possible feedback mechanism between ANP and ET-1 and to examine the influence of ANP on cGMP plasma levels. Finally, the role of these hormones in oxygen-mediated pulmonary vasodilation was examined.
