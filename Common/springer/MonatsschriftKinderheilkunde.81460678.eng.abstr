We report on two girls with atypical, self-remitting central precocious puberty and their subsequent development until (near) final height. Both showed thelarche prior to chronological age 4 years and an accelerated progressive bone maturation (delta bone age/delta chronological age 1.86 and 3.21, respectively). In patient 1, the hormonal find-ings were not typical for central precocious puberty (Gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulated LH/FSH ratio 0.54, estradiol 14 pg/ml). In patient 2 the hormonal results were borderline (stimulated LH/FSH ratio 1.0, estradiol <5 pg/ml). During the next 5 years a spontaneous arrest of pubertal development was seen in patient 1 until normal puberty started at age 10 years (menarche 12.7 years). Patient 2 showed a complete regression of pubertal signs until now (age 8 years). Both patients were not treated. Patient 1 reached a normal adult height (168 cm). The remaining growth potential of patient 2 is favourable (height SDS for bone age).
