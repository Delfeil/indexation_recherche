The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises a heterogenous group of nine hereditary connective tissue disorders, characterized by hyperelasticity of skin and hypermobility of joints to differing extents. The skin is easily injured and wound healing is delayed. The majority of EDS patients belong to EDS-types I-III. The pathogenesis in these cases is not known, although recent data suggest a role for collagen V. In contrast, the etiology of EDS-types IV, VI and VII has been found. While EDS IV is caused by a mutation in the collagen III gene, in EDS VI a mutation in the lysyl hydroxylase gene is present. In EDS VII, the underlying defect is a mutation in the collagen I gene. The EDS-types V, VII and X are very rare; their symptoms resemble those of EDS-type II.
