Objective: To examine to what extent the condition of chronic malnutrition of anorexia nervosa leads to changes of the heart.  Methods: Using 1- and 2-dimensional echocardiography we collected parameters to determine the size and function of the heart, and the thickness of the myocardium of 81 patients with anorexia nervosa. Thereover we investigated the occurence of mitral valve prolapse and pericardial effusion. In a cross-sectional sample of hospitalised patients we put the measured heart parameters in relation to body weight. Subsequently we conducted a longitudinal study of 44 of these 81 patients to find out how these parameters changed with increasing body weight.  Results: In the cross-sectional sample we found that the parameters always remained within normals, provided normals were related to body weight. This also implied to patients with extreme underweight. A mitral valve prolapse was detected in 6 of 81 patients (7,5 %), and a pericardial effusion in 16 of 81 patients (20 %).  In the longitudinal study the cardiac parameters increased with increasing body weight, but to a lesser degree than weight. There were no changes for the mitral valve prolapse whereas the number and size of pericardial effusion clearly decreased.  Conclusion: Chronic malnutrition in anorexia nervosa leads to significant changes of the heart. These are, however, less significant than weight loss. The mitral valve prolapse ist not dependent on underweight. With increasing body weight most of the cardiac parameters tend to normalize albeit at slower pace than body weight. None of these changes were dangerous for the patients even for those with extreme underweight. Therefore a specific treatment was never found to be necessary.
