The choice of appropriate anaesthesia in a more or less seriously ill patient requires detailed information on the risk and tolerance of each specific anaesthetic regimen. The objective of this prospective, randomised clinical trial was to test the hypothesis that three regimens of general anaesthesia - neurolept-(NLA), balanced (BAL), and intravenous propofol anaesthesia (IVA) - differ with regard to safety and comfort. The criteria for the intraoperative safety and postoperative comfort of the patients were the incidents, events and complications (IEC) that required medical treatment as well as the evaluation of postoperative complaints by the patients according to the IEC list and patient questionnaires of the German Society of Anaesthesia and Critical Care Medicine (DGAI).
