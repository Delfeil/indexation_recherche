In the industrial Western world, 8 % of the population suffer from urogenital discomfort. Epidemiologic studies show that the incidence rises with age. In light of the steadily increasing longevity in the female population, clinically manifested irregularities such as urogenital atrophy, recurrent urinary tract infections, irritable bladder, and incontinence pose a challenge to the attending physician. To this day, urinary incontinence in later life is considered "normal" and "caused by old age." However, among other age-related reasons, the main cause of this disorder is postmenopausal hormone deficiency. Thus, following thorough diagnostics, pathological changes in the urogenital tract can often be reduced or altogether eliminated by simple conservative measures such as topical hormone administration, which rapidly enhance patients' quality of life. The present study gives an overview of the physiology of urogenital aging and the diagnostic and therapeutic means available to physicians to alleviate patients' discomfort.
