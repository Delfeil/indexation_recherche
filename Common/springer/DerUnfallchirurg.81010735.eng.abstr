We reviewed 77 conservatively and 164 operatively treated cases of rupture of the long head of the biceps documented in the literature. Refixation offers a small but relatively constant improvement of flexion and supination power and thus reduces the number of cases with remaining light or marked weakness by one third. Deformity by the slipped muscle can be corrected effectively. As complications are uncommon surgery should be recommended to young and active patients and should at least be offered to less active patients. Thirteen patients were re-examined after operative repair for distal biceps tendon avulsion and 277 reported cases were reviewed. After conservative management (n = 20) the power of flexion remains reduced by 30 %-40 %, that of supination by more than 50 %. The loss of flexion power, as well as the deformity can be nicely diminished by attachment of the distal biceps to the brachialis muscle (n = 22). There are no complications documented regarding this procedure. The anatomic reinsertion (n = 248) additionally reduces the loss of supination power to 0 %-25 %, but bears a higher risk of complications. The double-incision technique (n = 105 of 248) does not necessarily decrease this risk. There are as many nerve injuries reported as with the single-anterior approach. Additionally we are faced with the problem of radioulnar synostosis. The use of suture anchors provides a nice way of fixation of the tendon but does not facilitate the approach to the tuberosity. The distal biceps tendon rupture should be treated operatively. The adequate method of repair is to be determined individually.
