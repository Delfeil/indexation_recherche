Recent reports have indicated the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase to play an important role in tumorigenesis. Activation of this enzyme is known to prevent progressive shortening of the end of the chromosomes, or telomeres, and hence to be critical in maintaining chromosomal integrity. The telomerase expressing cells require immortality. Supported by recent findings which suggest that telomerase activity is expressed in virtually all cancers but not in normal tissues, except those of the germline, hope grew up toward a potentially important new therapeutic target in the fight against cancer. An emerging hypothesis is that the inactivation of telomerase results in the death of immortal cells. If telomerase activation represents a tumor-specific feature, (gene) therapeutic applications would become most promising in regard to an effective anticancer therapy, possibly with limited side-effects. However, most recent studies report on telomerase activity to be also expressed in normal, non-neoplastic tissues as well as in non-neoplastic hyperproliferative lesions. The questions whether telomerase activity is tumor-specific or associated with (physiologic or pathologic) hyperproliferation is intriguing and remains to be clarified.
