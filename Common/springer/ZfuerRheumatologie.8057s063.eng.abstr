 In contrast with the situation just a few years ago, the most widely accepted model for the pathogenesis of FMS now invokes CNS mechanisms like nociception and allodynia rather than pathologically painful muscles. The levels of platelet serotonin and CSF substance P appear to be abnormal in directions that could logically amplify pain perception. The extent to which these mechanisms are unique to FMS will be critical in determining the direction that future research should take. Certainly, a better understanding of the cause of FMS could represent an important step toward the development of more effective therapy.
