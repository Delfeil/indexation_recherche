Three short, respectively promising self-rating scales used for the assessment of emotional states, especially depression, were examined: a visual analogue scale with only five items, a short version of the so-called "adjectives list" and a differentiated scale for recording current emotions, possible susceptibility to them and the ability to express them. We checked statistical parameters of item analysis, reliability, validity and time course measurement. This study was carried out with depressive inpatients (n=35) at the time of admission and 4 weeks later in beginning remission. All three scales proved to be reliable (Cronbach- between 0.48 and 0.97) and partially very valid instruments (concurrent validity between 0.04 and 0.87). In order to improve the documentation of a beginning response to therapeutic efforts, separate recordings of depressive subsyndromes such as "impetus" or "positive emotionality" seem to be quite promising approaches.
