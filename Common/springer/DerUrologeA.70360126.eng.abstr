The clinical relevance of de novo Renal Cell Cancer was compared in chronic hemodialysis patients and renal allograft recipients. Clinical course of these patients was followed for 15 years. 21 of 788 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy were suffering from renal insufficiency at the time of surgery. Evaluated data included clinical symptoms, tumor histology and clinical course. 19 patients received chronic hemodialysis treatment. 7 patients demonstrated stable function of the allograft. 92 % of patients receiving hemodialysis treatment did not show metastasis and none died of renal cell carcinoma. On the contrary, 71 % of patients who underwent renal transplantation showed advanced tumor disease or metastasis. 3 patients have died of RCC. Aggressive tumor growth of RCC requieres close follow up in patients who received a renal allograft.
