The surface area and the microporosity of bone regeneration materials influence their chemical and biological properties. Therefore, the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters (pores < 1 µm) of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study. The analyzed hydroxyapatites were of synthetic, bovine, and phytotroph origin. The tricalcium phosphates and the bioglasses included only synthetic materials. The gas adsorption of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric N2/Kr system (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics). Additionally, for materials with a specific surface area (> 2 m2/g) the pore size distribution was evaluated by the BJH-method. Two of the materials evaluated astonishingly large dimensions of the specific surface area (BioOss 79.7 m2/g, Algipore new 14.6 m2/g). A medium surface area was found for Algipore old (4.9 m2/g) and Interpore200 (2.64 m2/g). All other included materials showed only small sizes of the specific surface area (Ceros80 1.8 m2/g, Ceros82 1.31 m2/g, Cerasorb 1.2 m2/g, Biobase 0.7 m2/g, Endobone 0.7 m2/g, Perioglas 0.6 m2/g, Allotropat50 0.23 m2/g, Biogran 0.2 m2/g). The materials with large and medium sizes of the specific surface area evaluated the following pore diameters: BioOss 2-50 nm, Algipore new 2-100 nm, Algipore old 5-50 nm, Interpore200 2-100 nm. Pore sizes less than 2 nm were not found in relevant numbers. The materials BioOss, old and new Algipore, and Interpore200 contain a large interconnecting mesopore system (diameter < 1 µm). For the materials Biobase, Endobone, Perioglas, Allotropat 50, and Biogran this cannot be assumed. The materials Ceros80, Ceros82, and Cerasorb evaluated a specific surface area between those and might include only a small part of these interconnecting pores. An influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested.
