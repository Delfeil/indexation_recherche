Methods. To assess the occupational exposure of the anaesthetist to anaesthetic gases, a total of 1 German and 25 Swiss hospitals were investigated. A Brüel & Kjær Type 1302 multi-gas monitor was used to measure concentrations of nitrous oxide and halogenated anaesthetic agents in the anaesthetist's breathing zone. Measurements were performed during 114 general anaesthetic, 55 of which were in patients under 11 years of age. In these 55 patients, the influence of various factors on the exposure (time-weighted average concentrations) was estimated by comparing different data groups. The efficiency of the applied scavenging equipment was examined by surveying the exhalation valve with a leak detector (type TIF 5600, TIF Instruments, Miami). Results. Sessions with patients under 11 years of age revealed much higher anaesthetic gas exposures compared to older patients. The concentrations of nitrous oxide were on average threefold (Fig. 1), those of the halogenated anaesthetics fivefold higher (Fig. 2) for the younger patients. In 11- to 16-year-old patients the exposure level was the same as in adult patients. The measurements showed a reduction of 85% in exposure if an efficient scavenging system (i.e., no waste gas discharge to room air through the exhalation valve) or lower fresh gas flow were used (Fig. 4); 42% of the inspected scavengers were inefficient, and reduced the exposure on average by only 30%. In operating theatres with a ventilation rate of at least ten air changes per h, the measured concentrations of anaesthetic gases in the inhalation zone of the anaesthetists were reduced more than 50% compared to poorly ventilated rooms (Figs. 4 and 5). The use of tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway (LMA) anaesthesia resulted in a reduction of 80% in exposure compared to standard face masks if efficient scavenging was used. The exposures during sessions with inefficiently scavenged Bain coaxial systems or unscavenged semi-open delivery systems of the Jackson-Rees type were tenfold higher than with scavenged rebreathing circuit systems (Fig. 6). During anaesthesia with IV or double-mask induction, the average levels of inhalation anaesthetics were reduced by about 80% compared to inhalational induction with standard masks (Fig. 7). The anaesthetist's working technique is a very important factor that strongly influences the concentrations. Poor work practices, like lifting off the face mask with anaesthetic gas flow turned on, increased the exposure of the anaesthetist and other operating room personnel drastically, even if the other conditions (scavenger and room ventilation) were good. Discussion. The exposure levels of anaesthetic gases are generally higher during anaesthesia in children up to 10 years of age than in older patients. Nevertheless, the measurements showed that exposure during paediatric anaesthesia can be kept below the recommended limit (8-h TWA in Switzerland) of 100 ppm nitrous oxide and 5 ppm halothane or 10 ppm enflurane or isoflurane. Causes of high exposures were particularly high fresh gas flows often applied without scavenging or together with inefficient scavenging devices and the high part of mask anaesthesia and inhalation induction with a loosely held mask. To achieve an effective reduction of occupational exposure, well-adjusted and maintained scavenging systems and low-leakage work practices are of primary importance. As leakage can never be completely avoided, a ventilation rate of at least ten air changes per h should be maintained in operating rooms and rooms where anaesthesia is induced to keep down concentrations of waste anaesthetic gases. High exposure during mask anaesthesia and inhalation induction can be prevented by further measures. Using a LMA instead of a standard mask reduces the exposure to the same level as endotracheal intubation.
