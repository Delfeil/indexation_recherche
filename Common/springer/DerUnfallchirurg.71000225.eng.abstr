Between 1972 and 1994 21 children up to 14 years old sustained complex pelvic trauma treated at the Trauma Department of the Hannover Medical School. Sixteen of the 17 survivors were followed at an average of 8.9 years. In 8 patients operative treatment of the disrupted pelvic ring (external or internal fixation) was performed; in 8 patients the treatment was conservative. At follow-up 9 patients (56%) were pain-free; 4 reported slight, 2 moderate and one patient severe pain (at rest). There were no neurological deficits. Four patients had disturbed micturia, and 1 had bowel incontinence. Radiological evaluation showed anatomic reconstruction of the pelvic ring in 9 cases (56%). Residual maximum displacement of 12 mm was detected in 2 patients. In 3 cases osteoarthritis or ancylosis of the SI joint was present. In 3 cases a clinically not disturbing heterotopic ossification was found. Another 2 cases had ossifications of the pubic symphyses. A post-traumatic acetabular dysplasia was detected in 2 cases; a hypoplasia of the hemipelvis was seen in 3 patients. In a retrospective analysis of the primary radiographs, 13 pelvic lesions were not detected during the primary clinical course (sacral fracures, lesions of the triradiate cartilage). Despite this finding the pelvic outcome was rated good and excellent in 10 patients (63%), moderate in 1 patient (hypoplasia of the hemipelvis, and poor in 5 patients (31%) with severe pain or urogenital disturbancies. The maximum ratings in social reintegration was given to 9 patients, a medium rating to 7 patients. All patients were socially integrated.
