Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral agent of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children throughout the world. Highest hospitalization rates are seen in the second and third month of life. Young infants, especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency, are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe RSV disease. Specific therapeutic options for RSV are limited.
