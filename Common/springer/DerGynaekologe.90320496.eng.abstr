Even if Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever - bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations - he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections, to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of childbed fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures, especially the hand disinfection. He has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or putride lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health-care personnel act as vehicles. As a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection, he noticed that generally only the weakend organism of the patient is involved as an infection target. The impact of his doctrine not only made him "saviour of the mothers" but also justifies to regard him as "father of the obstetric infection prevention" if not even as the founder of the modern science-based hospital hygiene.
