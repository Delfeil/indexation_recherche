MR-guided LITT (laser-induced thermotherapy) is currently being evaluated for its effectiveness in clinical oncology. MR-guided LITT is defined as a minimally invasive technology based on the effects of the applied Nd-YAG laser on tumorous tissue. Due to specific characteristics of the laser-induced coagulative effect, online monitoring via MR thermometry is possible and extremely precise. In a period of 6 years 335 patients suffering from malignant soft tissue tumors were prospectively treated via MR-guided LITT. We evaluated the local tumor control rate, the rate of complications and the survival data from the clinical and MRI follow-up. Our results prove that MR-guided LITT results in a extremely low rate of side effects and an effective tumor control rate higher than 95%, depending on the size of the lesion. It is concluded that this therapeutic concept is of clinical value for patients with primary and secondary liver cancer, malignant lymph node involvement, abdominal recurrent tumors and tumors of the head and neck.
