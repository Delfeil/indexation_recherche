The prevalence of rheumatic forefoot arthritis is estimated at 85-95 %. Early synovitis of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints is frequently neglected or overlooked. The disease leads to depression of the forefoot arch, dislocation of the MTP joints and hallux valgus with severe metatarsalgia. Operative treatment may give good results in 77-91 % of cases. Our preferred treatment consists of resection arthroplasties for the smaller toes and use of Swanson spacer for the big toe, extensive capsular and tendon release from the dorsal approach, reduction of the first metatarsal bone, relocation of the extensor hallucis tendon and postoperative corrective dressing for 6-12 weeks. With this technique, we obtained 36 good results out of 46 forefoot reconstructions, the mean observation period being 30 months.
