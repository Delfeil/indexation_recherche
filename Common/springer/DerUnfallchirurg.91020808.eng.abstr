We report on a posttraumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk, something which is rather rare. The injury was caused by blunt chest trauma following a car accident. Computed tomography could not find the brachiocephalic lesion. In patients with fractures of the upper ribs after blunt chest trauma, angiography should be done to exclude severe injuries of the aorta and brachiocephalic vessels.
