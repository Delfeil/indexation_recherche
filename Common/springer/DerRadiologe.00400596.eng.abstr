Pathological conditions of the pharynx requiring diagnostic imaging (CT and/or MRI) are in increasing frequency malformations, inflammation, trauma, dysphagia and neoplasia. For neoplastic diseases CT/MRI are of major importance for pretherapeutical staging. Furthermore they should be used routinely in tumor follow up. Primary goal of diagnostic imaging of the pharynx is the analysis of submucosal structures that are not visible by clinical means. The close cooperation between otorhinolaryngology and radiology is necessary to define size, extent of tumor spread, infiltration and/or destruction of vital structures (vessels, nerves), leading to an individual therapeutic regimen.
