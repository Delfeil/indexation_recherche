The loads acting on internal spinal fixation devices were measured for different activities in ten patients using telemeterized bisegmental implants. The highest loads were found for walking and lateral bending of the upper body while standing. When bending forwards the upper body, the fixator loads were only slightly altered. The forces and moments were not higher during sitting than during standing. Therefore, sitting should be allowed for patients with instrumented spines as soon as getting up is allowed. The forces and moments in the fixators were often altered due to anterior interbody fusion. Especially in patients with degenerative instability, the implant loads were higher after anterior interbody fusion than before. Braces were not able to markedly reduce the fixator loads. Therefore, it does not seem helpful to brace patients after mono- or bisegmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
