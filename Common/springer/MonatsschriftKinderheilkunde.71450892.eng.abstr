Of the distinct syndromes and associations featuring overgrowth, some still await further characterization. Major distinguishing marks between these overgrowth disorders include craniofacial abnormalities, statomotoric and mental retardation, and muscular hypotonia. We describe a 3-year-old girl with tall stature, facial dysmorphy, severe mental retardation, and an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 22/del(22)(q13.1;q13.33). The chromosome 22q13 deletion syndrome was only recently reported by Nesslinger et al. [1] as a new nosologic entity.
