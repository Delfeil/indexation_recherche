Arthrofibrosis is a severe complication of trauma and surgery around joints with loss of motion due to an excessive fibrotic response in the repair process. Both the cause and mechanism of arthrofibrosis remain unclear. We investigated fibrotic tissue samples taken from 18 patients (average age: 32.5 years; range: 18-64 years), who underwent arthrolysis of the knee joint because of symptomatic arthrofibrosis following ligament injuries, fractures, or corrective soft tissue surgery. The mean interval between trauma and arthrolysis was 16 months. All samples were stained with HE. Monoclonal antibodies (Ki-67, anti-PCNA, anti-factor VIII) were applied for immunohistological localization of proliferating cells and of small vessels. Synovial tissue samples from knee joints without any detectable pathology served as controls. Arthrofibrotic tissue from the anterior joint compartment revealed synovial hyperplasia and a chronic inflammatory reaction with lymphocytes and plasma cells as well as a perivascular fibrotic enlargement. Immunostaining showed hypervascularity and an increase in proliferating cells. The stratum fibrosum of the joint capsule was enlarged by hypocellular fibrosis. Samples taken from the posterior capsule showed less cellularity and vascularity than samples from the anterior compartment. The histological findings indicate that arthrofibrosis is a fibroproliferative disorder. The chronic inflammatory process may play a crucial role in the mechanism of arthrofibrosis. A strong immune response may lead to attraction and activation of inflammatory cells and may stimulate resident cells in the synovial tissue to proliferate. Thus, arthrofibrosis may be similar to other systemic or local fibrotic disorders. However, the stimuli which triggers the fibrotic response remains unknown. Further studies are necessary to define the cause and mechanism of arthrofibrosis in order to make progress in preventing and treating this disorder.
