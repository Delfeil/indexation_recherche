 The numerical topographical dental findings of 29,862 adult patients from several German dental practices were evaluated. Taking into account the age-dependent loos of teeth the various decades were investigated separately for increased incidences of identical findings. The total number of teeth comprising the dental findings in the form of tooth number classes was a first-line criterion aiding classification. In accordance with an underlying binominal distribution, a raised incidence of identical dental findings was found both in patients edentulous jaws or few residual teeth and in patients with largly complete dentition. The raised incidence was confined to a few standard findings in each of these high or low tooth number classes. However, more than 50% of all cases were either in the intermediate tooth number classes, in which raised incidences of >= 0.2% generally do not occur, or showed correspondingly rare constellations of findings in the high or low tooth number classes. In more than half of all cases, there was therefore a numerical topographical dental status which can be used in identification with a matching probability of >= 99.8%. Dental findings which occur less frequently can be arranged clearly according to tooth number classes.
