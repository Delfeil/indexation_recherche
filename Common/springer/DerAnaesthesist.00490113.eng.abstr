Background: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder, triggered in susceptible individuals by inhalation anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine. Because of its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93,6%) as well as the genetic heterogeneity of MH disorder, the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) following the European-MH-Group is considered to be the "Gold Standard" for phenotypical determination of predisposed patients. On the other hand mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) are tightly linked with MH susceptibility. After detecting a C1840T-mutation (Arg614Cys) in the RYR1 gene in one individual of a large MH family, we searched for this mutation in the remaining family members and determined the concordance with IVCT.
