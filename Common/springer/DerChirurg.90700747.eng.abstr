 Radiology of the pharyngoesophageal segment in patients with dysphagia relies on evaluation of both morphology and function. Video- or cineradiographic techniques are necessary. Retention of contrast material above the cricopharyngeal muscle can be due to small pseudodiverticula or true diverticula. Both phenomena are due to dysfunction in the pharyngoesophageal segment. To develop into a true diverticulum it is probably necessary to have a congenital defect between the muscle layers in the pharyngoesophageal segment.
