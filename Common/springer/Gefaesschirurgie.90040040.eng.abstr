 In the last 7 years we have performed 220 infrainguinal vein bypasses associated with critical limb ischemia. All patients were prospectively controlled in a follow-up program 3 - 72 months postoperatively. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with diabetes mellitus (35%, group 1) and patients without diabetes mellitus (65%, group 2). There was no difference in sex, age or localization of distal anastomosis (supra- or infragenicular) between the two groups. The primary and the primary-assisted patency rates were not statistically different after 60 months. There was a significant difference in limb salvage. The limb salvage of group 1 was 75% after 60 months, while the limb salvage of group 2 was 95% (P = 0.0045). The rate of major amputations was significantly higher in group 1 (15.6%) than in group 2 (4.9%, P = 0.007). The indication for amputation was persistent foot infection.
