The aim of this study was the scintigraphic visualization of points of segmental irritation resulting from reversible articular dysfunction. Because of increased cellular metabolism as a result of muscular hypertonus, scintigraphic visualization of these points should be possible with 99mTc-MIBI. This radiopharmaceutical is localized in cells, depending on the metabolism.
