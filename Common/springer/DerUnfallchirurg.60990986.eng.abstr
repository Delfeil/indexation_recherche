A modified method of access to the upper thoracic spine is presented based on a case report. The third and fourth thoracic vertebral bodies can be reached by partial upper sternotomy. This approach takes the local anatomic situation into account, thus avoiding the typical complications of complete sternotomy and reducing the postoperative pain. Closure was done using biodegradable sutures, achieving satisfactory stabilisation and a low rate of complications. In only 4 of 130 cases (3%) did a superficial wound infection occur. There was no case of deep infection, osteomyelitis or dehiscence of the sternum.
