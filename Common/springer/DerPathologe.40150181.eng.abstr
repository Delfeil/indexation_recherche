Cytological, biopsy and autopsy findings in a patient suffering from massively metastasizing adrenal angiosarcoma are reported. Histogenetic typing of the tumour initially manifestating itself by osseous and liver metastases was problematic with regard to its partially epithelioid structure and its positivity upon cytokeratin immunostaining. Of relevance for the correct typing was the finding that the tumour cells in addition exhibited positivity for vascular markers. This case confirms literature data according to which cytokeratin expression not infrequently may be encountered in endothelial neoplasms and which by no means should lead to exclude such a tentative diagnosis.
