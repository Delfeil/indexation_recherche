Abstract.  Tap water iontophoresis is the therapy of choice in hyperhidrosis palmoplantaris. Therapeutic regimens, however, vary greatly. The aim of the present study was to develop an optimized therapeutic scheme. The main methodologic parameters subjected to systematic experimental study included the effects of current polarity, the duration of a single treatment session, the addition of electrolytes to the tap water and the treatment interval during maintenance therapy. The following procedure is proposed. During the initial phase, treatments are carried out three times weekly for 10 min each time. The anode is kept on one extremity until normhidrosis is reached on this extremity. Then, polarity is changed until sweating is reduced to normal on the other extremity (constant polarity). In the subsequent maintenance phase, patients are treated at intervals of 6 - 8 days for 10 min each time. Polarity is switched from treatment to treatment (alternating polarity). Plain tap water is used without additives.
