Capillary hemangiomas occur rather ubiquitously, but extremely rare within the wall of blood vessels. For this reason the authors report on a small capillary hemangioma of sinusoidal type. It has been observed fortuitously within the wall of the portal vein at autopsy of a 79-year-old woman. Based on site and structural characteristics the benign neoplasia is supposed to have developed from a local malformation, probably an abortive liver anlage.
