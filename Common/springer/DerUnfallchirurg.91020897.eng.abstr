The case of an 39-year-old man is presented, who sustained a bilateral locked fracture dislocation of the shoulders occurring during an epileptic seizure. Radiographs demostrated a compression-fracture of the anteromedial aspect of the humeral head bilaterally (reversed Hill-Sachs-lesions). Additionally, fractures of the lesser and greater tuberosity were diagnosed at the right site. Open reduction and internal fixation was performed in both shoulders within 12 hours. 6 months later the patient has no complaints with a free range of motion. Diagnostics, treatment and result are discussed in context with the literature.
