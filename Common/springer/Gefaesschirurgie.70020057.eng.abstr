 Regarding the etiology of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), congenital bone and/or fibromuscular anomalies, positional characteristics and trauma play a role. Signs and symptoms are extremely variable, depending on whether the compression of the plexus, of the artery or of the vein is predominant. In the clinical examination the AEST test is of utmost importance. The visualization of the subclavian artery and vein by DAS in different positions is mandatory. Less than 5% of the patients show a subclavian artery aneurysm, but 76% have obstructions of digital arteries. Every patient, must undergo a neurological examination including the measuring of the proximal ulnar and median nerve conduction times. Anatomical lesions of the subclavian artery, reduction of the proximal nerve conduction times and high-degree venous compression as well as disabling pain during the night with abuse of analgesics are absolute indications for the decompression of the neurovascular bundle. This is achieved by the transaxillary exarticulation of the first rib together with a cervical rib and fibromuscular bands if present. The results of the primary operation are favourable: completely painfree 85%, markedly improved 12%, unchanged or worse 3%. The results of operations for persisting and recurrent TOS are disappointing: completely painfree 48%, markedly improved 31%, but 21% unchanged or worse.
