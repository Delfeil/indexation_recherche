We describe granulomatosis disciformis Miescher in a 57-year old female patient with typical clinical manifestation: disc-shaped plaques with slight central sclerosis and lesions resembling necrobiosis lipoidica and granuloma anulare. Histology revealed an infiltrate mainly composed of macrophages and lymphocytes and small foci of necrobiotic collagen and of new collagen formation. We review the literature on granulomatosis disciformis and nosology, concluding - as do most authors - that granulomatosis disciformis is a characteristic variant within the spectrum of cutaneous noninfectious granulomatous disease lying in between generalized granuloma anulare and necrobiosis lipoidica.
