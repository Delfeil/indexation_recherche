CT- or MRI-guided stereotactic procedures should be a standard in a modern neurosurgical unit. Analysing 71 cases the indications and results of stereotactic neurosurgery are presented. In 53 patients stereotactic serial biopsies of different intraaxial lesions were performed, in 5 patients a spontaneous haemorrhage of the basal ganglia was removed by lysis with r-tPA. In 3 patients suffering from hydrocephalus due to diencephalic cysts a cystventricular shunt device was implanted. In 3 patients an intracerebral abscess was aspirated and drained. A stereotactic guided craniotomy and excision of small deep-seated lesions was performed in 6 cases. The accuracy of stereotactic tumour biopsies was 88.7 % in our series, in accordance to other authors. The stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics. The stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal invasiveness and low operative risk. The aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r-tPA or urokinase. With stereotactic guidance small, deep-seated intraaxial lesions can be well localized and removed.
