We report a locally recurrent retiform haemangioendothelioma (RHE) on the right great toe in a 40-year-old woman. There was a secondary soft tissue lesion on her right lower leg. Histologically, primary lesion, local recurrence and the secondary soft tissue lesion (soft tissue metastasis?) showed identical features. Long, arborizing, neoplastic blood vessels were lined by CD31 and factor VIII-positive, monomorphic endothelial tumour cells; focally solid tumour areas, papillae and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature B and T lymphocytes were noted. The concept and the group of low-grade malignant vascular neoplasms is discussed, with special emphasis on inclusion of RHE in this category.
