 The incidence of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with arterial hypertension is up to 96% and is about 10 times higher than in normotensives. Predictors for an increased ventricular arrhythmogenic risk are left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), impaired left ventricular function with enlarged enddiastolic and endsystolic volumes as well as late potentials which in case of LVH increased from a 7% to 18% incidence. Especially the Simson criteria fQRS and RMS seem to characterize patients at risk. In addition a longer duration of hypertension in conjunction with a higher muscle mass index and a larger amount of couplets and non-sustained ventricular tachycardias, documented by Holter recording, are determinants of life threatening arrhythmias.
