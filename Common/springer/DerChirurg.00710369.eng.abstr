Abstract.  Across centers, transfusion can vary eightfold for the same mediastinal drainage after adult cardiac operations. Excessive blood drainage resulting in increased transfusions occurs in 29 % of patients. Various strategies have been proposed to decrease bleeding and allogenic transfusion requirements in the perioperative period of heart surgery. Blood conservation methods were reviewed critically. Avoidance of preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations, the use of autologous blood, and adherence to a strict transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogenic transfusions. Perioperatively, maintenance of normothermia contributes to improved hemostasis.
