Background: Intensive epidemiologic and pathophysiologic research during the past 30 years successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of cot death (Sudden Infant Death, SID). However, several differential diagnoses with probable consequences for siblings should be taken into consideration, even if a thorough postmortem examination failed to reveal an adequate cause of death. Most important are cardiac arrythmias, especially the syndrome of QT - prolongation (Romano-Ward-syndrome). The poor prognosis may be improved by prophylactic therapy with beta-blocking agents.
