A case of a 16 years old young man with meningococcemia, septic shock and purpura fulminans is presented. The clinical course was complicated by ischemia of both lower legs and feet as well as both cheeks. After successful restoration of circulation, the lower legs remained ischemic and loss was imminent. Therefore, fibrinolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was started: Both lower legs and feet could be preserved. All of the toes of the right foot, however, had to be amputated.
