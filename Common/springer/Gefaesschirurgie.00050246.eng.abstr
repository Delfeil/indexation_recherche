 Proximal anastomotic pseudoaneurysm following aortobifemoral grafting is a rare event and, due to the potential for rupture, operative repair is mandatory. We report on a 72-year-old patient with a 6.7 cm anastomotic pseudoaneurysm following aortobifemoral bypass grafting for aortoiliac occlusive disease 10 years earlier. The aneurysm was repaired endoluminally with insertion of a bifurcated stent graft that was introduced after bilateral femoral artery cut-down. The limbs of the stent graft were placed into the previous prosthesis. The patient was well 3 months after the operation, and contrast-enhanced spiral CT scanning demonstrated complete exclusion of the aneurysm. Since reoperation for a proximal anastomotic pseudoaneurysm is hazardous, endoluminal repair may be a therapeutic alternative for selected patients.
