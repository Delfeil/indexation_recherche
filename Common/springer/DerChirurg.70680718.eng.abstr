 The unreamed femoral nail (UFN) system, with its numerous proximal interlocking options, allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns. Sixty-six fractures, 5 cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures, 2 limb shortenings and 1 lengthening (monorail technique) and 3 cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the UFN from July 1994 to December 1996. The fractures were analysed according to the AO classification. We found 31 polytrauma patients with an mean ISS of 21.8 and a mean PTS of 25.4. Most of the multiply injured patients (n = 26) were stabilised with the UFN primarily. Follow-up of 44 patients ranged from 4 to 18 months postoperatively. According to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in 34 % of cases, good in 36.3 %, poor in 20.4 % and bad in 9 %. Average fracture healing time was about 9.8 weeks.
