Major abdominal surgery often leads to a marked sympathoadrenal stress response with high concentrations of plasma catecholamines, hypertension, and tachycardia. We compared the effects of sufentanil-propofol with fentanyl-propofol anaesthesia in a controlled, randomised, double-blind study of 18 ASA I-II patients aged 23-64 years undergoing major abdominal surgery. Study parameters were haemodynamics (heart rate [HR], arterial [ABP], central venous, and pulmonary arterial pressures, cardiac index [CI]), arterial catecholamine concentrations, and the median frequency of the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum.
