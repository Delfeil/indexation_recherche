Questionnaires were mailed anonymously to 150 German shock wave centers. Twenty questions addressed the following areas of interest: - Facilities of the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) center (technical, personnel, laboratory, etc.) - Cooperation at ESWL center with referring urologists - Laboratory facilities versus actual metabolic work-up. The return rate was 114 of 150 (76 %). Surprisingly, at 58 % of the centers the average number of treatments is less than two per day. In 30 % of the centers only chemical stone analysis is done! The final conclusion was that ESWL has largely replaced the causal metabolic work-up and subsequent metaphylaxis as a symptomatic measure against urolithiasis.
