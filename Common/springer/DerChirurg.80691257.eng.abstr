 Noma is an ulcerative-necrotizing gingivo-stomatitis eventually leading to severe destruction of the midface, including lips and cheek, maxilla/mandible, nose and rarely the orbit. The defects are usually unilateral. Children from economically underdeveloped countries are predominantly affected. Medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate, which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time. Predisposing factors include malnourishment, immunosuppression, and poor oral hygiene. Forty-eight noma patients were surgically treated in Sokoto, Nigeria during October 1997 by an Interplast Germany team sponsored by AWD Stiftung Kinderhilfe. Interdisciplinary surgical strategies and results, e. g. ankylosis release, local flap coverage and 12 pedicled musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi island flaps, as well as a noma classification (NOMAC), are presented.
