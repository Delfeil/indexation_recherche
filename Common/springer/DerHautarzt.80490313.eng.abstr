A 55-year-old man with CREST syndrome had marked telangiectasias of the palms, the face and the gastrointestinal tract. The latter caused slow bleeding and anemia. The telangiectasias were definitely associated with the CREST syndrome. Iron substitution was sufficient therapy. If a need for further therapy should arise, endoscopic sclerotherapy could be employed. Gastrointestinal bleeding in the CREST syndrome is rarely described, probably because it is unrecognized or interpreted as hemorrhagic gastritis. The possibility of gastrointestinal telangiectasias and concomitant bleeding should be kept in mind in cases of CREST syndrome.
