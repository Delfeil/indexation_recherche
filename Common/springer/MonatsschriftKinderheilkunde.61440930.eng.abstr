 The kangaroo method has become an integral part of the care of premature babies. With this method children are placed nakedly on the undressed chest of their parents and covered with a blanket for one to several hours per day. The skin contact offers the premature babies tactile, auditory and kinaesthetic stimulation at the same time. The kangaroo method is ideally suited for the support of child-parent-relationship. The parents are given an early chance to build up a bond with their child. The high degree of satisfaction expressed by parents has led us to offer the kangaroo method to a large group of parents and babies. Having extended the application of this method of postnatal care we studied the effect of the kangaroo method on the vital parameters of premature infants. We examined 20 babies with a mean birth weight of 1204 g and a mean gestational age of 30,6 weeks. During the application of the kangaroo method in the morning the babies had a mean pulse rate of 157.2 bpm and a mean oxygen saturation of 95.1 % (as determined by pulse oxymetry). During the control period in an incubator the mean pulse rate was 152.0 bpm and mean oxygen saturation was 95.7 %. The rectal body temperature rose by a mean of 0.4  °C during the kangaroo method and by 0.2  °C in the incubator. However, the babies reaction to a change of environment differed from day to day and from child to child. This contribution discusses the origins and dissemination of the kangaroo method. The current state of knowledge on the subject is summarized. Finally practical hints are given.
