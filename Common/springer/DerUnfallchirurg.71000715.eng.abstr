Pathological fractures and osteolyses with impending fractures of long bones impose a severe problem in patients with advanced cancer. For palliative treatment between June 1993 and October 1995 intramedullary nailing was performed in 19 patients with 13 femoral, 7 humeral and 1 tibial lesions; AO unreamed nails were used for this purpose (unreamed femur nail UFN with or with spiral blade for femoral lesions and unreamed tibia nail UTN for humeri and tibia). Stabilization was achieved without severe complications; full weight bearing of both femora and humeri (while using crutches) was allowed. Simultaneous and bilateral nailing was done. Follow-up until death due to advanced cancer demonstrated no implant failure and improved quality of life as well. Unreamed intramedullary nailing seems to be a minimally invasive procedure with a low complication rate for palliative treatment of (impending) pathological fractures in advanced cancer.
