 Necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Formerly, surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard. Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis. A considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation. Nevertheless, surgical treatment is indicated in patients with infected necrosis and in sterile necrosis if multiorgan failure persists over a limited period of time despite maximum intensive care therapy. Pancreatic resection should be abandoned for surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis, as results with regard to morbidity, mortality and long-term outcome are unsatisfactory. Today the surgical standard is careful digital necrosectomy, which must be followed by either postoperatve drainage, repeated open lavage or continuous closed lavage. In experienced hands, all three procedures provide similar results with regard to morbidity and mortality.
