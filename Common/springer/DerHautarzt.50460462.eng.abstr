Cryosurgery with liquid nitrogen led to total or partial success in 64% of 336 patients with keloids and in 82% of 58 persons with hypertrophic scars. In 11% and 3% of the patients, respectively, the results were disappointing. In 19% and 12%, patients broke off the painful and long-term therapy. Nonetheless, in view of the results of other therapeutic methods, we prefer cryosurgery (either as monotherapy or combined with corticoids or conventional surgery) for keloids. For hypertrophic scars, however, the therapy is restricted to exceptional cases since nearly all lesions regress spontaneously within a few years.
