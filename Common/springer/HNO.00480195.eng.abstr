Several investigations prove that monaural acoustic deprivation induces detrimental changes in the auditory pathway. So far the major interest focused on degenerative processes on the deprived side, while effects on the contralateral untreated side were not taken into consideration. This ontogenetic study investigates effects of early monaural acoustic deprivation on the functional development of the acoustically evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) in the Mongolian gerbil. Young gerbils were deafened by a single intracochlear application of neomycin sulfate. The ABR development on the contralateral side differed in a late developmental period from that of normally hearing animals. These changes persisted until adulthood. Between day 55 and day 90 a significant 5 dB decrease of the ABR thresholds and a significant shortening of the interpeak latency II-V occured. The results confirm that a complete monaural deprivation during the sensible or critical period leads on the contralateral side to plastic or compensatory changes in the auditory brainstem.
