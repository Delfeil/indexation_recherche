 Greater saphenous vein is the preferred graft material for below knee bypass. In the case of absent autologous vein, modified human umbilical vein (HUV) is used less frequently than synthetic grafts. To assess long-term graft patency and degenerative changes, the second generation of modified human umbilical vein graft was chosen for below knee femoropopliteal bypass when autologous vein was not available. Fifty-five below knee femoropopliteal bypasses were performed in 54 patients. In most cases the operation was performed for critical leg ischemia, disabling claudication, or severe acute ischemia. In 25% of patients, previous ipsilateral bypass had been performed. In no case was ipsilateral greater saphenous vein suitable. Early graft thrombosis occurred in 30.9% of patients. In 65%, revision with thrombectomy was successful. Primary (secondary) patency rate was 55.2% (75 .5%) with a limb salvage rate of 88.3% after 48 months. After a maximal follow-up of 57.4 months, duplex scanning could not demonstrate significant aneurysmal graft degeneration. Good graft patency and duplex scan results justify continued use of the second generation of modified human umbilical vein in peripheral bypass surgery when autogenous vein is not suitable.
