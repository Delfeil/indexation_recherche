We report on a child with pili trianguli et canaliculi. This hair shaft abnormality belongs to a heterogeneous group of diseases which are included under the synonym uncombable hair. The diagnosis was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, revealing hair shafts with a characteristic longitudinal groove. In addition the girl suffered from atopic eczema and tooth anomalies. Our findings suggest that this disorder could represent a tricho-odontal subtype of ectodermal dysplasia.
