 In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction, late potentials are often constantly present in the signal-averaged electrocardiogram. After myocardial infarction and ventricular fibrillation, late potentials are not constant in many cases. However, these patients show functional changes of late potentials during acute ischemia during PTCA or during heart rate acceleration due to atrial pacing. Use of selective signal-averaging late potential analysis during exercise is possible. Exercise tests can provoke ischemia and heart rate acceleration. The Holter ECG allows the detection of functional changes during daily life activity. Initial studies indicated that patients with dilatative cardiomyopathyprone to ventricular tachycardia might be identified with greater sensitivity. The results show that late potentials can be provoked especially in patients with ventricular fibrillation or fast ventricular tachycardia and no late potential at rest. Functional late potential analysis might improve risk stratification in patients prone to sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias.
