Background. Many of the previous studies which dealt with the influence of cataract surgery on intraocular pressure, were performed retrospectively and based on heterogenous groups of patients. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to prospectively assess the effect of phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular-lens (IOL)-implantation on intraocular pressure (IOP) under standardized conditions in patients with and without open-angle-glaucoma.
