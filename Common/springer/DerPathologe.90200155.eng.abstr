The rising numbers of tissue samples for securing a diagnosis has led to a multitude of tissue samples in pathology institutes. Criteria and measures for ensuring the quality of histological diagnosis have been developed. Corresponding rules for the organization of the tissue sampling up to their processing do not yet exist. Suspicion of interchanged samples occurs much more often than it actually happens; however, it is important to be aware of the possibility so as to inform the clinician and to eliminate any possible causes of the confusion. The civil and penal consequences of such an interchanging, the subsequent "incorrect" diagnosis and the therapeutic measures are secondary compared to the potentially dramatic consequences for the patient. Important causes for an interchanging and possible preventive measures are presented.
