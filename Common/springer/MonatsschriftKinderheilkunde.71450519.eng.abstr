Background: In 1986 Prof. H. Olbing (University of Essen Pediatrics Department), supported by Prof. G. Stickler (Mayo Medical School, Minnesota), introduced a 4-weeks clinical skills lab for all students (annual class 250), based on self-instruction by means of computer-assisted, interactive, audiovisual learning materials, models, bedside teaching and seminars on special topics (partially peer-guided). Each year 14 chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching. The peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills. Each tutor is active during 4-5 skills lab periods, and in each period he/she coaches two groups of two students each. During the bedside teaching phase each group examines and presents four patients.
