We report the first case of prurigo pigmentosa in the German literature. For over a year, a 16-year old white girl developed an immensely pruritic symmetrical reticular, papulo-vesicular eruption on the trunk, axillae and pubic region. Histologically a superficial  perivascular spongiotic and lichenoid  inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed. Topical corticosteroids and  systemic antihistamines had no effect. Systemic corticosteroids and diaminophenylsulphone (DADPS) produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences. Healing  occurred only after 4 weeks of systemic- minocycline.
