 Vascular infections after percutaneous endovascular procedures are rare. We report a case of bacterial arteritis following PTA and stent implantation into an iliac artery. It was complicated by septic embolization, ipsilateral empyema of the knee joint and formation of an infected false aneurysm. Contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus is likely to be the cause. The treatment included resection of the infected arterial segment, removal of the stent, and autologous reconstruction.
