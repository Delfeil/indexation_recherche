The relation between nutrition and sport has been studied extensively during recent decades. Nevertheless, research interest was focused mainly on the role of dietary macro- and micronutrients as ergogenic aids. Today, there is increasing support for the hypothesis that the nutrient status also has relevance for the prevention and rehabilitation of systemic and muscular stress induced by intense physical exercise. The increase in muscular stress is indicated by the rise in creatine kinase and myoglobin; the systemic stress is associated with characteristic immunological and hormonal changes and an acute-phase response. During and following exercise, the course of cytokines (especially interleukin 6) and acute-phase proteins (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen) as well as cortisol levels are an indirect measure of the exercise intensity and the individual ability to cope with physical stress. It has been shown that the dietary intake and, consequently, the systemic or intracellular concentrations of minerals such as magnesium and zinc, vitamins with antioxidant capacity (vitamin E, C, E, and  carotin), and the composition of fatty acids can be related to the exercise-induced stress response. Therefore, this review deals specifically with the impact of these nutritional components on the reduction of sports-specific muscular damage and systemic stress, especially under the aspect of increased losses during and following intense physical exercise.
