Since the first clinical experiences with the fully implantable programmable distraction nail nearly ten years ago, the system has been improved in Munich and meanwhile used in 26 patients. During the first 10 cases there has been highest interest in the reliability of the system, while in the following the expansion of indications was more important. At the thigh a good indication beside shortening is the combination of shortening and axis deviation, even if the center of deviation is located near to the knee joint in the supracondylar area. According to preoperative planing the deformity correction can be done acutely while the lengthening procedure follows postoperatively automatically at night-time. If the stabilization with an intramedullary nail is possible, large bone defects can be treated by bone transport using this system also. The fully implantable intramedullary nail has proved its variable functions in cases of large bone defects combined with shortening of the femur. The system is able to perform the bone transport at first and the lengthening procedure automatically without any further operation thereafter.
