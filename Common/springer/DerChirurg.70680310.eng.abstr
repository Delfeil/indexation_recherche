Incisional hernias are a common complication following abdominal surgery. However, when performed correctly, the techniques utilized for direct hernia repair, Mayo's closure and plastic covering of the defect appear to be effective in the management of primary hernia closure. The recurrence rates of 30-50 % continue to represent a significant challenge in the initial management of incisional hernia repair. Fortunately, there is evidence that, with correct preparation of the patient and with correct anatomical reconstruction, better results can be achieved. Also, the use of strictly applied technical skills in combination with standardized operative techniques may help to eliminate further complications and recurrences. In addition, the application of mesh or cutis transplantation to reinforce the attenuated tissue has also been shown to reduce the recurrence rate. With the diligent application of the above measures, as well as of new concepts, which at present include a promising technique called tension-adapted closure, there may be positive developments in the treatment and management of incisional hernias.
