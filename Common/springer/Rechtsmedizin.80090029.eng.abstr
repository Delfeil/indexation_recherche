 Voluntary and/or accidental shots are mostly fired at low-angles. At short or large distances the bullets have a destructive impact, but not falling bullets which have been fired vertically or near to vertical. In these cases the destructive energy is dependent on the form, mass and the "parachute velocity" of the projectiles. When a fired bullet has reached the maximum height its velocity increases from zero to the constant parachute velocity which is especially influenced by the form of the bullet and whether the projectile falls nose or base first. Injuries by falling bullets are very seldom in peacetime, but two cases with equivalent injuries are reported.
