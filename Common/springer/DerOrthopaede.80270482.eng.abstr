Various therapeutic options have been proposed in the treatment of femoral head necrosis ranging from conservative management to total hip arthroplasty. Since microsurgical techniques are routinely used in orthopaedic surgery, the importance of revascularization has increased in recent years. Vascularized bone grafting as well as various osteotomies have been considered for the stages II and III according to Ficat and II, III and IV of the criteria of the ARCO system respectively, which also bases on MRI-findings. We investigated the results of 80 patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head treated with a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft, perfused by the A. circumflexa ilium profunda, between 1988 and 1996. Mean follow-up was 5,6 years. The evaluation was based on the harris hip score, clinical and radiological examination as well as a subjective assessment using a VAS (visual analog scale). The clinical results according to the harris hip score were good or excellent in 86,1 %. These results correlate with the subjective assessment of pain and of the hip joint function with an average of 7,9 points using the VAS (max. 10 points). Unchanged radiological appearance over the follow-up period was observed in 47,5 % using the ARCO criterias. Reviewing the studies using vascularized grafts, about 50 % of the patients with a stage II and III according to Ficat and II, III and IV of the ARCO respectively show an unchanged stage of the disease 5-6 years after the procedure. Therefore, transplantation of a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft possibly offers the chance to intervene causally in the course of the disease with only little alteration of the biomechanics of the hip joint.
