 At present there is neither an completely inert biomaterial available, nor does a universal test exist which objectively evaluates biocompatibility. One reason is the individuality of the host, especially with regard to the inflammatory response. Inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto-oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation. The present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen-impregnated polyester prosthesis (Dacron) in Balb/c mice on experimental days 1, 18, 38, and 322. Serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target. Specific polymer antibodies, enhanced by repeated implantations, could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day 322. These antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating. The antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete Freund's adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day 1. Results suggest that specific polymer antibodies, reflecting an inflammatory response, might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses.
