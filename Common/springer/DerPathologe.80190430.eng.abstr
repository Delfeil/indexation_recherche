Univentricular hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations. We report a case of a 34-year old male with single ventricle, two atria, tricuspid atresia, large atrial septal defect, complete transposition and pulmonary valvar stenosis. There were no signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension. Intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years. Conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation. The patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession, family and some sportive activities like squash. He died of sudden cardiac death. The malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development. Special features are emphasized. Clinical picture, prognosis and therapy are reported from literature. During the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results. Special morphologic constellations, as in our case, may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life.
