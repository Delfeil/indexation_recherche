Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate knowledge, practices, and opinions on tobacco and oral health among dentists of the Berlin Dental Association using a questionnaire. Materials and methods: Questions focussed on smoking habits, knowledge about oral malignancies and premalignancies and practical approaches to screening for oral mucosal diseases and other associations of tobacco with oral changes. The questions related to risk factors and behavioural counselling for patients and associated constraints. Results: Of a total of 4000 questionnaires sent, 483 were received for evaluation (12.1%). Of respondents 9.5% were regular smokers. The median number of oral malignancies observed was 3. Knowledge about some associations of oral changes such as wound healing was adequate. A total of 93.1% of respondents would refer patients with oral lesions. Only 35% take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26.6% explain the side effects of tobacco. Some 73.4% believed that the dentist could play a role in anti-tobacco counselling. Limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti-tobacco counselling. Conclusions: This study shows that there still is a considerable need for improvement of knowledge and for provision with effective anti-tobacco teaching material. Since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti-tobacco counselling, adequate programmes in Germany should be inititated and followed up.
