Is refixation of a osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) fragment of the knee an efficient method? The series is composed of 43 patients operated on with a technique of fixation. There were 13 adolescents and 30 adults. 39 OCD were located in the medial condyle, and  4 in the lateral condyle, all were located in the weight bearing surface of the condyle (zone 2 and 3 of the Cahill and Berg classification). We used either an arthroscopic technic or an open technique. The base of the fragment is cleared of all soft tissue, cancellous bone is impacted in the freshened bed and the fragment is stabilised with one or two cannulated compression screws. Average follow-up was  5,5 years (1 to 20 years). We used the Hughston rating scale for OCD. In Juvenile OCD, results are: excellent or good: 77%, fair or poor: 33%. In Adult OCD, results are: excellent or good: 47%, fair or poor: 50%, failure: 3%. Significant relationship exists between the results and the size of the fragment, the localisation, the quality of fixation, and the length of follow-up. There is also relationship between quality of cartilage, stability and size of the fragment. If healing does not occur with conservative treatment, fixation can be attempted if the fragment volume is bigger than 1 ccm, is in the weightbearing zone and is partially or totally detached in the weight bearing zone. Delay in treatment leads to preoperative degenerative changes which adversly affect the results.
