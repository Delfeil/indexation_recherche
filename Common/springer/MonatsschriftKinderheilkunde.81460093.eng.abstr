Williams-Beuren syndrome is a multiple malformation syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable expression. Characteristic symptoms are congenital heart defects (typically supravalvular aortic stenosis in combination with peripheral pulmonary stenoses), primary psychomental retardation, distinct facial features, malformations of the kidney or urinary tract, failure to thrive and gastrointestinal symptoms in infancy and early childhood, and short stature (50% of patients). We report on a young man with Williams-Beuren syndrome in whom the dignosis was made late at the age of 24 years.
