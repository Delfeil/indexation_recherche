Background: Picosecond laser intrastromal photorefractive keratectomy (ISPRK) aims at achieving a flattening of the central cornea by plasma-mediated tissue evaporation without affecting the anterior or posterior corneal layers. We investigated the laser-induced tissue effects to establish a functional relationship between laser parameters and tissue removal and to assess their influence on the healing process and long-term refractive changes.
