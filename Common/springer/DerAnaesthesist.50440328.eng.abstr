In animal models authors have dealt with the question of whether hypotension alone can cause an acute-phase response even in the absence of marked blood loss and trauma. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which was employed in the animal models, is also used to induce hypotension in humans. Since no data are available on human subjects plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an important mediator of the acute-phase response, were studied in patients during SNP infusion for induction of hypotension.
