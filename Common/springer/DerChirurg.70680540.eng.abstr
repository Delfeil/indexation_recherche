Gastric involvement of Hodgkin's disease is very rare and preoperative diagnosis is difficult. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman, who had an ulcerating tumor of the antrum, which was revealed as carcinoma by endoscopic biopsy. A gastrectomy with D2-lymph node dissection was performed. In the pathological specimen Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed because of microscopic detection of typical binucleated Reed-Sternberg cells. Although the patient refused additive chemotherapy, she is still disease-free after 12 months of follow-up.
