The case of a 60-year-old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma (T3N2CM0) and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented. On one side, the sacculus opened atypically into the left vestibular fold. The sacculus is a physiologic part of the roof of Morgagni's ventricle, the size of which can vary greatly. These canal-like structures can be the point of origin of cysts, laryngoceles, mucoceles, and pyoceles.
