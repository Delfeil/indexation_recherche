 The aim of the study was to compare the clinical outcome after AV node radiofrequency current ablation and pacemaker implantation in patients with permanent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The study consecutively included 19 patients with permanent (male n = 15; 55  +/-  13 years) and 45 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (male n = 31; 60  +/-  13 years). Clinical evaluation before and 1 year after ablation included the symptoms and the self-assessed state of health. Before ablation, both groups reported with a similar frequency about tachycardia (permanent n = 15; paroxysmal n = 2) and palpitations (permanent n = 5; paroxysmal n = 19). Patients with permanent (n = 7) atrial fibrillation had more often breathlessness than patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (n = 2), whereas dizziness/syncope was more often reported by patients with paroxysmal (n = 35) than with permanent arrhythmia (n = 8). Ablation improved symptoms in patients with permanent (89%) as well as with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (84%). The self-assessed state of health described as good had not patient before ablation and 63% patients with permanent and 47% with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after ablation. There were no differences for the studied parameters between patients with permanent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
