 The aim of this study was to determine the impact of prolonged single lung ventilation and intrathoracic insufflation of CO2 during computer-enhanced totally endoscopic bypass grafting on biventricular myocardial function.    Methods: Transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively in 20 patients undergoing the above mentioned operation. At distinct time points during the intervention, a cine-loop of both ventricles was registered employing a mid short axis view. Simultaneously, oxygenation parameters as well as electrocardiographic data and intrathoracic CO2 pressure were taken. Wall motion analysis was done postoperatively.    Results: With increasing duration of single lung ventilation, significant regional and global biventricular hypokinesia was detected. This was accompanied by a decrease in PaO2 and a marked increase in intrathoracic CO2 pressure. These alterations disappeared after weaning from extracorporeal circulation and reconstitution of double lung ventilation.    Conclusion: These results show that computer-enhanced coronary artery bypass grafting leads to significant alterations in intraoperative biventricular myocardial function. This can be due to either an impact on oxygenation during single lung ventilation or due to intrathoracic CO2 insufflation. However, in our group, these alteration showed only small clinical relevance.
