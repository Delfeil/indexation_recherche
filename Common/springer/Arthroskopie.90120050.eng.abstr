The principle of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for rheumatoid arthritis consists in specifically concentrating a drug (photosensitizer) in the synovium. Subsequent activation of the photosensitizer by means of a laser leads to a cytotoxic effect. The practicability of PDT was tested in an animal model of IgG-induced arthritis in rabbits. Photosan-3, 5-aminolevulinic acid and BPD-MA were administered intraarticularly or intravenously. In this model, concentration of the photosensitizer in the synovial lining cells, the lymphoid infiltrate, and the skin was seen. After laser irradiation a selective demarcation and destruction of the synovium by prior administration of Photosan-3, not constant by BPD-MA and without therapeutic effect by 5-aminolevulinic acid, was observed. In contrast, bradytrophic tissues such as cartilage, meniscus, and ligament structures were changed neither macroscopically nor microscopically in all series. PDT thus offers ideal preconditions for minimal invasive treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases because of its selectivity and efficacy. Photodynamic laser therapy can be considered a new method in the surgical treatment of inflammatory disease of the synovial membrane.
