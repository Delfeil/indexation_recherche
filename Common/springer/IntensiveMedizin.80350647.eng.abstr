 Recent advances in the treatment of acute renal failure, e.g., continuous hemofiltration or dialysis, provide excellent compensation of uremia even in unstable intensive care patients. The clearance required to stabilize plasma urea concentration on a desired level depends on body weight and on normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR). In a patient with 75 kg body weight and a nPCR of 1.5 g/kg/d, continuous dialysis providing an urea clearance of 25 ml/min results in a steady state urea concentration of 100 mg/dl. Using intermittent hemodialysis, daily treatment is required to achieve this excellent level of uremia compensation. Currently, there is no consensus as to desirable steady-state level of plasma urea in anuric intensive care patients. However, a randomized study recently demonstrated that the mortality rate in intensive care patients with acute renal failure dialyzed daily was half that of patients treated every other day. If a more intensive hemodialysis treatment improves outcome, initiation of hemodialysis has also to be reconsidered. Hemodialysis should be started as soon as the steady-state plasma concentration of urea desired during the treatment is exceeded.
