  The high rate of coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality needs preventive intervention. Several studies have documented the effectiveness of LDL-cholesterol lowering in CAD primary prevention. The West of Scotland Prevention Study resulted in risk reduction by about one third through LDL-cholesterol lowering. The data indicate that specifically patients at high risk benefit from lipid reduction. High risk patients have besides high LDL-cholesterol one or more additional risk factors such as family history of premature coronary artery disease, hypertension, smoking, low HDL-cholesterol or diabetes. Therapy primarily aims at life style changes, secession of smoking and weight reduction as well as dietary changes to achieve LDL-cholesterol levels of 115-175 mg/dl (3-4.5 mmol/L), depending on the individual risk constellation. This strategy allows to reduce the number of patients needed to treat in order to prevent one CAD event (56 in isolated hypercholesterolemia) to 14-24 in high risk persons, approaching the number (n=13) known for effective lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.
