Full thickness defects of the articular cartilage rarely heal spontaneously. While some patients do not develop clinically significant problems from chondral defects, most eventually develop degenerative changes associated with the cartilage damage over time. Techniques to treat chondral defects include abrasion, drilling, tissue autografts, allografts, and cell transplantation. The senior author has developed a procedure referred to as the "microfracture". This technique enhances chondral resurfacing by providing a suitable environment for tissue regeneration and by taking advantage of the body's own healing potential. This technique has now been used in more than 1400 patients. Specially designed awls are used to make multiple perforations, or "microfractures", into the subchondral bone plate. The perforations are made as close together as necessary, but not so close that one breaks into another. Consequently, the microfracture holes are approximately three to four millimeters apart (or 3 to 4 holes per square centimeter). Importantly, the integrity of the subchondral bone plate is maintained. The released marrow elements form a "super clot" which provides an enriched environment for tissue regeneration. Follow up with long term results of more than 8 years have been positive and very encouraging.
