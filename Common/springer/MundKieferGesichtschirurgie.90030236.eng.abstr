Infections of the oral mucosa have become important with respect to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), particularly as opportunistic infections. In the first part of this overview the epidemiologic, clinical and therapeutical aspects of the HIV infection are addressed. By the end of 1998, WHO had registered  2 million cases of AIDS globally and 33.4 million HIV infections were estimated. Every day 16,000 new infections occur worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region which has been affected most. By the end of 1998, 18,000 cases of AIDS were registered in Germany, with an estimated 50,000--60,000 HIV infections. The majority of new infections was registered among homosexual men; however, heterosexual transmissions are increasing. Antiretroviral combination therapies had an impact on the clinical course of HIV infection, affecting both mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy is monitored by determination of the viral load in plasma and CD4+-cell counts. Triple therapy resulted in longer survival and a reduction in opportunistic infections. Oral opportunistic infections are also markedly reduced after the introduction of combination therapies. Combination therapies require stringent compliance and are often accompanied by serious side effects.
