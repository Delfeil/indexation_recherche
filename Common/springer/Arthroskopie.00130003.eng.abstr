The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint. Its origin is at the lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle and the insertion is located in the posterior part of the intercondylar area. The posterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles. From a functional point of view, one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur. The anterior fibers insert in the anterolateral part of the tibial insertion zone. These fibers become tense when the knee is flexed. The posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended. The main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type I collagen positive dense connective tissue. The longitudinal fibrils of type I collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type III collagen positive fibrils. In the center of the middle third region, the structure of the tissue varies from the typical structure of a ligament. In this region, the structure of the tissue resembles fibrocartilage. Oval-shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils. The femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral apophyseal enthesis. Near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia there should be various mechanoreceptors which might have an important function for the kinematics of the knee joint. The blood supply of the PCL arises from the middle geniculate artery. The ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a periligamentous network. From the synovial sheath, the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a transverse direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network. The distribution of blood vessels within the PCL is not homogeneous. We detected three avascular areas within the ligament: Both fibrocartilaginous entheses of the PCL are devoid of blood vessels. A third avascular zone is located in the central zone of fibrocartilage of the middle third region.
