We report the case of a 33-year-old man after knee luxation and disruption of a popliteal artery, which was missed after repositioning at the first clinic. Eighteen hours later complete discontinuity of the popliteal artery was confirmed by arteriography and an immediate reversed, end-to-end autovenous graft was interposed under general anesthesia with anterior and posterior fasciotomy prior to blood flow restoration. Forced diuresis with a diuretic mixture and balanced fluid intake were used, and the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit on the 10th postoperative day in good condition with normal diuresis.
