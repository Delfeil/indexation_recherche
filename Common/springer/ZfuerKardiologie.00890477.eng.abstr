 Chronic pulmonary hypertension and septic lung failure display different clinical features resulting in severe disturbances in the pulmonary circulation. In these diseases, the pulmonary bloodflow is impaired by a pathologic constriction of blood vessels that may lead to right ventricular overloading as well as serious worsening of gas exchange mainly caused by ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Various mechanisms deteriorating the vascular function may induce both an irreversible and a reversible contraction of pulmonary vessels, respectively. Two pharmacological approaches exist to reduce the vascular resistance:...
