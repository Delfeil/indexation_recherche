In recent years, a more precise neurobiological knowledge has been gained concerning the various cellular parameters which mediate successful peripheral nerve regeneration, and also those which prevent repair of damaged nerve fibre pathways following traumatic injury to the the central nervous system (CNS). On this basis, a range of experimental therapeutical approaches for promoting axonal regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury have been developed in animal models. Such intervention strategies focus on the molecular inactivation of glial-associated growth-inhibitory factors and on the application of trophic molecules and cellular substrates which enhance the postlesional regenerative potential of intrinsic CNS neurons. At the present, these experimental therapies cannot be transferred to the clinical situation for the treatment of spinal cord injured patients. This overview briefly summarizes current progress in the neurobiology of spinal cord trauma, the main findings of which are discussed in the light of clinical expectations.
