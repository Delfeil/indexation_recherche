In the treatment of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, bone-patellar-tendon-bone allograft has been developed to a standard. Fixation of the graft with interference screws in the femur and/or with staple in the tibia are usual. ALL-PRESS-FIT fixation makes an implant-free acl-reconstruction possible. The bone-patellar-tendon-bone allograft is harvested with oversized bone blocks. The "Bone-Compactor" is used for modelling the oversized boneblocks for press-fit-fixation in femur und tibia. Implantation can be managed in either an arthroscopic or open procedure. The proximal boneblock is implanted with a sagittal alignment of the tendon. While rotating the distal block 90 ° to medial, a recontruction of anteromedial und posterolateral fascicle is possible. Tension can be controlled after step-by-step fixation proximal and distally with a distalisation of the tibial block at the end. The prominent tibial block will be pressed in on corticalis-niveau with the "Reconcillation-Hit". A femoral or tibial "Doubleblock-Fixation" allows a better anatomical reconstruction.
