The principles and potential benefits of physiotherapy following injuries close to the joints can be summarized as four treatment principles: (1) Treatment of the joints at each side of the fracture; (2) lowering of muscule tone; (3) mobilization of the connective tissue; and (4) improvement of the gliding processes in the joint affected. Ways of realizing each of these treatment principles are presented. The basic idea is to aim for early functional treatment. The physiotherapist needs knowledge of biomechanics, the ability to apply precisely tailored methods of treatment, and specific treatment guidelines. A good overall functional result as perceived by the patient is the ultimate goal.
