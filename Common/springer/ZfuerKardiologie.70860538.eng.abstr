  We report on a 61-year-old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease. The congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of (post-endocarditic) insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life. It was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization. The physiopathology of quadricuspid aortic valve will be discussed.
