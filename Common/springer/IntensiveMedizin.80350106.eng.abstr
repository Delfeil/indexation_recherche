 Immunosuppression-related Candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators, notably tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN). Important but unappreciated differences in the immunopathophysiology of fungal vs. bacterial infections make such cytokine priming appear contrary to current strategies for reducing cytokine-mediated organ injury and mortality due to gram-negative bacteremia and endotoxemia. Optimistically, preclinical studies to date have found that the coadministration of such immunoadjuvants does not compromise, and actually may improve, the efficacy of synthetic antifungals. Such combination therapies should continue to be evaluated in animal models of Candida infection which otherwise progress to lethal shock or chronic disseminated disease despite aggressive use of existing antifungal agents.
