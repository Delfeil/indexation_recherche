 An echinococcal cyst of the heart is a rare cause of acute cardiac tamponade. We report on a 24 year old male from the Kosovo who was brought in an emergency state from a provincial hospital complaining of severe dyspnea, thoracic pain, dizziness, and a short period of unconsciousness. Surgical decompression had to be performed urgently, because the pericardium could not be punctuated due to the position of the hydatid cyst.
