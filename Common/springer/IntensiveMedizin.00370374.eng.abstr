 Massive intrapulmonary bleeding is an alarming symptom that causes the patient to see his doctor immediately. In this situation diagnostic possibilities are limited due to the lack of time. The immediate treatment of the patient is necessary due to the life threathening airway obstruction. Initial treatment is according to the principles of emergency medicine. In order to treat the hemorrhage effectively, it is essential to differentiate between localized and generalized causes. Bronchoscopy is able to differentiate these possibilities; furthermore it enables one to localize the site of the bleeding. Generalized pulmonary hemorrhage is mostly due to systemic diseases, which are treated according to the pathogenesis.   Bronchial artery embolization has proven to be effective in the therapy of localized pulmonary hemorrhage. Ultimately the surgical resection of bleeding parts of the lung may be indicated.
