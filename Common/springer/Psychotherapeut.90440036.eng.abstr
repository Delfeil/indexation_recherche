The influence of defensivity, measured by validity scales of personality inventories (MMPI-K, FPI-R, GIESSEN-Test) on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in 309 patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy. In general, psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity. 25% of patients, who denied psychopathology at admission, did so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up, demonstrating an "especially good outcome" (means). Relative improvement (effect sizes), however, was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales. - Results are discussed with regard to prior hypotheses about the influence of defensivity.
