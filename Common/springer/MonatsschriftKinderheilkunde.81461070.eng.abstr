Collodion baby is a clinical description for a transient condition of the newborn which is caused by various disorders of cornification. The majority of cases are due to autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis. In up to 10% of cases "self-healing" of the skin occurs. We report about a mature male baby who at birth was covered entirely with a shining, collodion-like membrane. There also were marked ectropion of the eyelids and eversion of the lips. After shedding of the membrane almost complete clearing of the skin occurred until the age of three months. In the case reported here skin biopsies taken on the 20th day of life showed discrete and non-specific ultrastructural changes, with no features of lamellar ichthyosis or other cornification disorders.
