 A 54 year old women was admitted to a hospital because of acute thoracal pain, dyspnea, and clinical signs of overt right heart failure. Transthoracic and multiplane echocardiography established the diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm of the right coronary sinus of valsalva into the right atrium which could be confirmed by cardiac catheterization. During heart surgery, which was done without complications, the defect was closed with a suture. Six months later echocardiography showed a normal right ventricle; the function of the aortic valve was regular. Acute heart failure may be due to a congenital structural cardiac anomaly in spite of the age of 54. In such conditions transthoracic and especially transesophageal echocardiography serve as noninvasive excellent tools to make an exact diagnosis.
