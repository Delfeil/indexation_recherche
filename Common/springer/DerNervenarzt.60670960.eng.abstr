The goal of the study was a cross-cultural comparison of the parent ratings of behavior problems of children and adolescents aged 4-18 years in Germany, The Netherlands and the United States using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The analyses were undertaken in a German community sample (n = 1622) and a Dutch community sample (n = 2076). The results were compared with the data published by Achenbach for the national US sample. The analyses were based on the scales of the 1991 CBCL version and were performed for four age and sex groups (4- to 11-year-old boys/girls and 12- to 18-year-old boys/girls). In general, relatively minor differences could be detected between the three random samples. The range in the different samples was between -0.04 and 0.35, which is in line with other cross-cultural analyses using the CBCL. As long as no representative norms for Germany are available, the American norms can serve as an orientation for German studies using the CBCL.
