DNA-cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the WHO-classification. In this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three recurrencies were investigated. In all cases the histological type and WHO-grade and the Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index were determined. DNA cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on Feulgen-stained preparations, and the following parameters were calculated: stemline ploidy, 5c-exceeding rate, and 2c-deviation index.
