We report on the ventilation in prone position in a 5-year-old traumatized child with severe thoracic and abdominal injuries (lung contusion, rib fractures, rupture of liver and spleen). Under continuous analgosedation, the young patient was ventilated in prone position for 6 h, since acute lung injury and atelectasis persisted despite various therapeutic measures (artifical ventilation in the pressure controlled mode, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, reexpansion maneuver). After initiation of the prone position, we observed a rapid increase i narterial oxygenation, which persisted in the following period. The hemodynamic situation remained stable.
