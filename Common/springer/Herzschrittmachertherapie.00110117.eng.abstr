 Intraartial conduction disturbances (IACD) are the known substrate of re-entrant atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy. Signs of IACD can be missed on the standard ECG, and signal averaged (SA) P wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological (EPS) properties of atrial myocardium. Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing are known to electrophysiologists, but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice, and RAA based pacing modes remain standard even for pts. with IACD. We examined and compared EPS effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools: IEGM obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system (via telemetry) and time domain analysis of SA P wave in 22 pts. with BiA pacing system (implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and IACD). The results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently: RAA pacing aggravates IACD in comparison to sinus rhythm; the effects of CS pacing is less visible. BiA pacing normalises all atrial activation times. The normalisation of SA P wave duration, reduction of SA P wave dispersion, increasing of RMS 20 and decreasing of LAS 5 and finally abolition of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts. indicates beneficial effects of BiA pacing (in pts. with IACD) in comparison to sinus rhythm and RAA pacing. Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing in patients with IACD indicates suitability the need for alternative (resynchronising) atrial pacing modes. Time domain analysis of SA P wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non-invasive evaluation of EPS effects of different modes of atrial pacing.
