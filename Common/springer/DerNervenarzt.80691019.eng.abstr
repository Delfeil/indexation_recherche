The following review summarizes current knowledge on the treatment of therapy-resistant patients with affective disorders with supraphysiological doses of thyroxine (T4). Several groups have reported independently of each other that administration of 200-500 µg T4/day has excellent effects in 50-65% of patients a) with bipolar disorder, with or without "rapid cycling" course, who were previously resistant to all prophylactic drugs and b) in the treatment of therapy-resistant depression. T4 is effective only in combination with an antidepressant or a prophylactic drug. Side effects are minimal, even when T4 is administered over several years. These results now justify to recommend high dose T4-augmentation as "last-resort" treatment also beyond research purposes, i. e. in psychiatric wards and in private practice. Recommendations for clinical applications are given and hypotheses on possible mechanisms underlying the efficacy of T4 treatment are discussed.
