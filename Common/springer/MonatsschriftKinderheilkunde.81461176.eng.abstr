We report on a 71/2 year old child with familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia, insuccessfully treated by low cholesterol diet and cholesterol lowering drugs over a period of 41/2 years. As a complication of the third LDL apherese procedure, anemia had developed, followed by a myocardial infarction. Coronary arteriogram showed significant coronary artery disease with main stem stenosis and markedly impaired leftventricular contractility. Hypotension and bradycardia at the end of the invasive study prompted urgent aortocoronary bypass operation. Despite successful insertion of a venous graft, the patient die postoperatively in a low cardiac output.
