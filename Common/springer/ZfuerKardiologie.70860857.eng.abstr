 Coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries, however. With intravascular ultrasound, on the other hand, pathological changes in the vascular wall can be recorded. Despite typical symptoms, an angiographical image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries. In such cases, intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings. Two cases are used to illustrate this. In those, angiographic visualization of the coronary arteries was unable to produce an unambiguous finding despite typical clinical symptoms, yet intravascular ultrasound could detect considerable arteriosclerotic wall changes.
