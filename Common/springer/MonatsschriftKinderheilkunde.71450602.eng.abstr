Two infants presented with isolated paroxysmal dysfunction of eye movements. Both children had developed normally until they suffered from episodic conjugated upward deviation of gaze. The duration and the frequency of these episodes increased and were exacerbated by tiredness and often ameliorated by sleep. Horizontal eye movements were not disturbed. A constant nystagmus was not present, although one infant showed conjugated downbeat saccades in attempted downgaze. The infants continued to develop normally. Metabolic studies, EEG and MRI scan did not demonstrate any abnormality. The symptoms decreased over some months and subsided after three years. The clinical course of the patients is closely similar to the "Benign Paroxysmal Tonic Upward Gaze of Childhood".  Discussion: This entity of unknown aetiology has hardly ever been reported in the German literature and should be categorised in the group of dyskinesias of childhood. It is important to establish an accurate diagnosis in order to avoid unnecessary extensive investigations and to alleviate the parents' fear about their child's subsequent development.
