Diseases of the hindfoot are associated with considerable functional impairment and therefore may hamper patients' movements during gait considerably. Because of biomechanical overload, articular structures, tendons and ligaments are prone to early degenerative changes during the course of rheumatic diseases as visible with plain film radiography, sonography (US), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Findings may occur as arthritis of major joints or in the form of fibroostitis and bursitis of the os calcis. Despite the progressive course of rheumatic diseases and characteristic imaging findings, high variability of X-ray signs may occur. Plain film radiograms and high-resolution ultrasonography play a key role in imaging rheumatic diseases of the hindfoot. MRI supports imaging diagnosis in selected cases. The principal goals of diagnostic imaging are precise and reproducible documentation of morphologic abnormalities and differentiated analysis for planning proper conservative or surgical treatment.
