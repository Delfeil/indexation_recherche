Patients in traumatology need additional physiotherapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis. There is still a 4 % risk of deep vein thrombosis in outpatients receiving already low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis [9]. However, there are no prospective studies with a high number of patients to prove effectiveness of the presented physiotherapeutic tools, even if the hypothesis "achieving physiological-like conditions" sounds positive and some authors postulate that physiotherapy would be equal to drug prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis.
