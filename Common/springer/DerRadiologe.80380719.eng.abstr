Ionizing radiation from natural or man-made sources may affect human health. The main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer. To quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed. The ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation.
