  Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors play an important role in the propyhlaxis of coronary heart desease. A possible adverse effect is the induction of myopathies, which are described predominantly as interactions with other drugs. Two patients suffered myoglobinuria caused by rhabdomyolysis after cardiosurgical operations. In one case, a mechanical aortic valve prothesis was implanted for a combined valvular defect; in a second case, a coronary artery bypass grafting was performed for coronary heart disease. Both patients had taken HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors before the operation. Under forced diuresis, the elevated serum concentrations of creatin kinase and myoglobin decreased continuously.
