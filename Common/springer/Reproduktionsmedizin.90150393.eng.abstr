Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced physiologically in mitochondria during aerobic respiration while oxygen is reduced to water. In the ejaculate ROS are mainly generated by leukocytes, but can also be produced by the spermatozoa themselves. ROS are physiological signaling molecules and are involved in the regulation of spermatozoan functions such as capacitation and acrosome reaction. However, very high ROS levels, occurring for example during the "oxidative burst" of leukocytes, can impair these functions. Additionally high ROS concentrations can oxidize the lipids of the spermatozoa plasma membranes, which are prone to oxidation due to their high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, thus impairing spermatozoan functions. Increased generation of ROS in the ejaculate could be associated with an increased DNA-oxidation rate, motility loss, decreased capacity for spermatozoa-oocyte fusion and infertility. The main source of ROS in the ejaculate is leukocytes. Several antioxidants protect against these damaging effects. They are located both within the cells and in the seminal plasma. Without seminal plasma spermatozoa are exposed to the ROS generated by leukocytes without adequate protection. This situation occurs in the context of inflammation of the testes or the epididymidis as well as during spermatozoa preparation in assisted reproduction programs. To prevent the damage of spermatozoa preparation procedures should be used where leukocytes are separated from spermatozoa while seminal plasma is still present, such as swim-up from semen, gradient centrifugation or glass-wool filtration. Some controlled studies have shown beneficial effects of systemic antioxidative therapy of male infertility. It remains open, however, as to which diagnostic test is best suited to detect patients with ROS-associated infertility and the optimal medicament and its dosage.
