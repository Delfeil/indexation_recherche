Left ventricular afterload is most accurately represented by left ventricular end-systolic wall stress, but in clinical practice is commonly estimated by the systemic vascular resistance (SVR). End-systolic wall stress can be derived from M-mode and two-dimensional (2D) echocardiograms in combination with systolic arterial pressure (SAP). We tested transoesophageal echocardiography for the assessment of acute left ventricular afterload alterations in ventilated patients requiring cardiovascular support with noradrenaline or nitroglycerine.
