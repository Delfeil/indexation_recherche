A 14 year old macedonic girl was admitted with recurrent colicky abdominal pain that had lasted for several weeks. Laboratory check, plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show abnormalitities immediately. Increasing enzyme parameters though indicated cholestasis. Endoscopic retrograde choledocho-pancreaticography (ERCP) was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus. It revealed a common-channel situation (ductus choledochus and pancreaticus) and choledocholithiasis. Papillotomy and stone-extraction could not remove abdominal pain. Laparatomy and choledocho-jejunostomy could finally remove the symptoms.
