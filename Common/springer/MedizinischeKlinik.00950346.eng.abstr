Case Report: A 59-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital for general malaise with muscle and bone pain. Some weeks ago he had been treated with roxithromycin because of pneumonia. Physical examination revealed melena. Hemoglobin was 7.6 g/dl. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract did not show a bleeding source. Colonoscopy and histologic examination revealed hemorrhage caused by ischemic colitis. To rule out cardiac embolies in the presence of paroxysmal tachyarrhythmia absoluta a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed. A mediastinal mass infiltrating the upper left pulmonary vein was detected. The mass had not been visible on routine chest X-ray. Histologic examination of a bronchoscopically taken specimen revealed an oat-cell bronchial carcinoma.
