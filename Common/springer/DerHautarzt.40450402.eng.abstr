Abstract.  Mycetomas are subacute or chronic infections usually localized on unprotected skin areas and caused by fungi or Actinomyces. We report the case of a patient who suffered a splinter injury on his wrist after a motor accident. Six months later a cutaneous abscess with Actinobacillus acinomycetemcomitans developed on his wrist. Complete healing was obtained within 1 month after administration of ceftriaxon and doxycycline. The therapeutic management will be discussed.
