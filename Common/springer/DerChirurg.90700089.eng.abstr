 Mesenteric cysts are a rare cause of disease. In our hospital we treated one patient who suffered from bilateral ureteral obstruction followed by hydronephrosis, caused by a large mesenteric cyst. Because of its extent complete enucleation - the surgical procedure of choice - was not possible. We opened the cyst and made an external percutaneous drainage. After this treatment the patient recovered and even after 6 months there was no recurrence.
