Introduction: In recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement: hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation. While the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell counting, the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately. In the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation.
