Myositis proliferans is a reactive, intramuscular soft tissue disease characterized by fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation, showing similarities to the phase-like development seen in the general pathology of wound healing and hypertrophic scars. Immunohistochemically, a combined expression of vimentin and alpha-sm actin is seen in the spindle-shaped cell formations. The decisive histological preparation is supported by immunohistochemical techniques, especially in the differentiation from sarcoma. If a definite diagnosis is made, incomplete excision may suffice.
