  Background and objective: The medical management of heart failure improved greatly during the last decade. Heart transplantation (HTx) as surgical alternative is an established measure but operation numbers stagnated due to the lack of donor organs and still the 1 year mortality is about 20%. Rising numbers of new registrations led to long waiting lists with a high mortality rate. Solutions are intensified therapeutic concepts and improvements in organ allocation. This study was done to show if a combined intensified medical management and a regional donor allocation system may improve outcome in heart transplant candidates.
