Developmental anomalies of the pancreas result from fusion failure between the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts (pancreas divisum) or from rotational failure of the ventral bud (pancreas anulare). These variations and anomalies of the ductal anatomy can be asymptomatic throughout life or can cause varying symptoms in different age periods. Pancreas divisum and pancreas anulare can be confirmed exclusively by means of pancreatography. Congenital disorders of the pancreas derive from genetic defects involving different organ systems, which usually dominanate the clinical symptoms. Developmental anomalies and congenital disorders of the pancreas lead to varying morphological alterations of the organ which can be assessed by means of modern imaging.
