 The majority of lesions of the spinal accessory nerve occur as an iatrogenic injury after lymph node biopsy in the posterior cervical triangle (trigonum colli laterale). In most cases the accessory nerve palsy is not recognised immediately after the injury. Therefore surgical repair is often performed too late to regain sufficient function of the paralytic trapezius muscle. Later than 6 months after the injury, reconstruction seems to be hopeless. However, "timely" reconstructions often have poor results. Exact knowledge of anatomy, postoperative check of the trapezius muscle and, if an accessory nerve injury has occurred, early reconstructive procedures (neurolysis, reconstruction of nerve continuity) may on the one hand prevent iatrogenic lesions of the nerve and on the other hand improve the reconstructive result. A series of 6 patients with an injury of the spinal accessory nerve after lymph node biopsy is reported. In 2 cases primary coaptation, in 3 cases interpositional nerve grafting and in 1 case neurotisation was performed. Clinical recovery was achieved in 3 of the 6 cases.
