Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease. Even the use of potent immunosuppressive drugs often barely controls the disease. In addition, treatment-related side effects are common due to the high doses of immunosuppressive drugs necessary. We report on two cases of acutely exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus which were difficult to control with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Both patients were additionally treated with IgM-enriched preparations of intravenous immunoglobulins. In both cases, the doses of the immunosuppressive drugs used could be significantly reduced. After nine treatment cycles, patients remained disease-free for a follow-up period of one year with only minimal immunosuppressive therapy. Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulins can be used for therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus.
