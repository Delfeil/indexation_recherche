Abstract.  Of a total of 131 patients suffering from chronic urticaria, 15 were cautiously reexposed to ASA after an initial provocative exposure during an urticaria test programme 2 - 11 years before. Only 1 of these patients, who had undergone the initial provocative test 7 years earlier, reacted at the same intensity; 1 other patient reacted with much less intense symptoms 4 years after the original test. Among 3 other patients, who merely reacted to ASA intake with urticarial eruptions and did not suffer from chronic urticaria, only 1 presented 4 years after the initial exposure with oedema of the skin and itching. The tolerance threshold was markedly higher. These results suggest that the sensitivity to intolerance-inducing agents is reduced relatively quickly and may subside completely in most cases.
