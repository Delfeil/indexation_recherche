Giant-cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern, frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given, and may potentially metastasize. By virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta-articular localization, giant-cell bone tumors require specific surgical management. Thus, an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone cementing, possibly combined with instillation of phenol or cryotherapy. These combined treatment modalities assure a high-quality procedure, defined as the actual way medical care is delivered, by promoting the quality of the outcome, defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient's state of health.
