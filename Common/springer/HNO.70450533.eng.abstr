This report summarizes our experiences with the subjective visual vertical (SVV) as a clinical neuro-otological tool. In the SVV test, patients have to orient a dim light bar in an otherwise dark surrounding earth-vertical, using a remote-control. Normal subjects in an upright position did not deviate more than 2 ° from true vertical. After vestibular neurectomy, the SVV was consistently tilted by some 12 ° toward the affected ear. Smaller tilts (~7 °) of the SVV occured in patients with spontaneous peripheral vestibular diseases. This shift in SVV disappeared within weeks to months, similar to the spontaneous nystagmus. After stapes surgery slight deviations of the SVV towards the unoperated ear were seen in about 20% of the patients, indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs. Assessed in an upright position, the SVV thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic otolithic input differences between the two ears.
