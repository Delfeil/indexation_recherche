We reporting four cases of HIV infection caused by bone allografts from one donor. All transplantations were performed between November 1984 and January 1985. In all, 12 recipients had bone allografts from the HIV-infected donor, 7 of whom are now HIV-negative and 4, HIV-positive. One of the patients died a natural death in her 10th decade. The donor was not been tested before the grafts were harvested, as HIV-antibody detection was not possible at the time (October 1984); no HIV-antibody kits had yet been developed. Subsequent testing of the asservated serum for HIV antibodies gave a positive result. The chronological course of the case is described and the case is discussed in detail.
