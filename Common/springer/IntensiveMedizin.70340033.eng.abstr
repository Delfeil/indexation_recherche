 In the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit. These may be fatal in patients treated conservatively with anticoagulation only. In literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of 3 - 4%. Extremely mobile, long, worm-shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus-related mortality rate which ranges from 30 - 40%. Current therapeutic strategies favour fibrinolytic therapy with consecutive anticoagulation.
