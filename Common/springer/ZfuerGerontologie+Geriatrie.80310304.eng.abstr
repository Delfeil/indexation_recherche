  The article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised. The chances for a refinancing of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the realm of public law. With the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects. Simultaneously it gains normative significance. This is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions, and further in the context of the discussion concerning the revitalisation of local social policy for the elderly. Precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the municipalities may be excused from their responsibility to form, preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly. This article denies this.
