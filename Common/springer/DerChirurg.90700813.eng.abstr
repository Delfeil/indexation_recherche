 A 24-year-old healthy man developed Clostridium perfringens myonecrosis with severe sepsis after plating of a closed femoral fracture. The leg could be preserved by complete resection of the fascia from all muscle compartments of the leg, including the pelvitrochanteric and the iliopsoas muscles, radical removal of necrotic muscle tissue, dissection of the para-aortal infrarenal lymphatics, daily débridements over 2 weeks, and systemic antibiotic therapy. The plate was removed because of a second septic episode followed by temporary stabilization with external fixation. After soft-tissue healing, plate fixation was carried out. The patient developed significant deficit of knee flexion (0  °/0/20  °) due to heterotopic ossification of the quadriceps femoris muscle that could be improved by partial resection of heterotopic bone formation. In the same operation the bony defect of the femur was filled with autologous bone graft. The fracture healed 10 months after the accident. The patient can work full time in his previous profession as a mechanic, but again needs operative mobilization of the knee joint, including open arthrolysis and quadriceps plasty.
