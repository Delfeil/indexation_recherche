We report on two children (7-year-old girl; 11-year-old boy) with an unusual manifestation of neuroborreliosis involving the nervus opticus and nervus abducens. Both children had a bilateral oedema of the optic disk and a strabismus convergens caused by paralysis of the 6th cranial nerve. Since, in addition, the children presented with headache, initially an intracranial tumor was considered but then excluded by magnetic resonance imaging. The cerebrospinal fluid showed a mononuclear pleocytosis, and specific antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi were detected in serum and in CSF. These results confirmed the diagnosis of "neuroborreliosis". All clinical manifestations disappeared a few days to weeks after treatment with intravenous ceftriaxon. Discussion: In the presence of cranial nerve palsy and optic disk oedema of unknown origin neuroborreliosis may be the correct diagnosis. Isolated involvement of the eye in the late stage of Lyme borreliosis is distinct from neuroborreliosis with cranial nerve involvement.
