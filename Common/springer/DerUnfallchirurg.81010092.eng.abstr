In the care and further treatment of patients with hand injuries, a necessary requirement of the hand surgeon is that he be able to cope with the interlocking factors that are no longer influential, for example, the type and extent of the trauma or the age of the patient; the influential factors are a thought-out care plan, atraumatic action with regard to optimal restoration of the hand. This also showed a retrospective analysis of results and post-examination from flexor tendon injuries in the hand of 298 patients, who were surgically cared for from 1984 to 1994 at the surgical clinic of the University of Jena. Of the 298 patients 119 patients with 198 flexor tendon injuries (165 fingers and 33 thumbs) were followed up. For objective assessment of the treatment results, the assessment scheme Buck-Gramcko was used.
