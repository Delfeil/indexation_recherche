Papuloerythroderma of Ofuji is a rare skin disorder described primarily in Japanese patients. It occurs primarily in elderly men. The initital lesions are diffuse red papules, sparing the face, palms and soles. Later the papules coalesce into an erythroderma, with typical sparing of the skin folds and creases (the deck chair sign). Pruritus is usually intense. Lymphadenopathy, peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels all are common. Both systemic corticosteroids and systemic PUVA therapy have been recommended. We describe a German male who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for papuloerythroderma of Ofuji and responded well to PUVA bath therapy with both improvement in skin findings and reduction in pruritus.
