There are many reasons for cervical lymph-node enlargement. In particular, the large group of infectious diseases must be considered along with malignant diseases. The coexistence of an uncommon infectious disease with malignant disease is a rare event. We report the case of an otherwise healthy 69-year-old man with marked enlargement of his cervical lymph nodes. A diagnosis of a recent toxoplasmosis infection was made based on positive IgG and IgM toxoplasma titers and the results of fine-needle aspiration from a lymph node. Since the enlarged lymph nodes persisted for more than weeks, the lymph node was excised. Histological examination revealed a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. IgM titers in toxoplasmosis can persist up to 1 year. In cases with rare infectious diseases like toxoplasmosis in immunocompromized patients, swollen lymph nodes that persist or grow should lead to the suspicion of additional disease. A diagnosis can be confirmed by removing a lymph node for histology.
