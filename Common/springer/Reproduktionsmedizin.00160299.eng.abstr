All of the major features and functions that are required for sperm to fertilise an egg (good motility, uniform morphology, ability to bind to the zona pellucida, capacity to undergo the acrosome reaction, capability of fusing with the vitellus, condensed chromatin, the ability to fertilise eggs in vivo and in vitro and the ability to support normal embryo development) are acquired within the human epididymal canal. Many secreted epididymal glycoproteins have been identified that bind to particular sperm membrane domains and appear to be involved in facilitating sperm-ovum interaction. The ability of "immature" sperm from the proximal epididymis or germ cells from the testis to initiate embryo development as a result of artificial reproductive technologies depends on these procedures' bypassing the major role of the epididymis, that of permitting survival and transport to and through the egg investments.
