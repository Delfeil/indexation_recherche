Background: Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) may follow complicated retinal detachment. The normally quiescent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) proliferates and dedifferentiates. These alterations of specialized cell characteristics are probably due to regulatory nuclear receptors. In this paper, human RPE cells were examined for expression of the nuclear glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Ligands for this receptor may influence the proliferation of RPE cells.
