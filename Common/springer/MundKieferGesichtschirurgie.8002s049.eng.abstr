Craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis. The aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth, correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth. The patient population consisted of 71 children; the postoperative follow-up time in 57 patients was more than 12 months. Of the children followed up, 36 were male and 21 female. Thirty-six cases involved untreated non-syndromic craniosynostosis; the remaining 21 were syndrome cases. The patient ages ranged from 16 to 27 months. In 11 cases correction of an occipital craniosynostosis was carried out. The fronto-occipital circumference was registered in accordance with Prader's percentile table. The operative method included a fronto-parietal craniotomy, the temporary removal and shaping of the fronto-orbital band and a vault cranioplasty. During follow-up 13 patients treated with fronto-orbital advancement in cases of isolated craniosynostosis remained in the registered percentile curve. In 13 patients a change to a lower percentile curve was confirmed; 1 patient changed to a higher curve. In cases of syndromic craniosynostosis 10 patients remained in the post-operatively registered percentile curve; 8 patients changed to a lower and 1 patient to a higher percentile curve. No growth restriction of the reshaped calvaria after surgical correction of craniosynostosis was observed. No significant difference was found in the potential calvaria growth between syndromic and isolated craniosynostosis.
