 Wavelet analysis represents a new branch of mathematics which has already had a large impact on signal analysis and data processing technology. This article explains both the continuous wavelet transform and the discrete wavelet transform and presents a number of biomedical applications pertaining to cardiology and electrophysiology. In particular, wavelet analysis is shown to efficiently remove noise from electrocardiograms (ECGs) as well as compressing ECG data by at least a factor of 8:1. Additionally, wavelet analysis can identify key ECG features in the presence of noise and baseline drift. Future applications of wavelets include ECG characterization and a computationally efficient solution to the inverse-dipole problem.
