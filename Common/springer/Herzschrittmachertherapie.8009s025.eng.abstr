 Methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing. P-wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting.  However, correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p-wave analysis with the high resolution ECG. Signal averaging triggered to the p-wave is significantly superior to QRS-triggering. Bidirectional filtering or FIR-filtering is necessary.  The data indicate significant differences in p-wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation. Class I antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p-wave duration, but did not influence spectral parameters. Treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p-wave energy without altering p-wave duration.  After optimizing the methods, p-wave analysis offers promise to separate patients prone to atrial fibrillation and normals. In addition, the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible.
