For decades the results of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) are differently discussed, so that it is not definitely recommended at present the less so since the morbidity of this operation can't be neglected. Since the beginning of 1995 we practice a gamma-probe guided sentinel lymphonodectomy (SLNE) on patients with melanoma from a Breslow tumor thickness of 1 mm upward, after injecting a colloidal 99m-Tc labelled tin (II) - sulfid solution around the tumor or the scar, if the tumor has been excided before. By this method, that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage I or II (UICC) but even histopathologically to a stage III and who are profiting of a removal of the regional lymph nodes, the sentinel node can be exactly localised, tissue-sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity. When finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows.
