 We report on a 20-month-old girl who was known to suffer from mucolipidosis II (I-Cell-Disease, Leroy Syndrome) since birth. The clinical features, biochemical analysis and histopathological findings are briefly discussed. The girl died suddenly while she was being fed by her mother. Death was caused by acute respiratory insufficiency associated with the underlying disease. From the histomorphology of the lungs there was no evidence to hold the mother responsible for the child's death.
