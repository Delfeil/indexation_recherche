 The relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies. Only case reports of one or more patients exist. Optimal therapy, therefore, remains controversial, and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given. Nevertheless, in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred, if no contraindications exist. Two cases are presented together with a literature review.
