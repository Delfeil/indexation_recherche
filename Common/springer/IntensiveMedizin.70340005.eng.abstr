 The term "ecstasy" comprises many different hallucinogenic amphetamines, of which the most prominent representatives are MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) and MDEA (3,4-methylenedioxyethamphetamine). Apart from these and related active substances there are additional substances to be found in the offered preparations (e. g., amphetamine, ephedrine, selegiline, paracetamol), which can modify the effect and the symptoms of ecstasy to a great extent. In Germany, the use of ecstasy and thus the frequency of complications after the ingestion of ecstasy has increased immensely in recent years. Consequently, there is a growing need for knowledge and strategies to deal with medical complications caused by ecstasy.
