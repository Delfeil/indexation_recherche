Tyrosinase mRNA produced by melanoma cells can be detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) with fine-needle tissue punctures. Fine-needle punctures from six suspected skin and lymph node metastases in three patients with malignant melanoma were analysed via rt-pcr for tyrosinase mRNA. All the suspected metastases were surgically removed and histologically examined separately. In each case the rt-pcr results and the histological diagnosis corresponded. This less invasive and highly sensitive method could prove to be a useful alternative in the diagnosis of melanoma metastasis.
