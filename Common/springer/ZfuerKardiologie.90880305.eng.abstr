  The extent of physical activity and the dynamic performance capacity show an inverse relationship to cardiovascular mortality, independent of the influence of other risk factors, but the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. Most concepts assume that the aerobic capacity of the peripheral musculature is increased by training, and thus improved cardiocirculatory regulation and especially a more favorable stress reaction pattern are attained. This adaptation is essentially an inverse adaptation mechanism as in established cardiocirculatory insufficiency.
