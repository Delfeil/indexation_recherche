Mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential. It is widely distributed in soil and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of infections by M. gordonae in immunocompromised patients. In contrast, only four cases of skin infections by M. gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published. We report on another patient without evidence of immunodeficiency who developed an atypical mycobacteriosis after a thorn injury during gardening. M. gordonae was isolated by tissue culture. The skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with doxycycline for three months.
