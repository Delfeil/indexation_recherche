Children with limb deficiencies or amputations of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand or to walk according to their state of development, because just standing and walking are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration. Supply them with a prosthesis, orthesis and orthoprosthesis is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation. While a prosthesis replaces parts of the extremities, orthesis stabilizes the existing extremity. Orthoprostheses compensate longitudinal malformations, have a supporting effect, allow growth to be controlled and compensate for shortening. Just as important as the remedy is early medical treatment. The sooner the treatment starts, the better the results.
