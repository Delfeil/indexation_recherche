Contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography permits comprehensive assessment of the arterial system in the chest, abdomen und lower extremities. The method combines intravenous bolus application of a non-nephrotoxic, paramagnetic, extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3D data set. High contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues, inherent three-dimensionality and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality. Contrast-enhanced 3D MRA is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies. This review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest, abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several clincial examples.
