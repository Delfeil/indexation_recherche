The clinico-pathologic characteristics and the histological/immunohistological differential diagnosis of villous trophoblastic lesions (complete, partial, and invasive hydatiform moles), gestational choriocarcinoma and trophoblastic tumors and pseudotumors of the placental site (placental-site trophoblastic tumor, exaggerated placental site reaction, placental site nodule) are reviewed in context with aspects of cytogenetics, epidemiology and molecular pathogenesis.
