The principle of, "selective shunting" during carotid endarterectomy requires a special concept to monitor neuronal function. The valence of the oxymetric methods, "near-infrared" spectroscopy (NIRS) and conjunctival oxygen tension (pcjO2) was determined with the reference method somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP).
