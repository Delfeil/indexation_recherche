Background. Pulmonary interstitial emphysema is a serious complication of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome carrying an increased risk of intraventricular haemorrhage and development of chronic lung disease of prematurity. Management of unilateral PIE usually includes aggressive methods such as surgical removal of the affected lung tissue or selective intubation of the contralateral bronchus.
