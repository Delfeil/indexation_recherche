Abstract.  Benign, non-parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or CT scan. We present the case of a 68-year-old patient who showed obstructive jaundice due to a hemorrhagic liver cyst compressing the choledochal duct. Due to the location of the cyst in the porta hepatis with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma, operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm.
