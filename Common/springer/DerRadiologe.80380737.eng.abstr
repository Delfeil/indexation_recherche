Magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines. However, the patient is exposed to static as well as to time-dependent magnetic fields and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields. In 1997 the Strahlenschutzkommission, the German Radiological Protection Commission, passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics. In this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given. In the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed, as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields, the gradient fields and the radio-frequency fields. Additionally, advice is given for the protection of high-risk patients, personnel, and the general public, together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers.
