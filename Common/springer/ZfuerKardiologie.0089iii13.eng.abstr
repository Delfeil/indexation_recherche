 There is increasing evidence for a fatal interaction of myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in some patients with coronary disease. Evidence comes from autopsy studies, from the evaluation of patients who survived an episode of sudden cardiac death, from follow-up data of these patients either treated or not by revascularization therapy and/or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and indicate that reducing the individual ischemic burden will be beneficial to reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Studies in patients with stable and especially with unstable angina using Holter monitoring could demonstrate that there is a close and causal relationship between myocardial ischemia inducing or aggravating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death particularly in patients with unstable and postinfarction status. This review summarizes some of our clinical knowledge on this topic and indicates the preventive strategies for myocardial ischemia are the antiarrhythmic treatment of choice in patients with severe coronary artery disease and patients with evidence or at risk for ischemic proarrhythmia.
