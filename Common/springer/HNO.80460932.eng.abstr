Following the recommendations of the United States National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference in 1993, otoacoustic emissions (OAE) are now used internationally for hearing screening. The use of recording systems as well as the interpretation of results requires specially trained personnel although measurements are easier to perform than other recording methods available. To date, no objective method for general hearing screening, has been introduced in Germany, for neonates or children at risk, even though it would be desirable to detect and rehabilitate children with congenital hearing loss as early as possible (incidence, 1-6 per 1000). The Echosensor provides the means for carrying out OAE recordings within a short period of time and includes an automatic evaluation of results. Recordings can also be made by trained personnel. As a comparison test, audiologically trained staff recorded otoacoustic emissions in 111 newborn children in order to compare the results of the Echosensor with the results of a conventional OAE measurement device (the ILO88). The aim of this pilot study was to determine the reliability and validity of the recordings in comparison with available standards in brainstem audiometry. Our study showed that the results of the Echosensor corresponded well with the ILO88 results. Consequently, an OAE measuring method is now available is also provides high sensitivity and specificity and is easy to use. Our findings show that the Echosensor can meet the demands of systematic hearing screening in Germany.
