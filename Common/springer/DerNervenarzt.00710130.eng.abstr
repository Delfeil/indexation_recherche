We report on the history and clinical findings of an injecting drug abuser in the Canton of Zurich who presented with multiple deep abscesses in the arms and legs. A diagnosis of wound botulism was made based on his clinical presentation with a rapidly progressing descending paralysis starting at the cranial nerves, a neuromuscular junction disorder on neurophysiologic testing, and normal findings on lumbar puncture. Several cases of wound botulism have occured in IV drug abuse in Switzerland since 1997. We suspect subcutaneous injections of contaminated heroin containing Clostridium spores as sites of entry. Wound botulism caused by Clostridium botulinum is a rare cause of rapidly progressing, generalized, flaccid paralysis and should be considered in patients with a history of IV drug abuse presenting with descending paralysis.
