Forty-nine patients (mean age, 54 years) admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry. The mean follow-up was 36 months (range, 19-54 months). The deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure. Using a clinical score, most of the patients had satisfactory results. The plantar pressure distribution showed significant load asymmetries of patients with satisfactory results and those with non-satisfactory results. Dynamic gait analysis allows quantification of gait asymmetry and clinically non-visible gait disorder.
