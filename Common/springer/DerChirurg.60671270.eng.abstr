 Pelvic floor hernias are rare. Three different types can be distinguished; these are, in order of decreasing frequency: obturator, perineal and sciatic hernias. We report a rare case of a perineal hernia with an intra- and extraperitoneal part. Furthermore a two-stage surgical approach (first transabdominal, then posterior) is presented.
