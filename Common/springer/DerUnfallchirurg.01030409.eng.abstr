Abstract   This case presents the history of a 56-year-old patient suffering from low back pain for a period of several weaks. The radiological und histopathological examination showed hints for a spondylodiscitis of the fifth lumbar vertebra. Due to a progressive destruction of the fifth vertebra a ventral stabilisation was performed. Again the histological examination showed the characteristics of an unspezific spondylodiscitis. The last biopsy, taken during the explantation of the fixateur interne showed a high malignant lymphoma. A course of chemotherapy was started following the CHOP-Protocol acompanied by radiotherapy. This case demonstrates that meticulous clinical examination as well as advanced radiological techniques can fail in rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis.
