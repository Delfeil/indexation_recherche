Hypnosis, autogenic training, progressive relaxation and biofeedback show good empirical evidence concerning relaxation-therapy and are useful techniques in psycho- or behavior-therapy. Though they share some aspects with body-oriented psychotherapy these relaxation-techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious meditation. Though in details somewhat different, the methodology of these techniques creates a framework, in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited. However, regular practice of the patients is requiered. Focussed attention, imagination and new attributions of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects, which may contribute to enhanced internal selfcontrol and selfesteem. Controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders (e.g. headache, pain, ess. hypertension), as well as anxiety and sleeping disorders. As components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs, there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders (e.g. concerning addiction). Relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific-based component in the treatment of psychic, psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders, except psychosis.
