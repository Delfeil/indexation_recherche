The development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto-orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature. In a retrospective study on 33 patients (15 girls and 18 boys) the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically. Only patients with a minimum age of 6 years and with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included. The radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of pneumatisation at or above the level of the supraorbital rims, as projected in postero-anterior cephalograms. According to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72.7% of our patients. There was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient, age at surgery or the amount of advancement. With the exception of severe cases of Crouzon's disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto-orbital correction.
