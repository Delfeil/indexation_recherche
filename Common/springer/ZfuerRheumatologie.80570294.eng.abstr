 Clinical trials with monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF (anti-TNF mAbs) and soluble TNF receptor fusion proteins (sTNFR-IgGs) have demonstrated that systemic and synovial trapping of TNF results in long lasting anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical indices of inflammatory synovitis and laboratory parameters (CRP and ESR) respond to single and repeated administrations of anit-TNF therapies in a dose-dependent fashion. Studies on the immuno-pharmacological profile in patients suggest evidence that TNF trapping down-regulates the effector mechanisms involved in the immuno-inflammatory response in rheumatoid arthritis. Inhibition of PLA2- and COX-2-derived pathways of mediators of inflammation (prostanoids and leukotrienes) decreases signs and symptoms of inflammatory synovitis such as joint swelling, tenderness and pain. Down-regulating of the cytokine-inducible adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 in endothelial cells and synoviocytes results in a marked inhibition of trans-endothelial migration of inflammatory and immune cells. A decrease of cytokine-regulated metalloproteinase expression results in normalization of circulating MMP-1 and MMP-3 levels. The effect of TNF neutralization on mechanisms of rheumatoid joint destruction has the long-term potential for preventing or decreasing the rate of erosive changes of cartilage and bone.
