 The introduction of "early defibrillation" by emergency technicians (nonphysicians) in Germany led to a very emotional and controversial discussion, since the use of a defibrillator had previously been restricted to physicians. "Early defibrillation" by definition signifies immediate defibrillation by first-arriving nonphysician rescuers. The alternative term is EMT (emergency medical technician) defibrillation. The term early defibrillation is suggestive of very early defibrillation. Even if this is seldom achieved in real life, it points to the fact that this means the earliest possible defibrillation. "Early defibrillation" is closely related to the chain of survival concept. The clearly structured optimized chain of survival, a tiered emergency medical system, is a precondition for an effective early defibrillation program. In the tiered system of densely stationed, basically qualified rescue personnel, basic life support including defibrillation with semi-automatic defibrillators is started until the emergency physician (in other countries paramedics) arrives at the scene. Only a few hours of training are necessary to enable safe and effective use of semi-automatic defibrillators by basic rescue personnel. The use of semi-automatic defibrillators in early defibrillation programs is recommended by the American Heart Association and by the European Resuscitation Council. Even the use of these devices by minimally trained non-rescue personnel (e.g., policemen and other security personnel) is a second-step recommendation.
