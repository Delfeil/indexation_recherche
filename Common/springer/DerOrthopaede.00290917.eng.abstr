Since their first description several years ago, superior glenoid labral lesions have increasingly been blamed for shoulder problems associated with sports. Originally merely describing arthroscopically visible upper labral/biceps abnormalities, the current understanding is that often clinical problems such as impingement pain or even rotator cuff disease can be secondary to these lesions, especially in overhead athletes. Impingement in these cases is caused by superior shoulder instability originating from an unstable biceps insertion that is present for example in SLAP (superior labrum from anterior to posterior) lesions. Additional problems such as internal or posterosuperior impingement that are often found simultaneously in these patients are pathomorphologically located in the same anatomical region and therefore make exact diagnosis and thus treatment more complex. Magnetic resonance imaging with intra-articular contrast enhancement and particularly arthroscopy are the primary tools for exact diagnosis and classification of superior labral/biceps pathology.
