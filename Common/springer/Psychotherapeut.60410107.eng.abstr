Ernst Simmel belonged to the small circle of early psychoanalysts who were stiving with fascination and "productive orthodoxy" for the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine. He is the founder of the first psychoanalytic polyclinic in Berlin 1919 and of the first psychoanalytic clinic ("Sanatorium Schloss Tegel") 1927 in Germany. Nearly at the same time he formulated the educational profile of a medical specialist in psychotherapeutic medicine. Rediscovering him as a pioneer may also be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National- socialism which led to various historical splittings of the professional societies in this field. For all generations he is an authentic figure for identification, especially for the new specialty of psychotherapeutic medicine in Germany. However, the emphasis on Ernst Simmel should not lead to nearly 60 other pioneers who had to leave germany compulsorily because of their jewish origin, being neglected.
