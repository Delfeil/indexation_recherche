Abstract.  Temporary hair loss is well accepted as a possible result of psoriatic plaques. On the other hand, it is still a controversial issue whether psoriasis can cause scarring alopecia. The following report presents a 38-year-old woman who had been suffering from progressive hair loss from chronic psoriatic plaques of the scalp for some years. Clinical examination revealed an area of scarring alopecia in association with typical features of psoriasis. Histology showed a cordlike fibrosis replacing former hair follicles, a perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis occasionally invading the follicular epithelium, and characteristic features of psoriasis of the scalp. The clinical course and the lack of evidence for any other causes of scarring alopecia suggest an aetiopathogenetic link between psoriasis and scarring alopecia. Knowledge of this relationship appears to be of practical significance, since efficient antipsoriatic therapy can stop hair loss and thus may be able to prevent scarring.
