The increased consumption of "ecstasy" (MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) has also increased the number of life-threatening intoxications. From a Medline search of the years 1992-1996, reports were registered and evaluated. Besides cerebral, cardiorespiratory, renal, and hepatic symptoms, hyperthermia syndromes such as malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or the serotonin syndrome were common. In addition to a discussion of the intoxication symptoms and their acute and intensive-care therapy, the psychological and physiological effects of "ecstasy" will be described. Some historical considerations of the topic are included in this review.
