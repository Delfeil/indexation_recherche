Friedreich's disease is a very rare neurological disorder that causes degeneration of the posterior roots of the spinal nerves and progresses to the anterior roots, even in young adults. Hospital emergency teams face the question of choice of anaesthesia in such patients should general anaesthesia be preferred to regional anaesthesia. We report a 36-year-old patient with spino-cerebellar heredoataxia (Friedreich's disease) who underwent a proctological procedure after administration of spinal anaesthesia with 3 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine in a sitting position. Both the intra- and post-operative courses were unremarkable; in particular, with regard to the underlying neurological disease, no complications were observed.
