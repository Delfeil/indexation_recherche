 Based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in RA patients, new therapeutic principles have been developed, aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines. Both principles, however, have proven to be very effective. In addition, the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable, followed by a first, very carefully formulated protocol for human RA. Gene therapy for RA has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage, not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to RA patients. Several problems, such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved. With more experiments this therapeutic principle might become available and might prove effective even in a disease with a systemic character like RA in the coming years.
