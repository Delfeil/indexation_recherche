Abstract.  We report on a 23-year-old man with hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia of the Clouston type showing a severe expression of his gene defect. As a prominent feature of this case, we describe the presence of verruciform keratoderma of hands and feet, and we visualize these skin changes by means of a new imprinting technique.
