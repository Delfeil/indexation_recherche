Callus distraction of the midface is a recently developed surgical method for treatment of atrophic or hypoplastic maxillae. The treatment planning is based on individual shaped models, being constructed with the help of computed tomographic data. Our experience is based on 10 patients (3 male/7 female; age: 11-55 years). The demands for imaging are reported. The following imaging procedure is recommended: 1. preoperative: lateral x-ray, orthopantomogram, spiral CT, 2. during the time of callus distraction with normaly takes 4 to 5 weeks: lateral x-ray (every 10 days), and 3. for follow up: lateral x-ray and spiral CT. The Radiation exposure caused by the repetitive images is calculated in detail.
