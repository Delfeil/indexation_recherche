Voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and/or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections. The urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders, but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction. In the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed. Behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role. Therapy is based on behavioural modification.
