In this retrospective study, the meniscal status of 45 patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears is reported. The ACL injury was initially documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy. Treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and bracing. The mean follow-up was 8 years. Twenty-nine (65%) patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of 3 years after the ACL injury during the follow-up period. Rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears. The most common tear of the medial meniscus was the bucket-handle type, followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn. Secondary reconstruction of the ACL was necessary in 24 patients complaining of the meniscus giving way. The remaining five patients had rearthroscopy 4 years after the ACL injury and a partial meniscectomy and ACL reconstruction was performed. Sixteen patients (35% of the overall sample) had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow-up period, but discontinued their sporting activities. Results indicate the increasing incidence of meniscal tears during ACL insufficiency. We recommend that patients with ruptures of the ACL should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and mensical repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously.
