  The effects of "Care-insurance" on the situation of those in need of home care, is the object of first implementation-studies of SGB XI. They largely agree on the high level of satisfaction found among those who draw the benefits of the insurance scheme, particularly among those who claim a cash premium; further they largely agree on the low level of influence of the "Care-insurance" on changes in the form of nursing. An account of the results of the milieu-oriented "Freiburger Pflegestudie", which investigates the effects of "Care-insurance" differentiated according to the various types of care-situations, forms the centre of the article.
