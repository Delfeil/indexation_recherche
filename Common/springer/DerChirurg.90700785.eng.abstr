 The laparoscopic creation of ileostomas and colostomas can be performed in a quick, safe and technically effective manner. The advantages of the minimally invasive approach are low morbidity and mortality, minimal blood loss and fast recovery in these mostly multimorbid patients as well as shorter time of hospitalization. We report on a total of 20 patients who underwent laparoscopic creation of colostoma in 19 cases and creation of ileostoma in one case in a period of 2 years. There were no intraabdominal complications and no lethal outcome. All patients reached their preoperative level of mobilization at the 2nd postoperative day. The indications for the laparoscopic enterostomy are described.
