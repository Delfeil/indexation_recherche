 Hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance. When hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration, the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest. Usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia. They are often iatrogenic. Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, disorders of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, high-dose antibiotics, and immunsuppressive treatments may result in hyperkalemia. The most important pathogenetic mechanisms are (1) renal insufficiency, (2) hyporeninemic hypoaldeosteronism, (3) tubular disorders, and (4) cellular disorders.
