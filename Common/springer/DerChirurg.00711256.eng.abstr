Abstract.  From 1970 to 1998, 35 children with omphalocele (OC) and 31 with gastroschisis (GS) were treated at the Department of Paediatric Surgery at Lübeck Medical University. Forty of 43 survivors were examined in 1990, the data of 30 patients were renewed in 1999 and 12 new cases added. Total follow-up was 1-28 years. Primary closure was possible in 25 OCs and 20 GSs. Eighteen children with OC and 8 with GS suffered from additional abnormalities, which were treated simultaneously. Twenty percent of the babies with OC died mostly because of severe congenital anomalies and 12.9 % of GS because of infectious complications in combination with other diseases. There were no more deaths in the last decade. Accordingly, there was a reduction in consecutive operations. Improvements were due to better operative and perioperative treatment as well as abortions following improved ultrasound examinations. The results of the literature and our own experience show the benefit of primary closure. A two-stage approach with dura/amnion or a silo procedure prevents high intra-abdominal pressure, therefore, indirect measurements of intra-abdominal pressure can be used exceptionally. Umbilical preservation offers better cosmetic results. Long-term follow-up reveals normal growth and development of the children except for those with severe congenital anomalies. All the others are participating without problems in normal activities and education without reduction in their quality of life. Today an isolated OC or GS is not an indication for abortion. If prenatal OC or GS is diagnosed, paediatric surgeons should be involved in the consultations.
