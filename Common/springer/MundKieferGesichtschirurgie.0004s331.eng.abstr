Micronervereconstruction of motor and sensitive nerves in the head and neck area today has an established range of indications. Surgical procedures of external and internal neurolyses, nerve coaptation and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized. With microneurosurgery of motor nerves, satisfying or good results can be generally obtained. Success rates exceeding 50% following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures, more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient. Perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts, e.g., by development of minimally invasive, eventually endoscopically guided procedures. Allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied. Initial experiments with nerve distractions are encouraging. A better understanding of nerve lesions on cellular and molecular biological levels may improve our knowledge of posttraumatic regulatory procedures and may lead to future possibilities of nonsurgical treatment options for peripheral and central nerve lesions by guided regeneration.
