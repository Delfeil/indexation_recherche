Abstract.  Initial examination of an andrological patient revealed high-grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and ureaplasma infection. An elevated FSH level and significantly reduced testicular size were indicative of severely damaged testicular parenchyma. The presence of macrophages in the sperm smear was interpreted as a sign of chronic epididymitis. Antibiotic couple therapy with doxycycline, followed by a 3-month recovery period with combined treatment with vitamin C and E and zinc, resulted in a significantly improved spermiogram. After another 2 months intrauterine insemination resulted in pregnancy, and the birth of a healthy daughter followed. Preparation of the ejaculate was done by glasswool filtration. At that time, the patient had only mild teratozoospermia.
