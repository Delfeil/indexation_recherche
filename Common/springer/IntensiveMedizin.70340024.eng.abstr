 Excessive bleeding frequently complicates the care of critically-ill patients. Except in the case of trauma or in patients with known coagulopathies (e.g., hemophilia), the bleeding is generally not directly related to the illness that results in admission to the intensive care unit. In general, the causes of the bleeding can be divided into 3 categories: consumptive coagulopathies (e.g., DIC), bleeding related to "hepatic issues" (i.e., liver dysfunction, vitamin K deficiency), and iatrogenic causes. This review will discuss the more common causes of bleeding in the critically-ill patient and outline diagnostic and treatment approaches for these patients. New experimental data linking activation of the coagulation and inflammatory systems with the development of multisystem organ failure is briefly discussed.
