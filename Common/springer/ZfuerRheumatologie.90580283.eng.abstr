 Precision of osteodensitometric measurements using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) depends on various known factors, such as positioning, aortic calcification or vertebral fractures. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of various diseases or bone density on the reproducibility of measurements in the lumbar spine and the proximal femur.  Measurements in the LWS p.a., LWS lat. and at Ward's triangle were made in a total of 100 patients. The subjects were repositioned between measurements. In order to be able to determine the influence of various diseases, four groups of 25 patients each were formed: three with the diagnosis osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and one control group. The mean percentual difference and coefficient of variation were calculated as the measure for reproducibility.  Mean percentual differences of 0.18 to 2.6% were found in the four groups at the three measurements sites. After calculation of coefficient of variation, a value between 1.2 and 2.7% was found for LWS p.a., between 7.1 and 15.7% for LWS lat. and between 4.1 and 9.9% at Ward's triangle. It was also conspicuous that the difference in coefficient of variation in osteoporosis patients was nearly double that in the control group in all measured areas. Conclusion: Lateral lumbar spinal measurements using DEXA cannot presently be recommended. LWS p.a. measurements and, with limitations, measurements at Ward's triangle have good precision and could be used for course documentation of bone density.
