Monitoring of pH of the esophagus is a routine diagnostic procedure, whereas until now pH-monitoring of the hypopharynx has been used only for scientific research. In the present study a critical evaluation scale was used to record the results of 112 patients who underwent pH monitoring to determine possible reflux. Since high refluxes often remain unnoticed clinically, further study is required in certain cases. The extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx. In such cases 24-h pH monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of "gastric laryngitis".
