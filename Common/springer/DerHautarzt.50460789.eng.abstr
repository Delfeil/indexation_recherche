Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly; it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin. Several clinical variants of BP have been described, and we now add our observations of two BP cases mimicking subacute prurigo. Both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic excoriated papules for several months before presentation. Blisters had never developed and did not occur during follow up. Histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis. In the serum of both patients, indirect immunofluorescence on NaCl-separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters. Perilesional skin biopsies showed linear IgG or C3 deposits in the basement membran zone. Immunoblotting of epidermal and dermal extracts demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230-kD protein, which is the known major bullous pemphigoid antigen. These cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid.
