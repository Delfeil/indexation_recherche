 The contribution of inhalation injury to the mortality of severely burned patients is very high (approximately 80% of the fatalities). The injury to the tracheobronchial system with concomitant burn injury leads to a progressive lung edema. The edema and the state of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in trauma patients favours the incidence of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is likewise afflicted with a mortality of 20-90%. The cause for the development of an ARDS is a deficiency of lung surfactant proteins. The lack of surfactant leads to an increase of surface tension, alveolar collapse, rising airway resistance and a decrease of the lungs' compliance. This situation aggravates the airway obstruction and formation of atelectases caused by edema. Due to the SIRS, the surfactant system is further compromised by inflammatory degradation and inhibition. The lung injury with following ARDS builds the foundation for life threatening multiple organ failure (MOF).   The therpeutic approach to ARDS is limited and consists of pressure controlled ventilation, permissive hypercapnia, patient positioning, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and the treatment of the underlying disease, in this case the immediate excision of the burn wounds. Results from animal experiments and uncontrolled clinical studies indicate that the patient with inhalation injury could benefit from high dose Ambroxol treatment or hyperbaric oxygenation. Furthermore, inhalative corticosteroid treatment is undisputed but not the systemic approach. There is no effective specific pharmacologic therapy of an inhalation injury following ARDS.   In our study on four severely burned patients with inhalation injury and ARDS, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that intrabronchial application of a bovine surfactant preparation produces a sudden, and in some cases lasting, improvement in gas exchange. The clinical course of ARDS was influenced to avoid a state of no return with complications such as MOF and the high risk for an early fatal outcome. In view of the results the use of natural/recombinant surfactant in combination with a systemic antiinflammatory therapy of the capillary leak, as an emergency measure, seems to be a promising approach in cases of inhalation injury and merits further studies.
