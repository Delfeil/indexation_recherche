Abstract.  In comparison to pancreatic cancer, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has a better prognosis and a higher resection rate, but it is tainted with the occurrence of metachronic tumors. Metachronic tumors of the female genitalia are described in the literature, but metachronic gastric cancer after curative treatment of cholangiocacinoma is also possible.
