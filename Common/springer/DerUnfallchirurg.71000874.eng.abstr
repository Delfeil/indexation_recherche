Mechanical irritations of the supraspinatus tendon due to a reduction of the subacromial space are considered to be a potential cause of supraspinatus outlet syndrome. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to provide a method of improved measurement of the acromiohumeral distance and the evaluation of the acromial shape. In seven patients aged 50-60 years with unilateral supraspinatus outlet syndrome, imaging with standardized, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) was performed in order to demonstrate the acromion and the subacromial space three-dimensionally. The acromiohumeral distance was measured in three reconstructed frontal sections, and the two sides of each patient were directly compared. The acromial shape was compared with the classification of Bigliani as derived from conventional radiography.
