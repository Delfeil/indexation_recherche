 Introduction: Traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee. The indications for operative and conservative treatment are still controversial. Methods and results: From 1974 to 1994, 38 patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department. Thirty-four of these patients were followed up for 3-16 years (mean: 8.6 years). In 29 cases of the follow-up group, reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments was performed. In the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone. At the time of follow-up, 90 % of the patients showed good knee stability, but 90 % had lack of motion as well. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis was mostly mild to moderate. Thirty-five percents of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the Lysholm Score. Conclusions: Positive prognostic factors were an age less than 40 years at the time of the accident, a low-energy trauma, e. g., a sports-related injury, early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments, and initial postoperative functional treatment.
