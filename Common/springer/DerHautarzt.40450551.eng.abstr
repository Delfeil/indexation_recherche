Abstract.  A 62-year-old woman developed eosinophilic cellulitis of her right arm, accompanied by systemic signs (fever, leucocytosis) and massive restriction of the motility of her right shoulder joint. Sonography and computed tomography revealed massive cutaneous and subcutaneous oedema, and accumulations of fluid around the deep muscular fasciae, interstices and (less severe) within the joint. High-dose systemic corticosteroid treatment led to rapid clearing of the skin lesions, and joint motility was restored several weeks later. This is the first case of eosinophilic cellulitis in which involvement of deep structures adjacent to joints has been demonstrated by modern imaging techniques.
