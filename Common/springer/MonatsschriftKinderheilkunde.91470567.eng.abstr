In children with horseshoe kidneys Wilms' tumors can be observed 2 to 8-times more often. Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue. We report about a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms' tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications. The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross-section imagings. Both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms'tumor.
