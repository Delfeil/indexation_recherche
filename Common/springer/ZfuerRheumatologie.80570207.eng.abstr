 Over the past years, antioxidants, and particularly vitamin E, have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases. In rheumatology, interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. However, the concept of using antioxidant nutrients as potential remedies is not new. As early as the sixties, first case reports have described beneficial effects of vitamin E in the therapy of osteoarthritis. Nonetheless, most of the following studies were not conducted properly, thus, not allowing valid inferences about the efficacy of vitamin E. Newer studies with sound methodology have shown a beneficial effect in rheumatic diseases, mainly in the reduction of pain. This paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin E in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.
