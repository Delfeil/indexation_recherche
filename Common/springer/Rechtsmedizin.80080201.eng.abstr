 The disaster management in Germany is embodied in the constitution. According to the German constitution the ministries of the interior of the federal states coordinate the disaster management by delegating it to the city and county administrations. These elaborate and update a special disaster management calendar, which allows a prompt flow of information to and from the administration and the person in charge of operations and guarantees a smooth collaboration on which the success of the operation depends.
