 The polyvinylalcohol (PVAL) method for sampling gunshot residues from the hands was used in 30 investigations involving 22 suicides, 3 accidents and 5 homicides. In these cases 16 pistols, 7 revolvers, 2 shotguns and 2 rifles had been used. The small calibres (.22 lr to 7.65 mm) represented 75% of the arms. In two cases lead-free primers had deposited zink-containing residues. PVAL gloves were examined by microradiography and chemographical analysis. The PVAL method was successful in 29 cases and assisted in the majority of cases to reconstruct the position of the arm during shooting. Additionally, 16 other pairs of hands were treated with adhesive films. In 6 cases of suicide the films showed lead-containing traces and gave evidence of shooting. It was also possible to reconstruct an accident with lead-free ammunition. In 3 out of the 9 cases of criminal shooting the adhesive films did not contain gunshot residues. The amount of traces on the films did not reach the yield of traces fixed by PVAL. PVAL gloves showed better and more stable staining results. The adhesive films did not work if there was too much blood on the hands. The staining results of these bloody films were not satisfactory.
