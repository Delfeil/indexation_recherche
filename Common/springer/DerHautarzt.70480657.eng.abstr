A 19-year old caucasian patient suffered from ulceration and scaring of his fingers since age two. During childhood, fibrosing contractures on the phalanges developed. Since puberty, his eunuch-like stature, bird-like face and exophthalmos had become under obvious. His hair was extraordinarily fine; his pubic hair rare. Radiological examination revealed ankylosis and osteoporosis of the phalanges and carpals. Angiography showed occlusion of multiple digital and interdigital arteries. Furthermore, a bilateral posterior cataract, restrictive respiratory disease, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperuricemia, proteinuria and primary hypogonadism were diagnosed. These findings are characteristic for the premature aging syndromes. The cardial symptoms of tall stature, bird-like face, pseudoexophthalmos, skleroderma-like and poikiloderma-like cutaneous lesions, scarce hair growth, early diabetes mellitus and arteriosclerosis led to the diagnosis of metageria.
