 The morphological changes in the lung in ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome) require an appropriate adaptation of the mechanical ventilation. In this review different options of modifying mechanical ventilation are shown. The pathophysiological mechanisms of ARDS and their partially resulting treatment modalities are explained. They consist of reducing inspiratory pressure and tidal volume, the application of positive end-exspiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation in prone position. The indications and contraindications of permissive hypercapnia and nitric oxide (NO) are discussed. As another therapeutic approach, the superimposed spontaneous breathing and new modes of ventilatory support are discussed.
