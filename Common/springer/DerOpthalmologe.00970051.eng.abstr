Background: For cataract surgery in this country retro- and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method. It totally stops eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain. Especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications, but the potential risks can be severe. In the past sponge anesthesia could not be used on patients with difficult cataract surgery due to the insufficient anesthetic effect. A modified anesthetic method is demonstrated for complicated cataract surgery.
