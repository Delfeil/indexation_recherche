Miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today. Apart from easy handling, in the majority of cases it also ensures adequate fracture stability. The treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent. Titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures. Compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry. The titanium mesh can be adapted and screwed individually in any situation, in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates. As a result, complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent.
