 The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability (HRV) and on left ventricular function in 14 patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). After a 3- to 4-week titration period, carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily, or the highest dose tolerated (at least 25mg daily). Maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks. Digital 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy. HRV for the entire 24-hour period was computed in the time domain using the Oxford Medilog Excel 2 analysis system. Measures of HRV included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), and the proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing >50ms (pNN50).
