Background: Single-dose spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric local anaesthetic provides profound analgesia and motor blockade and allows exact assessment of the analgesic level. The present prospective, randomised study compares a mixture of plain 0.5% bupivacaine and hyperbaric 4% mepivacaine with hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine with regard to onset time of analgesia and duration of the sensory and motor blockade.
