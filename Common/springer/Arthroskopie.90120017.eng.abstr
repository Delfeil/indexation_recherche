Long term results after arthroscopic débridement of the knee for evaluating the operative outcome in arthritis of grade III or IV are still missing. In the present retrospective study, patients who met specific criteria were evaluated for examination. Of 452 patients, 182 treated by arthroscopic débridement of the knee joint were reviewed. The average age was 63.2 years and follow-up had a minimum of 10 years. All patients were monitored using a subjective rating scale, a standardized scoring scale, and radiographs of the knee. Criteria for the study were a medial and lateral gonarthrosis of grade III or IV without meniscal tears. Only 10 patients (5.5%) were still satisfied with the operative result (subjective analog scale), whereas 54 patients (29.7%) reported a good result up to 5 years after arthroscopy. 131 cases (72%) rated their results as good for up to one year. Almost one third of patients (28%) reported no relief of pain at all. Generally, the mean scoring scale decreased from preoperatively 44 points (max. 100) to 23 points postoperatively. The radiographic outcome showed that in nearly all cases the preoperative arthrosis had increased at time of follow-up. In comparing the results there was no significant age difference and no significant difference in the frequency of severe articular surface degeneration or duration of complaints (p > 0.05). Results of arthroscopic therapies reported in literature are different due to the fact that studies contain patients of different osteoarthritic conditions mixed with additional meniscal tears and a follow-up ranging from 1-2 years. With the following study we report on patients with an isolated grade II or IV arthritis who underwent arthroscopic débridement of the knee. With a follow-up of  10 years it is possible for the surgeon and the patient to estimate the success rate of an arthroscopic débridement individually, which might end up in a total replacement of the  knee.
