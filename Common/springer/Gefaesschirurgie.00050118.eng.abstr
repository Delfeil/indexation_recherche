 Lymphatic fistula is one of the most common complications after vertebral surgery of the distal segment. We compared the number of lymphatic fistulas after reconstructions of the distal vertebral artery (VA) in two periods: 1985-1991 and 1992-1997. Since 1992, we ligated every structure suspected to be a lymph vessel. From 1985 to 1997, a total number of 361 operations on the distal VA were performed: 105 operations on the right and 256 on the left side. In the first period, 133 distal VA reconstructions were performed out of which 7 patients (5.2%) showed a lymphatic fistula. In the second period, 228 distal VA reconstructions were performed out of which 6 patients (2.6%) suffered from a lymphatic fistula. We were able to decrease the complications of lymphatic fistulas from 5.2% to 2.6% in the past. On one hand this is due to the growing experience of the performing surgeon and on the other hand due to the application of a ligature to any lymph vessel.
