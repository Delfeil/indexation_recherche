 With the availability of methods to quantitate microbes in urine, one has come to recognize that a certain proportion of apparently healthy individuals have bacteria in their urine in the absence of any clinical symptoms. By definition, asymptomatic bacteriuria is present, if on 1, 2 or more consecutive occasions > 100,000 colony forming units/ml are found in aseptically collected midstream urine, granted that the same microorgamism is isolated. Such asymptomatic bacteriuria is found in 2.7% of women aged between 15 and 24 years and increases to 20 to 50% in women above an age of 80 years. In men the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is considerably lower, but increases to 6 to 20% above the age of 80 years. The microbe most frequently involved in asymptomatic bacteriuria is Escherichia coli, which is characterized by the expression of multiple virulence factors. In this respect they differ from bacteria found in patients with lower or upper urinary tract infections.
