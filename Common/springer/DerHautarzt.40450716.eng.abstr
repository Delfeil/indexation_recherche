Abstract.  Pacemaker erythema is a rare, irreversible side effect of cardiac pacemakers, clinically characterized by epifocal teleangiectatic erythema. Histology reveals teleangiectatic vessels in the superficial dermis and a slight perivascular infiltrate. We report on three patients presenting with pacemaker erythema following either pacemaker or defibrillator implantation. The pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown. In contrast to peri- or postoperative pacemaker infections, physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism. Allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results.
