 The following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability. A model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis. The concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive. Four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO), our preferred method of treatment of unstable Colles fracture. Biocompatible osteosynthesis was achieved with an invasivity and stability comparable to that of KWO. In conclusion, injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects. Regarding the recent developments in injectable materials for osteosynthesis it offers the best perspective for clinical application.
