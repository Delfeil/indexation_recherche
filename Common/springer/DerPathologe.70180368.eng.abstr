Tumour-like lesions of the salivary glands are diseases which, in accordance with the new WHO classification of salivary gland tumours, can simulate a true tumour by swelling or induration of the salivary gland tissue. An additional rare entity, only recently not described in the new WHO classification, is "sclerosing polycystic sialadenopathy" (s.p.s.) which, especially in younger patients, results in nodular, incompletely encapsulated, tumour-like masses mainly of the parotid gland. Histologically, it is comparable to fibrocystic mastopathy and is characterized by distinct hyalinized, centrally accentuated sclerosing collageneous tissue with inclusion of cystically ectatic ducts and focal epithelial hyperplasia. In the hyperplastic ducts, transluminal bridges and cribriform patterns can develop, sometimes also apocrine secretion and eosinophilic globules. The s.p.s. must be distinguished mainly from cystadenoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma and also from dysgenetic cystic parotid gland. Based on four of our own observations the differential diagnosis is analysed.
