The term Langerhans cell histiocytosis, previously "Histiocytosis X", encompasses three different syndromes: eosinophilic granuloma of bone, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Abt-Letterer Siwe disease. All are rare manifestations in childhood. We report on a 10 year old boy presenting with a swelling in the occipital region and clinical signs of elevated intracranial pressure. The tentative diagnosis after examination, conventional radiologic procedures and computerized tomography was eosinophilic granuloma. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging-angiography revealed the acute threat to the child caused by the intracranial expanding mass lesion with almost complete obstruction of the confluens sinuum. Thrombosis and the risk of bleeding were decreased by early and complete exstirpation of the tumor. After two years follow-up, no new lesions had appeared.
