Abstract.  Although long-term results in cruciate ligament surgery are continuously improving, we are still confronted with a certain rate of surgical failures and an increasing number of revision procedures. Despite a tremendous effort towards experimental and clinical research in the field of anterior and posterior cruciate ligament surgery over the past decades, there is still a strong need to further improve results. Therefore, the goal of the present paper is to introduce and discuss new developments in the rapidly changing field of cruciate ligament surgery, in order to give the clinician a base for discussion to include these developments in their daily clinical work. The present paper focuses on current developments and future perspectives such as biodegradable implants, new aspects in graft selection, double-bundle posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, possibilities of biological intervention with growth factors, and the new technology of robotics and navigation.
