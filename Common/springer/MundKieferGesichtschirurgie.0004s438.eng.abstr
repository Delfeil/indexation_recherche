Total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following Le Fort I osteotomy in CLP patients are frequent and major complications. The aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement. Maxillary distraction was performed in 12 patients. In two cases, a Delaire mask was used to bring the maxilla forward, ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by Polley. In all patients, planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved; one partial relapse occurred. The results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability. The technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure.
