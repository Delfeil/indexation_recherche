Between April 1994 and December 1995 14 patients (average age 56 (41-71) years, 13 women, one man) suffering from a fracture of the distal radius (Extensionsfracture, type 1B by Pechlaner, AO-classification A2 and A3) were treated by minimal invasiv procedure. The bone defect was substituted with hydroxylapatit ceramic. In a prospective study the osteointegration of the alloplastic bone graft was evaluated radiographically and on MRI. Up to week 12 X-ray revealed a radiolucenty around the allograft in all patients. After 6 months trabecular structure reached the alloplastic bone graft in 57 % of the patients. After one year the surface of the hydroxylapatit ceramic was remodelled in 36 % of the patients. At this time MRI examination with contrast agent demonstrated marginal integration of the alloplastic bone craft in 71 %. X-ray follow up showed stageable integration of the porous hydroxylapatit ceramic. MRI examination demonstrated partial osteointegration. Hydroxylapatit ceramic was incorporated in radial metaphyse of elder patients without any complications.
