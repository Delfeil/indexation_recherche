 The application of an adjustable silicone gastric band is a very efficient and long-term method to reduce the weight in morbid obesity. The surgical technique is exacting; standardization of the procedure diminishes the complication rate. 370 patients with morbid obesity underwent the laparoscopic application of a gastric band between May 1996 and September 1997. Two different kinds of gastric bands were used in these surgeries. The data are shown in two series. The total morbidity rate was 16.8 %, in series II 4.5 %. The mortality rate was 0 %. The average loss of weight came to 12 kg (5.3 %) after 4 weeks, 18 % after 3 months, 37.4 % after 6 months and 48.4 % after 1 year.
