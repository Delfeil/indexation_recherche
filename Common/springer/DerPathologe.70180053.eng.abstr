The long-term disease free survival in patients treated by breast conserving therapy is similar to that of patients treated by mastectomy. In breast conserving therapie there is a significant risk of local recurrence. Although local recurrence does not appear to effect survival, there is certainly associated morbidity and attendant emotional trauma. Microscopic evaluation of the margins of lumpectomy specimens is the only way to define the extent of the tumour and the adequacy of resection.
