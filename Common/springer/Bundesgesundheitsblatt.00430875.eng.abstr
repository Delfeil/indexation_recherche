According to the former notification procedures, most notifiable infectious diseases (with the exception of HIV) were reported to the local health authorities.With the institution of the new Protection against infection Act (IPA) the diagnosis of a number of infectious pathogens will be reported anonymous directly to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).These mandatory notifications refer to the diagnosis of Treponema pallidum, HIV, Echinococcus sp., Plasmodium sp., Rubellavirus (only connatal infections) and Toxoplasma gondii (only connatal infections).The head of the facility conducting the diagnostic test (laboratory) is responsible for the carrying out of the notification. In order to obtain all information required in the notification, the physician, who is sending in the material for testing, is required by law, to support the person responsible for carrying out of the notification by supplying the necessary data. First, the laboratory fills out the notification form with all the available information and sends the original to the RKI.  Then, together with the test results, a copy of the notification is sent to the physician who initiated the diagnostic test.The physician completes any missing data in the form and sends this copy to the RKI. By doing so the physician has fulfilled his obligation to support the notification process.This new reporting system will yield better data about infectious pathogens that do not require direct intervention by the local health authorities.  In order to obtain reliable data, it is important that all physicians support the notification process.
