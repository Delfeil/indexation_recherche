Non-unions in the proximity of the elbow are very rare and in most cases caused by mistakes in initial treatment. Reconstruction after pseudarthrosis of the elbow continues to pose a challenge for any surgeon. The aim of our study was to analyze the initial mistakes and to underline the most important aspects of reconstructive surgery. In a retrospective study over a defined period of 10 years (1/1985 to 12/1994) we were able to treat altogether 27 non-unions in the proximity of the elbow. These patients were transferred to our hospital at an average of 44 weeks after initial therapy elsewhere.The main symptoms were in 17 cases pain and in all other patients functional deficit. Reconstructive surgery was performed an average 54 weeks after the primary injury. In 24 out of 27 cases a re-osteosynthesis, in 12 an arthrolysis , in 7 a neurolysis and in 2 cases an arthroplasty was needed. The patient could return to work an average 18 weeks after the operation and 53 weeks after injury. The initial complaints were reduced in 24 of 27 cases, with a significant improvement in the ROM and functional outcome according to the Mayo Elbow Performance Index.
