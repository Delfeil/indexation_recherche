Abstract.  A patient suffering from long-standing pustular psoriasis of the palms was treated for 3 weeks with a mercury-containing drug. Exacerbation into generalized pustular psoriasis developed. Mercury levels in blood and urine were increased. After withdrawal of the mercury preparation, therapy with DMPA (2,3-Dimercapto-1-propane-sulfonic acid), a mercury antidote, was initiated, together with short-term treatment with aromatic retinoids and PUVA. Within a few days mercury levels decreased significantly and the skin lesions practically disappeared.
