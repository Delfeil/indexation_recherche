 Late onset of adult Still's Disease is characterized by fever, arthralgia, typical rash and leukocytosis as major criteria, and sore throat, lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly, liver dysfunction and the absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody as minor criteria. A 20 year old man presented with tonsillitis followed by perimyocarditis, which was borderline by myocardial biopsy, typical ECG changes with negative T-waves in the left precordial leads and a slightly reduced left ventricular function echocardiographically. Because of high temperature and neutrophilia he was initially treated for bacterial infection with different regimens of antibiotics. In the clinical follow up he developed other symptoms like elevation of liver enzymes and arthralgia. These symptoms together with persistent fever, elevated leukocytes and a severe inflammatory process despite antibiotic therapy and negative rheumatoid factor as well as negative antinuclear factors led to the diagnosis of Still's Disease after exclusion of a hematological disease by bone marrow examination. After starting high dose corticoid therapy, the fever decreased promptly and patient feels well since then. This case shows that in patients initially presenting with perimyocarditis after upper respiratory tract infection, the very rare differential diagnosis of late onset of Still's Disease has to be contemplated.
