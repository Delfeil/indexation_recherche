One of the most important occupations of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints. Such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or mobilisations. The pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion. Objective criteria for the diagnosis of disturbed spinal mobility are missing. They are not detectable in X-ray, computertomography or NMR.
