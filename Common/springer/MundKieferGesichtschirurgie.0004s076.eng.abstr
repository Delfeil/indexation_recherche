The presentation of vascular and neural malformations in an understandable terminology permits accurate diagnosis, proper treatment, individualized prognosis, and also stimulates studies of pathogenesis. The descriptive classification includes: NF 1 and NF 2; hemangiomas, low- and high-flow vascular malformations, combined malformations, and hypertrophy; and syndromes such as, Parkes Weber, Klippel-Trénaunay, Maffuci's, and multiple dysplasia syndromes. Lymphatic malformations are abnormalities of lymphatic development. The list of treatment includes surgical and nonsurgical treatment. Not all vascular malformations can be successfully treated. Coping with NF is a challenge for both, affected individuals and health care professionals. NF is often associated with a myriad of anomalies that present a lot of problems for plastic surgery. In certain cases watchful waiting seems justified but not in cases of severe problems, giant growth, and local complications.
