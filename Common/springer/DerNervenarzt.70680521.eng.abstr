Dystonia rarely is a consequence of head trauma. In most of these patients lesions of the contralateral caudate or putamen are found. We report a 27-year-old patient who displayed focal dystonia of the right hand with a latency of four months after he had sustained a severe head trauma. The development of a lesion in the contralateral dorsolateral thalamus within the first weeks after the craniocerebral injury is demonstrated with sequential computertomographic and magnetic resonance imaging. There were no lesions of the caudate or the putamen.
