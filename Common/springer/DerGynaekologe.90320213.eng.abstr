Three-dimensional imaging with the capacity for automatic data acquisition and volume storage provides the possibility of analyzing structures tomographically in certain steps. Sectional planes that cannot be demonstrated by conventional ultrasound can be calculated and displayed from the volume memory. In addition, three-dimensional images may be calculated using the surface and transparent mode. With those different viewing modes and permanent storage of the acquired volumes, the transvaginal  3-D technique offers a precise diagnosis in early pregnancy.
