This paper gives a report on the current views of psychosomatic theories on chronic pain. Based on Melzack's and Wall's "gate-control theory", Freud's ideas on hysteric neurosis, and Engel's "pain-prone patient" the unidirectional nociceptive model of pain is replaced by a kybernetic system of bio-psycho-social etiology. The psychodynamic theories of pain-proneness, the narcissistic mechanism in the etiology of pain, the mechanism of conversion, states of psycho-vegetative tension and processes of learning are presented. In addition the impact of gain from illness, life-events, coping, the doctors behavior and the comorbidity of affective disorders on pain syndromes becoming chronic is pointed out. As an example the multifactorial etiology of chronic low back pain is demonstrated.
