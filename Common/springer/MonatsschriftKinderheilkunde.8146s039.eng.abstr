Nucleotides are low molecular weight biological compounds that play major roles in almost all-biological processes. Cell nucleic acids and nucleotides are continuously synthesised, degraded and salvaged. The body's pools derive from three potential sources: synthesis de novo, salvage (recycling of preformed bases) and the diet. It is generally accepted that de novo synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines from amino acid precursors is capable of supporting the cellular needs for nucleic acid synthesis. When protein intake is decreased or in situations in which there are a high demand of nucleotides synthesis (after gut injury, after surgical trauma, sepsis, rapid growth: pregnancy or newborn infants, etc.) some tissues with a rapid turnover (gut and immune system) may increase the salvage of exogenous nucleotides coming from the diet. Therefore, nucleotides may become conditionally essential nutrients. This article discusses the possible beneficial effects of dietary nucleotides on small intestine (maturation and recovery) and gut microflora, lipid and hepatic metabolism and on the immune system. Human milk is the best source of nucleotides for young infants and the nucleotide/nucleoside profile of it shows a substantial predominance for pyrimidines as compared to purines. Moreover, pyrimidine nucleotides seem to be better preserved in breast milk during storage in the breast and during digestion in the small intestine and they are more absorbed and incorporated into tissue RNA, as compared to purine ones. Additional research should be done to improve the design of nucleotides supplemented infant formulas. This includes: 1) to investigate in vivo if the incorporation of dietary nucleotides in tissue RNA is enhanced in situations of stress or rapid growth and 2) to study the biological effects of individually administered purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.
