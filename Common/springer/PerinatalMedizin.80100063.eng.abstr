In animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs. According to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today, it could potentially be applied in infants in the future, too. However, the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase III studies to be conducted. Further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems. Taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today, we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support; however, further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified.
