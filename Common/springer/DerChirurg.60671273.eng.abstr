 Malignant mixed Müllerian tumours (MMMT) are tumours of the female genital tract which rarely occur in extragenital sites. We report a case of a 46-year-old female with MMMT with primary occurrence in the greater omentum. Only 19 cases of primary extragenital manifestation of this tumour are described in the literature. The clinical appearance, diagnosis, therapy, histological evaluation and histogenesis are discussed.
