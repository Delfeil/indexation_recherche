 Recognition of the potential for ventilator-associated lung injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has stimulated the debate on the appropriate strategies of mechanical ventilation in these patients. This review summarizes new aspects of research on ventilator-associated lung injury and provides an overview of recent prospective, randomized, controlled trials. Methods and principles guiding ventilatory support like pressure-limited mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) as well as adjunctive, non-ventilatory therapies like inhaled nitric oxide (NO) or administration of exogenous surfactant are discussed.
