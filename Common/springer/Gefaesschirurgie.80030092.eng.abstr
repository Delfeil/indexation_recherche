 Introduction: Clinical neurologic stage and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of stenoses of extracerebral arteries are the gold standard for the indication for internal carotid artery (ICA) thrombend arterectomy (TEA). Patients and materials: We included patients with unilateral ICA stenosis (36 men and two women; age, 55-85 years; average age, 71 years) in a prospective study to validate the preoperative estimation of plaque morphology according to color coded duplex sonography (CCDS) and B-mode sonography (BS) by postoperative histopathologic findings in the plaque cylinders derived from TEA in the eversion technique. Results: The estimation of the degree of ICA stenosis was an average of 5% below the angiographically and histopathologically determined value. The sensitivity (90%) and specificity rates (94%) of CCDS with respect to plaque inhomogeneity were higher than those of DSA findings (sensitivity, 15%; specificity, 83.3%). A higher degree of plaque inhomogeneity was not associated with a higher degree of stenosis (p=0.85). No significant correlation between the degree of ICA stenosis and the clinical neurologic stage was found (p=0.94). The relationship between plaque inhomogeneity and the occurrence of neurologic deficiencies was highly significant (p<0.001). Discussion and conclusion: The relevance of this relationship is currently being discussed. With the high accuracy of CCDS and BS with respect to plaque inhomogeneity with a positive predictive value of 94.7% and its potential relevance in terms of clinical stage, ultrasound findings might improve the indication process for prophylactic surgery of the carotid artery.
