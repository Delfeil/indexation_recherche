 Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) helps to diagnose severe genetic diseases in vitro. Prenatal diagnosis can be done as early as the early cleavage stages. Only those diseases that mean a severe condition for the newborn child should be indications to perform a PGD cycle. The routine techniques of PGD, especially biopsy techniques, polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence in situ hybridization and modifications of these techniques are discussed in this article.
