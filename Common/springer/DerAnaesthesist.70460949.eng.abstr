In order to perform accurate low-flow anaesthesia ventilation, it is desirable to avoid the influence of fresh gas flow (FGF) and inspiration duration (ID) on the resulting minute volume (MV). The Sulla 808V anaesthesia ventilator (Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) is originally not equipped with a fresh-gas decoupling (FGD) device. Therefore, changes of FGF and ID settings applied during controlled ventilation may lead to alterations of the resulting MV. Recently, a low-cost FGD device (Carbamed, Bern-Liebefeld, Switzerland) has been developed, which can be inserted into the circle system. We investigated the effect of this device on MV in the Sulla 808V anaesthesia apparatus.
