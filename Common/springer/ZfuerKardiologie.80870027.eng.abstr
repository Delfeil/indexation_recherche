 Twiddler's syndrome is a rare complication in patients with pacemakers. We report this very rare syndrome in a patient with pectoral implanted unipolar cardioverter defibrillator. This syndrome was detected because the patient presented in the 3 month routine visit an exitblock with an increased pacing impedance. The defibrillation threshold remained unchanged. The chest x-ray revealed an inferolaterally migrated generator with a multiply rotated lead. The intraoperative exploration showed a generator which was rotated nine-fold around its longitudinal axis with a multiple twisted unipolar lead. The lead was substituted and the aggregate fixed with a suture to the underlying muscle fascia. An atrophy of the pectoralis muscle was found in this patient which previously resulted from a long hospital stay. This atrophy was identified as a possible risk factor for the development of Twiddler's syndrome, a rare complication in patients with pectoral ICD, may become a significant problem in these patients as it is for pacemaker patients but with more serious possible consequences.
