  Cerebral microdialysis is a potent research tool in experimental neurobiology and is now also introduced in intraoperative monitoring and neurointensive care. The method has the potential to be used as focal monitoring of intact brain or of brain regions of therapeutic interest. Our work includes experimental assessment of sensitive parameters as glucose, lactate, glucose-lactate index, and pH of dialysates. The investigation included focal cerebral ischemia, intracerebral and subdural haematoma, and glutamate neurotoxicity. The clinical work used intraoperative monitoring to assess normal value ranges, pathophysiologic ranges, and neurochemical monitoring in neurointensive patients. Our experience shows that some neurochemical cases monitored with microdialysis show early changes, in three cases even anticipating clinical worsening. We conclude that cerebral microdialysis has a future in our field.
