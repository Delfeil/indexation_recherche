 After acute renal injury, renal expression of several growth factors becomes transiently altered. The increased expression of some growth factors and/or their receptors at sites of nephron injury suggests important contributions of these peptides to the natural repair process. Exogenously administered IGF-I, EGF or HGF each have been shown to accelerate the recovery of renal function in animal models of acute renal failure. The mechanisms of action of these peptides in acute renal failure appear to include the resetting of the cell cycle clock by activating cyclin-dependent kinases inducing transition through the G1/S-restriction point, which results in mitosis. Growth factors support differentiation of newly formed tubular cells, down-regulate apoptosis, and improve renal hemodynamics. However, two recent clinical trials of rhIGF-I in acute renal failure had disappointing results. Although experimental data support the therapeutic utility of recombinant growth factors in acute renal failure, further experimental research and especially clinical trials are necessary.
