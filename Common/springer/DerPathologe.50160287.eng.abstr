Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina. Only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix, where they are most commonly seen in adolescence. Their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. We report a case of cervical embryonal rhabdomysarcoma in IRS stage Ia in a 32-year-old female. After surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months. The case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features, and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed.
