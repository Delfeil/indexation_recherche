There is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases. For dermatological patients such data are not available. In early spring 1998 we studied the psychological changes in 247 hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the Ruhr University Bochum. We used the German version of the internationally accepted Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. We found the prevalance of psychological alterations ranged between 25,9% and 31%. The prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological, cardiological or neurological patient populations. Surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or angiological diseases. These results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated.
