Abstract  The Mainz Emergency Evaluation Score has shown to be a reliable instrument in examining the quality of outcome in Emergency Medicine patients. However its use in pediatric emergencies is limited, since the physiologic parameters used in the MEES classification do not always correlate with these age groups. This counts in particular for the evaluation of respiration and circulation. In order to transfer the MEES concept to pediatric emergencies, age specific threshold levels are defined for the heart rate. Measurement of blood pressure in children can be replaced by documenting the condition of pulse; and the respiration rate, by searching for clinical signs of respiratory failure. This way the emergency physician has simple criteria to evaluate the course of vital functions, by which the pattern of the MEES is met and the effort of documentation is only marginally increased.
