 A 67year-old man with known coronary artery disease presented with an episode of wide QRS tachycardia with left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology associated with dyspnea, angina and near syncope which terminated spontaneously on arrival in the emergency room. The differential diagnosis consisted of (1) ventricular tachycardia or (2) supraventricular tachycardia with either aberrant conduction or anterograde conduction via an accessory connection. During invasive electrophysiologic testing, programmed ventricular stimulation reproducibly induced the clinical tachycardia with LBBB morphology and a cycle length of 342ms. Retrograde conduction via a concealed left-sided accessory connection was confirmed. During tachycardia, sensed ventricular extrastimulation induced a sudden increase in tachycardia cycle length associated with loss of LBBB. This (paradoxical) increase in tachycardia cycle length with loss of ipsilateral bundle branch block during orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia was due to the additional presence of dual AV node physiology and switch from anterograde fast to anterograde slow pathway conduction. The LBBB was most likely due to the `linking phenomenon' which was interrupted by the right ventricular extrastimulus. The accessory connection was successfully ablated within the proximal coronary sinus, and typical or atypical AV node reentry could not be induced. Thus, slow pathway ablation was not performed.
