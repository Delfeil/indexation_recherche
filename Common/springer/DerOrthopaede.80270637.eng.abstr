As shown in long term follow-up studies of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA), the femoropatellar joint is an important problem. We report our experience over the past seven years not having resurfaced the patella at the primary TKA at all. Between 1990 and 1997 more than 700 consecutive TKA with the De Puy New Jersey LCS prosthesis were performed. A standardised lateral approach with osteotomy of the tibial tuberosity was used. The patella was redressed, either denervated or left untouched. In no case a primary patellar resurfacing was performed. X-rays of the patello-femoral joint showed a remodelling of the patella over the years, nicely matching the condylar design of the femoral prosthesis. Using a blood-supply-preserving approach and a biomechanically adequate implant, TKA without patellar replacement gives excellent long-term results.
