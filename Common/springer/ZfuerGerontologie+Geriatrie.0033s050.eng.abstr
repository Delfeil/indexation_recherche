 During recent years in the German federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms. The hospital sector - as an element of this system - has also been affected. Based on various legislation the financial framework has been reduced which has led to tendencies of economic limitation and rationalization. From this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result. Cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and dicharged to outpatient services despite unknown domestic follow-up care. Mostly the elderly are affected. Medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between SGB V and SGB XI. However, this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit payment (rehabilitation before nursing, priority of home, etc.). Right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors. Various medical, nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation.
