To minimize the risk of visual loss and to stop the progression of diabetic retinopathy argon laser treatment is the therapy of choice in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The results after panretinal argon laser coagulation (ALC) were studied retrospectively considering visual outcome and frequencies of diabetic ocular complications. In all 95 patients were included in whom laser treatment had been performed due to clinically and angiographically diagnosed proliferative diabetic retinopathy at the Department of Ophthalmology between 1990 and 1994 with a follow-up of at least 1 year. The most frequent diabetic complications observed were vitreous haemorrhage in 9 (or 9.5%) and iris neovascularization in 10 cases (or 10.5%). Rare complications were neovascular glaucoma in 3 patients (or 3.2%) and tractional retinal detachment in 4 patients (or 4.2%). Nearly 70% of the patients maintained or improved visual acuity after laser treatment. The frequency of diabetic complications of PDR after ALC was significantly associated with older age, diabetes type II, longer duration of diabetes and elevated blood pressure.
