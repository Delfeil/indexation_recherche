 The case of a 64-year-old woman who aspirated a moderate amount of barium sulfate contrast medium during a x-ray barium swallow is presented. After an initially inconspicious clinical course the patient died 35 h later of respiratory insufficiency from aspiration pneumonia. Only a few reports of fatalities due to aspiration of barium exist in the literature. From the forensic and radiological point of view no concrete clues for medical malpractice in the course of this complication associated with a barium swallow could be found.
