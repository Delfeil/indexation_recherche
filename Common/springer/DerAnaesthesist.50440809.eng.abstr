The routine use of succinylcholine for endotracheal intubation is being increasingly questioned. Initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions. However, most of these initial studies either did not have a double-blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants. In this study, intubation conditions using fentanyl/propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl/propofol/succinylcholine and sodium thiopental/succinylcholine.
