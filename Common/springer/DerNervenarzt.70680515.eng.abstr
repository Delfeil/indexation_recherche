Ganglionic and synovial cysts (juxta-facet cysts) causing nerve root compression are very rare. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best means of diagnosis. The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the cysts, though spontaneous remissions do occur. CT-guided aspiration of the cysts and corticosteroid injection can lead the symptoms to disappear, but only for a short time. In a retrospective study covering a period of 16.5 years, we discovered 24 juxta-facet cysts (10 ganglionic and 14 synovial cysts) with clinical symptoms in a total of 19,107 lumbar and thoracic operations performed to relieve nerve root compression: 16 cysts were located at the level L4-5, 3 at the level L5-S1, 2 at L3-4, and 1 each at the levels L2-3, L1-2, and T10-1. Seven patients complained of radicular pain, and the other 17 patients also had neurological deficits. Fourteen cysts were resected, and in 10 cases the lumbar disc was removed simultaneously. The average follow-up in 23 of the 24 patients was 26.6 months. Most (74%) of the patients became free of pain. Pareses disappeared in 89% and sensory deficits in 73% of cases.
