An infant girl presented at birth with multiple, large nodular xanthogranulomas. Her monozygotic twin sister was not affected. The congenital tumors were up to 1.5 cm in diameter, done-shaped and mainly located on the head and the upper half of the body. Histologically the cells were characterized as CD68+ non-Langerhans histiocytes. Follow-up for 18 months showed no new tumors and regression of the existing ones. No extracutaneous manifestations were observed. Knowledge of the differential diagnosis, especially the group of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, is essential for prognosis estimation.
