 From 1992 to 1994 a total of 224 patients were retrospectively analyzed with respect to peripheral nervous lesions after carotid desobliteration. Besides a stroke rate of 1.3% and a mortality of 0.9%, 19 patients (8.5%) with nervous lesions were identified. Only branches from cerebral nerves and the cervical plexus were affected, being in close topographic relationship to the operative region. Of these lesions 47.4% were completely and three lesions partially reversible. Additionally, five patients who had suffered transient ischemic attack were examined; one patient presented with postoperative convulsions and one with a hemineglect following hemodynamic infarction. The clinical presentations of the nervous lesions are discussed with regard to their anatomic topography in the operation area.
