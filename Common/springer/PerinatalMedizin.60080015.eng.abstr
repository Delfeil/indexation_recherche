 From 1983 through 1992 the yearly rate of newborn infants with a birthweight below 2500 g in the Federal Republic of Germany was nearly constant at 5.8%. In 1992 the perinatal mortality in these patients was 5.8%, with an overall perinatal mortality of 0.58%. During the past 10 years there was a constant decline in perinatal mortality in the birthweight-specific subgroups when the extremely low birthweight infants (below 500 g) were excluded; in these no clear tendency was apparent during the observation period. In 1992 the rate of perinatal mortality in these infants was 91.2%. The perinatal mortality of all liveborns with birthweights between 500 g and 1500 g decreased from 26.5% in 1983 to 13.3% in 1992. Roughly 20% of these patients had died within their first year of life in 1992.
