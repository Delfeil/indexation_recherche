 This study considers findings of psychological gerontology as particularly important for geriatric rehabilitation research. Its concrete aim was to describe the course and outcome of geriatric rehabilitation based on a wide range of success criteria, to explore the influencing role of age, sex, and diagnosis as well as to describe the variability pattern of success. The data were gathered from a sample of 100 older adults who underwent treatment in a German inpatient rehabilitation unit. Participants were assessed across five measurement occasions by use of a state-of-the-art geriatric assessment and psychological data collection part. The results underline, for one, that significant improvements of functional as well as psychological capacity were obtained. Second, age and sex played practically no role concerning the course of the success criteria, whereas diagnosis revealed some statistically meaningful effects. Third, it was found that the variability of success was characterized by a relatively homogenous pattern of gain with regard to functional criteria; with respect to psychological variables, heterogeneity was more pronounced and some participants show loss as well, a chance for further improvement of the geriatric rehabilitation.
