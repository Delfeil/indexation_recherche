 In order to describe the wounding capacity in standardized manner, gelatine was used to simulate biological targets in terminal ballistics. The aim was the investigation of blank cartridges with wound ballistic methods. Blank cartridges (caliber 9 mm x 17) produced by RWS, SM, Wadie and Umarex were fired with starter's revolvers of .380 caliber into 10% gelatine blocks. Shots were fired at 4  °C at distances ranging from close contact and from 1 up to 50 cm distance. The blocks of gelatine and their cross-sections were photographed using slide film which was digitized and analyzed by computer. Contact shots produced penetration from 21 to 63 mm in depth and the maximum diameter of the wound cavity measured from 7 to 42 mm. Up to a distance of 4 cm black powder blank cartridges produced tearing of more than 1 cm depth. Shots from a distance of 10 cm propelled many particles up to 13 mm deep into the gelatine. At a shooting range of 50 cm 13% of the particles penetrated deeper than 3 mm and some penetrated up to 7 mm. The experimental findings give evidence of the well known risk of fatal injury from contact shots. Up to a shooting range of 5 cm injuries of the eye bulb are to be expected and at a 50 cm distance severe lesions of the cornea.
