 Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed countries. Thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery has been shown to cause acute myocardial infarction in over 90% of the cases. Early and complete restoration of bloodflow in the infarct-related coronary artery is the principal mechanism by which reperfusion therapy improves outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to reduce mortality when given early after symptom onset. However, even the most effective, approved thrombolytic regimens achieve normal (so-called TIMI 3) flow in the infarct vessel at 60-90 minutes only in about half of the patients and reocclusion occurrs in 5-10%. Bleeding events, especially intracranial bleedings, observed in up to 1% of the patients, are the most severe complication of thrombolysis. Primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is associated with somewhat higher patency rates and significantly fewer strokes than thrombolysis, but confers a reocclusion rate of about 5-10% and it is not universally available. While smaller randomized studies suggested a significant advantage of PTCA over thrombolysis, these results could not be confirmed in the larger GUSTO IIb angioplasty study in over 1000 patients and in non-randomized comparisons in large registries. Therefore, a general mortality advantage of PTCA over thrombolysis could not be demonstrated. Primary PTCA should be preferred in patients with contraindications against thrombolysis, patients with a high risk for intracranial bleedings (age > 75 and high blood pressure on admission) and hemodynamically unstable patients.
