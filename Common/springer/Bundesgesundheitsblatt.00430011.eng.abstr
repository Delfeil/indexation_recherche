The laboratory surveillance of measles in Germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation. Compared to data of the pre-vaccination era, the incidence of measles has been reduced, while a shift in age towards the group of 15-year-olds is observed. Germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of eradicating measles in the European region by the year 2007. Apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking, the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot. In order to effectively control measles, high vaccination rates of at least 90% are necessary by the end of the second year of life. In addition, laboratory surveillance has to be included to measure successful vaccination. Main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases, seroprevalence studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses. The Working Group Measles ("Arbeitsgemeinschaft Masern" - AGM) as well as the amended law on infection prevention are important instruments to make measurable progress towards measles eradication also in Germany. We report on the activities of the National Reference Centre for Measles, Mumps and Rubella since 1991. The German data are compared to those of selected other European countries.
