The situation of women in dermatology was evaluated with the aid of questionnaires in spring 1994. A questionnaire was sent to 33 clinics in Germany and 46 in other European countries, asking about the proportions of male and female physicians in each department. In addition, individual department members were asked in another questionnaire about their reasons for choosing dermatology and about possible sex discrimination. The clinic questionnaires were returned from 22 German and 37 other European clinics and the individual questionnaires by 548 German physicians and 1164 physicians from the other countries (overall 52% women). We found that 41.8% of the dermatologists in German clinics were women, as against 43.4% in the other countries. Women made up about half of the fully qualified specialists, but accounted for only a small percentage of those in higher positions (10.8% in Germany, 27.9% in other countries). Of the 1712 physicians who answered the individual questionnaire, the majority had chosen dermatology because of their interest in the specialty. Slightly more women than men gave other reasons, such as more free time - mostly for family matters - or less physical strain. Clearly more women than men felt they were discriminated against professionally because of their sex. The reasons for this related primarily to the biological and social role of women in society. Overall, women are thus well represented in our specialty, except in leading positions.
