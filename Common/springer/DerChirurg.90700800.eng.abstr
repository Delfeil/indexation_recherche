 The diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen is a rare splenic proliferation. Spontaneous rupture is the main, potentially lethal complication, found in 25 % of cases. The problem with these vascular tumors is preoperative diagnosis, because they are asymptomatic for a long time. First-choice therapy is limited resection. In the case of rupture, splenectomy is a life-saving procedure. We report on a 56-year-old woman with a spontaneous splenic rupture as the first symptom of diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen. Exceptional features of splenic hemangiomas, causes of spontaneous rupture and the therapy are described.
