 Malignant tumors of the hepatobiliopancreatic system are not curable in > 60 %. For this reason, palliation plays an important therapeutic role. Indications are mainly obstructive jaundice, duodenal obstruction and pain. Assessment of the tumor's morphology and resectability is often possible only by surgical exploration. If necessary and feasible, non-curable malignancies are treated synchronously during this operation. In preoperatively proven distant metastases or local non-resectability, interventional procedures are preferred. They are efficient, at least primarily, and mostly correlated with little patient discomfort. A surgical biliary bypass obviously leads to improved long-term palliation. Especially in Klatskin tumors, palliative resection may be useful. Generally the patients benefit from palliation depends on minor therapeutic discomfort and long-lasting control of symptoms.
