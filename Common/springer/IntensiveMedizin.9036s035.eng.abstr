 Controlled mechanical hypoventilation with reduced tidal volumes and peak inspiratory pressures has been introduced into the treatment of ARDS in order to avoid pulmonary hyperinflation and ventilator-induced lung injury. The concomitant increase of arterial PCO2 has been denoted as permissive hypercapnia. Recent clinical studies suggest a potential benefit of this concept for patients with acute respiratory failure, although several organ systems can be affected by the increase of PaCO2.
