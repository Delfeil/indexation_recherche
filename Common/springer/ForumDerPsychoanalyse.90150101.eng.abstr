The paper deals with the question of how the biological difference in gender influences the psycho-sexual development: It manifests itself in different positions towards the primary object (mother) and towards the secondary object (father), and this means that some development crisis appear at different times for girls than for boys: Early oedipus complex (which is also referred to as separation crisis) - mature oedipus complex (getting unambiguity of the sexual identification) - puberty (establishment of genitality) - adolescence (search for the love object outside of the family). Today the solution of the mature oedipus complex for the girl (that Freud doubted) has become possible and the inequality between the sexes that had been produced by society according to the example of the mother-child couple has been partially levelled. The adolescent moratorium is open to both sexes, and sexuality, love and generativity, that the sexes produce together, have been democratized in the course of the cultural change.
