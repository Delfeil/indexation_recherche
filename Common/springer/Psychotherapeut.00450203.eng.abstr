A major proportion of out-patient psychotherapy is of short duration. Yet recently developed psychodynamic short-term psychotherapies have still not found adequate reception in training and practice. We give an overview of the development from drive-oriented to interpersonal and eclectic approaches. Special requirements of technique are presented, with regard to limited time and goals, the necessities for the therapist to become more active, and to formulate and to maintain a focus from the beginning of the treatment. Controversies regarding managing transference and resistance are discussed in the light of research findings. Good and lasting effects of the increasingly manualized treatments are well-established for less severe (e.g. adjustment) disorders. With the widening scope of treatment adherence to rigid and narrow time limits is not always feasible and technical adjustments become necessary. There is still a need for research on the indication for short-term psychotherapy, its place in the treatment career, and on efficacious models for training therapists.
