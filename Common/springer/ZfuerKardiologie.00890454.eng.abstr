 We investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet (diet I) adapted to nutritional habits in Germany. Data were compared to a low fat diet (diet II) according to the American Heart Association. The study was performed in 37 patients with coronary heart disease (30 males and 7 females, age 45-83 yrs) stratified to the 2 dietary treatments. Daily fat intake was 38g (24% of energy intake of 6.5MJ/d) in diet I and 60g (31% of 7.3MJ/d) in diet II (p<0.01), respectively. When compared with dietII, in dietI the intake of cholesterol, saturated and monunsaturated fatty acids, Vit. A, Vit. D and Vit. B12 were all reduced (p<0.01), whereas the uptake of Vit. C was increased p<0.01. The intake of folic acid was low in both groups. Both diets resulted in a decrease in BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. Concomitantly plasma triglycerides only decreased in response to dietI but HDL cholesterol levels remained unchanged. Reduction of BMI and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline BMI and cholesterol concentrations, respectively. The cholesterol lowering effect of diet I is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet. Taking into account the nutritional habits in Germany, very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value. Both diets are effective in lowering body weight, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels without affecting HDL cholesterol. These effects are most pronounced in overweight and hypercholesterolemic patients.
