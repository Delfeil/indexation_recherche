Fucosidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease due to nearly complete deficiency of -L- fucosidase, was diagnosed in two unrelated male German patients who exhibited typical symptoms of this disorder including mental retardation, dysostosis multiplex, vacuolization of lymphocytes and progressive neurologic deterioration by the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively. In both cases, activity of -L-fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible. DNA analysis revealed a nonsense mutation (G401X) in exon 7 of the fucosidase gene; this leads to a premature stop codon and C-terminal deletion of 61 amino acids from the protein. Discussion: On account of the mutation a unique PFlMI restriction site is obliterated; this simplifies molecular diagnosis of the G401X mutation. So far, the mutation G401X has not been found in any other population.
