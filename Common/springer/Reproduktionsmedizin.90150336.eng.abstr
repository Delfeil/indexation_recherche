Legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Germany. This article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against PGD. In the autor's view neither the fact that PGD is not a well established technique nor the danger that single-cell-analysis may lead to misdiagnosis convincingly demonstrates that PGD is morally inacceptable. Inconsistencies in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept PGD are highlighted. The use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing PGD is criticised. Extensive counselling prior to PGD should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision.
