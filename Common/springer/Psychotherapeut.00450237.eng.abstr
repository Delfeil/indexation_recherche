As a part of a project for "Practical studies about long-term psychoanalytic therapies" an instrument was developed of the Heidelberg Group for measuring the stages of re-structuring of the patient's personality in the course of analytic therapies. The instrument relies in its formal structure on the APES-Scale of Stiles (1992). In our scale, however, the stages of development not to the general requirement of problems, but rather to an specific model of the psychoanalytic process. The scale and the included model are presented and theoretically founded. Furthermore, results of the reliability and first experiences with application in in-patient therapies are described. It should be emphasized that our scale is not only an instrument of research, but also a of practice for planing and evaluating of psychodynamic treatments and therefore a contribution to quality assurance in this field.
