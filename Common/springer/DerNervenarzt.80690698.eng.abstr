We present the case report of a young wo- man who suffered from schizophrenialike psychosis leading to polydipsia and consequent water intoxication. Because of progressive somnolence and epileptic seizures therapy on the intensive care unit became necessary. Findings of MRI and cerebrospinal fluid were consistent with the diagnosis of chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. As other possible causes could be excluded, multiple sclerosis seemed to be most probable. Simultaneous incidence of schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis and the differential diagnosis of central pontine myelinolysis following hyponatremia are discussed.
