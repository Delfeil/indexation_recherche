  The incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) shows large regional differences. This variability cannot be completely explained by differences in classical risk factors. 28-day case fatality of AMI remains unacceptably high with 50% on the average, although therapeutic possibilities have improved considerably. Time trends in mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) show a decrease in most Western European countries and an increase in Eastern Europe. On a population level, the impact of medical care on the short-term and long-term prognosis of AMI is not completely understood. Despite considerable progress in primary and secondary prevention, the incidence and prevalence of IHD will increase in the future due to aging of the population.
