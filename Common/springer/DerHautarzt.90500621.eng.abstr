Different pest arthropods and dermatophytes occurring primarily in farm animals may be transmissible to man and produce human dermatoses. The movement and cutaneous penetration habits of external parasites often cause crusted papules, severe itching and dermatitis or may damage their hosts by blood-sucking or by sensitizing them to their saliva. Furthermore different dermatophytes should be considered a possible cause of human skin lesions. Farm animals (cattle, pig, poultry, and rabbit) can transmit external parasites (ticks: Ixodes ricinus, Argas reflexus; fleas: Ceratophyllus gallinae, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, and mites: Sarcoptes scabiei var. bovis, Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis, Dermanyssus gallinae, Cheyletiella parasitovorax), and dermatophytes (Trichophyton sp., and Microsporum sp.). People who have close contact to infested farm animals are more often exposed to epizoonotic infections. Certain professions, such as farmers, and veterinarians, are especially vulnerable.
