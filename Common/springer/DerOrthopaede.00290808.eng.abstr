Patients with spastic cerebral palsy often develop torsional deformities at the level of hip, shank or foot. The abnormal muscle activity such as spasticity or the increase of tone are considered as the major cause. The present study shows that the gait pattern is another cause which may lead to deformities. The study is based on gait analysis of 13 patients and 8 normal controls. The major and significant differences in gait kinematics were toe walking, toeing-in and internal rotation at the hip in the patients whereas the unaffected control group had a physiological heel-toe gait.
