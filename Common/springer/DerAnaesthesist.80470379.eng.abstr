Objective: Anaesthetic agents are believed to have an adverse effect on human immune defense mechanisms. We investigated changes in peripheral immune cell numbers such as natural killer (NK) cells, B cells and T lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4+ and CD8+ cells) and differences in cytokine production after stimulation with different mitogens before and during narcosis.
