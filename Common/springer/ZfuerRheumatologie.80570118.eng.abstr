 A 57-years old female patient with systemic sclerosis underwent a prolonged intravenous therapy during 21 consecutive days with iloprost, a stable analogue of prostacyclin. Beginning with 0,5 ng/kg/minute the dose was increased every 2 days up to 2 ng/kg/minute. At the end of follow up, Iloprost was shown to enhance the perfusion of the finger and to improve pulmonary-function tests including the diffusion-capacity. Furthermore, the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate and the C-reactive protein decreased.
