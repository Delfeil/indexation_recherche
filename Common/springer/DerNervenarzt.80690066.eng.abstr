Approximately 60% of patients with major depression disorder show a beneficial response to total sleep deprivation (TSD), but the positive effect of TSD is short, and naps or the following night's sleep destroy it. Various methods have been tried to stabilize the positive sleep-deprivation effect. A consecutive 1-week advance in the sleep phase stabilized mood in more than 50% of the sleep-deprivation responders. We examined 40 male patients with major depression who in addition to medical treatment took part in a phase advance study to prove possible synergistic effects. About 60% of the patients showed positive mood stabilization after 1-week of treatment when the patients were sleep-deprivation responders. These results support data from other groups.
