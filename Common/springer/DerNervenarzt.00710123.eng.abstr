Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP), i. e., unawareness of motor deficits and associated disorders, has been frequently reported, predominantly following right hemispheric lesions. To a smaller extent, there are case reports of patients who give accounts of a feeling of strangeness concerning the contralesional limbs and sometimes attribute them to other persons. This "positive-variant" of AHP has been labeled "somatoparaphrenia" (SP).
