Purpose: Three-dimensional realisation of CT by models produced by a milling machine and stereolithography has become a useful procedure for the diagnosis of craniomaxillofacial disharmonies. We used three-dimensional milling models to verify the results of operations involving sagittal splitting of the mandible. Material and methods: Fifteen models from patients with mandibular prognathism and 31 models from patients with mandibular retrognathism, made preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively, were examined for three-dimensional changes of the osseous anatomical structures. Results: The mandibular corpus had been shifted between 1 and 3 mm forward in the group of patients with mandibular retrognathism and by the same distance backward in the first group. In the group with ventral shifting, the intercondylar distance increased by 2.9 mm, while it decreased by 1.9 mm in patients with the mandibular backshift operation. Furthermore, the distance between the muscular processes increased by 6.6 mm in the first group and decreased by 1.6 mm in the second. The Bonewill angle decreased by 1.6 ° in patients after ventral shifting and increased by 1.7 ° in the dorsally shifted group. Contrary changes in the left and right gonion angle were seen: if the right decreased, the left increased. The same situation was found in both groups. Conclusion: We noted remarkable changes in the condylar position and anatomy after sagittal splitting of the mandible.
