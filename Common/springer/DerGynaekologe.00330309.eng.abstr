Non-palpable breast-lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis. Accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since freehand positionin of al localization wire is often suboptimal. The consequences are larger tissue-defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result. Nevertheless, resection of microcalcifications by conventional surgery remains sometimes incomplete. Digital mammography coupled with stereotactic biopsy procedures gives more accurate results with minimal invasive techniques. The advantages and disadvantages of the advanced breast biopsy intstrumentation (ABBI) procedure versus vacuum biopsy systems are summarized and compared. Either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the methods.
