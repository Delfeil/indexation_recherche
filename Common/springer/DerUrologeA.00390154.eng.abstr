186 cases of nephrectomy for renal cell cancer are studied retrospectively. The overall 5-year survival rate was 77,2 %. According to the 4th edition of the "TNM" classification system of UICC the survival rates of patients with T2- (n = 97), T3 a (n = 58) and T3b-tumors (n = 25) were 80,9 %, 79,3 % and 65,6 %, respectively. No patient with a stage T4 tumor (n = 6) survived longer than 20 months. The 5-year survival rate of patients with N1-lymph node metastases was 83,3 % (n = 8); without lymph node metastases 78,3 % (n = 152), respectively. There was no survival longer than 20 months in case of N2-lymph node metastases (n = 13). According to the grading survival rates of 95,4 % (G1, n = 46), 71,2 % (G2, n = 130) and 71,4 % (G3, n = 8) resulted.
