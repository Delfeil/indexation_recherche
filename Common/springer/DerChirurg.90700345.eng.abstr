 Numerous inherited genetic changes predisposing to cancer have already been identified and the number is increasing. Accurate prediction of individual risk by means of molecular diagnosis implies clinical consequences in the treatment of cancer-predisposing syndromes. Using familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) as an example, we present here the underlying genetic changes that contribute to tumor development. These genetic alterations can be efficiently identified through molecular diagnostic techniques. Identification of the familial germline mutation permits one to distinguish mutation carriers from non-mutation carriers within affected families and results in individually tailored surveillance and prevention. Therefore, molecular diagnosis is making a contribution to the advances in preventive surgical therapy. The indications are discussed.
