 The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a hormone-dependent transcription factor that modulates gene transcription by binding to its response element, interacting with other transcription factors, contacting the basal transcription machinery and by interacting with several intermediary proteins, such as coactivators. Here we duscuss the most prominent examples for interacting proteins that belong to the basal transcription apparatus and intermediary factors. Furthermore, we describe a new class of GR-interacting proteins (GRIPs) which have been identified by a blotting technique, using a radioactively labeled GR/GRE complex as a probe to identify proteins that interact with the activated GR.
