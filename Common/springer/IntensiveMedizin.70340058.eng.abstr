 The aim of thrombolysis is reperfusion of an occluded vessel by thrombolytic agents. In acute myocardial infarction thrombolysis has been shown to achieve an early recanalization of an occluded vessel in a high percentage of patients and to reduce mortality significantly. Also, in severe pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic compromise thrombolysis has been shown to stabilize cardiac function and is assumed to reduce mortality. In contrast to thrombolytic therapy, in life-threatening situations such as acute myocardial infarction or severe pulmonary embolism, thrombolysis is regarded as an elective therapy in addition to systemic heparinization in deep venous thrombosis. Whether or not the aim of thrombolysis in deep venous thrombosis - to prevent a postthrombotic syndrome - can be achieved is not proven. Large prospective or randomized studies are still missing. A concomitant anticoagulation or the use of platelet aggregation inhibitors is necessary.
