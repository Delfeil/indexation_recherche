This paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose. We then introduce its objectives, the members of the study group, the composition of the collective and selection of cases, and the methods used for ascertainment and recording of data. Results are then presented with reference to the various hypotheses put forward.
