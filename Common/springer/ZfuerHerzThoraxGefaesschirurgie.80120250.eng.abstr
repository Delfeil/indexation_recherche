  The typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after strenous exercise. Ocular muscle involvement with ptosis (in 50%) and diplopia (in 25%) are the most common initial signs. The disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles (generalized myasthenia). The muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can mislead to a diagnosis of neurasthenia. Since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease. Also, a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy. The mainstay of the diagnosis is the history and a subtle clinical examination with tests of excessive muscle fatiguability. The injection of edrophonium (Tensilon), the electrodiagnostic testing after repitive stimulation (decrement test) and the testing for serum antibodies against acetylcholin receptors have to be performed to secure the diagnosis of myasthenia. The edrophonium test and the decrement test can yield false positive results in other neuromuscular diseases. Antibodies are present in 50% of ocular myasthenia and in 80-90% of the generalized form. The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, other neuromuscular diseases, mitochondrial diseases, diseases of the cranial nerves, botulism and the rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have to be considered as differential diagnosis.
