A study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery. A total of 1103 impacted lower wisdom teeth and 3 impacted lower second molars were removed in 687 patients, all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively. Clinical, radiological, and surgical factors of each case were recorded. Postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination. Follow-up was carried out for a maximum of 35 weeks. Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve occurred with an incidence of 3.57%. The lingual nerve was injured in 2.1% of patients. Most of the initially reported alterations in sensation resolved within the follow-up period. Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0.91%, and of the lingual nerve in 0.37%. However, the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general. The effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed. For the inferior alveolar nerve, analysis revealed significant effects in older patients, for completely developed roots, for deeply impacted teeth, in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal, for difficult surgery, and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve. The surgeon and the anesthesia had a significant influence on lingual dysesthesia.
