Somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy has been in clinical use for several years. Most of the experience with somatostatin tumor scintigraphy has been obtained with gastro-enteropathic (GEP) tumors and carcinoids. Clinical applications of somatostatin imaging have been reported in small-cell lung carcinomas, malignant lymphomas, renal-cell carcinomas, breast cancers and medullary thyroid cancers. Somatostatin analogues were initially applicable in larger medical institutions because of the necessity for radioactive labeling with iodine (octreotide to [123I-Tyr3]-octreotide); however, the clinical results with iodinated analogues were worse than the relatively new analogue [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]octreotide, now available as Octreoscan. This review describes the current status of the clinical application of somatostatin receptor imaging, together with our own experience in carcinoids, GEP tumors and medullary thyroid carcinomas.
