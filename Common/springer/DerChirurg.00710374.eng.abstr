Abstract.  Viral hepatitis is one of the most important infectious diseases worldwide. It is frequent in tropical and subtropical areas, but also plays still a significant role in the industrialized countries of Northern and Western Europe and the USA. In Germany more than 100 000 people are infected by viral hepatitis each year. Whereas hepatitis A and E are transmitted fecal-orally, hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted by the parenteral route. Most hepatitis A infections seen in Germany are acquired abroad. Hepatitis B is still a nosocomial disease; the majority of infections in Germany, however, seems to be transmitted sexually. For the serological diagnosis of viral hepatitis a battery of sensitive tests for specific antibodies and antigens is available; usually testing of one serum sample allows an unambiguous diagnosis. Prophylaxis of hepatitis A and B is possible using safe and efficient vaccines.
