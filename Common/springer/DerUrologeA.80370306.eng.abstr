The excact pathogenesis of Peyronie's Disease (PD) is still unknown. Histopathological investigations suggest, that the metabolism of the collogenious tissue plays an important role. Therefore, we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of 11 patients with PD and 11 healthy controls. We mesured biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood, wich correspond to the collagen metabolism (procollagen III [P III P], PMN-elastase [PMN-E], fibronectin [FN], fibronectinreceptor [FN-R] und -1-proteinase-inhibitor [-1-PI]). There was no difference in PMN-E, P III P, FN and FN-R in all samples. There was no difference in penile and venous blood as well. But we found out a highly significant lower concentration of -1-PI in patients with PD (158,55 mg/dl) than in controls (214,82 mg/dl).
