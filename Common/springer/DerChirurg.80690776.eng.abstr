Aim: As an alternative method to the operative revision of benign bile duct strictures, we report the use of a large-bore bile duct prosthesis (Yamakawa prosthesis) in one patient. Methods: Bilateral percutaneous transhepatic implantation of Yamakawa prostheses (14 F right side, 12 F left side) was performed without adjunctive balloon dilatation. The prostheses were exchanged every 8 weeks under continuous antibiotic treatment and were finally removed after 8 months. Results: Control cholangiography showed a normal intrahepatic biliary system on the right side and a 50 % stenosis at the orifice of the left hepatic duct. Follow-up over 18 months showed no signs of recurrent disease. Conclusions: In comparison to balloon dilatation and implantation of metallic stents, prolonged bilateral splinting with large-bore Yamakawa prostheses seems to be an alternative for the treatment of benign bile duct strictures.
