We report the case of a 35-year-old male who was admitted to the intensive care unit because of somnolence due to accidental hypothermia. Initial examination showed a Glasgow coma score of 10 and a rectal temperature of 27.4 ° C. Because of stable circulatory conditions, there was no mandatory indication for rewarming by means of cardiopulmonary bypass. We rewarmed the patient with an extracorporeal veno-venous haemofiltration device combined with a countercurrent fluid warmer. An average increase in body temperature of 1.34 ° Ch-1 could be obtained. We conclude that the described technique represents an effective and well-controllable method for treatment of hypothermia in patients with stable haemodynamic conditions. Because of the availability of the required equipment, this method can also be practised in hospitals without cardiac surgical departments and cardiopulmonary bypass facilities.
