Variations of the clinical course of the internal carotid artery are reported with an incidence of 15-40% in the literature. They mainly arise from degenerative lesions leading to elongation, slight coiling, and kinking of the vessel. Besides that, a sigmoid tortuosity represents an occasional congenital anomaly. This article reports two cases of tortuosity of the internal carotid artery which resulted in impressions of the pharyngeal wall and minor globus syndromes. The possibility of false diagnoses is demonstrated. The etiology and clinical significance of these variations are discussed in detail.
