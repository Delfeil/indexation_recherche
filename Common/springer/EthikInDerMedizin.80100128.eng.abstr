Abstract.  Definition of the problem: The development of molecular genetics has provided tools not only for the diagnosis of genetic diseases and disease dispositions in affected individuals, but also for the detection of healthy carriers of recessive hereditary traits. The resulting, ethically controversial option of genetic population screening used to be restricted to a small number of rather rare diseases by methodological limitations which are now about to be overcome.
