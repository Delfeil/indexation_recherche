Although individual extrapyramidal symptoms as a consequence of carbon monoxide intoxication have frequently been reported, typical (complete) Parkinson's syndrome has very rarely been documented. This report presents for the first time a case of acute Parkinson's syndrome with delayed manifestation after the initially occurring organic psychosis. A 53-year-old man with a long history of schizoaffective psychosis first developed a severe acute organic psychosis with disturbances of orientation and marked amnestic disturbances after carbon monoxide intoxication as a result of a suicide attempt. On the 21st day after intoxication, acute Parkinson's syndrome with right accentuation was recorded, with CCT identification of lesions on both sides of the basal ganglia area. Full remission of the Parkinson's syndrome was achieved with rheological treatment and l-dopa therapy.
