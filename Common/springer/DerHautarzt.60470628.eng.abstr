Atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases, with a still increasing incidence. Although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood, a variety of triggering factors are known.

This demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be.
