Since 1993 almost 400 patients with port wine stains have been treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser. The therapeutic effect on 61 adult patients was evaluated. After a mean of 2.16 treatments the colour lightened by between 33% and 100% in 70% of these patients. The best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains. In this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful. The rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5%. The results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions. The flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains.
