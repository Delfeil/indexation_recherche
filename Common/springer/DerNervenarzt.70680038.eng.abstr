Psychopathological and neurological adverse drug reactions (ADR) have been repeatedly reported during treatment with gyrase inhibitors (fluorquinolones). Results of earlier studies indicated a high risk for ADR especially in the elderly with high dosage medication, psychiatric history and renal dysfunction. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of adverse CNS effects are not completely understood. GABA-ergic and monoaminergic mechanisms might play a major part.
