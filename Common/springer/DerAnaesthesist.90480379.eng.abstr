Objective: The aim of the present study was to show the influence of the parameters of gas exchange (arterial oxygen pressure paO2, arterial oxygen saturation SatO2) and haemodynamics (arterial systolic and mean blood pressure RRs and MAP) on the restitution of cognitive functions in geriatric patients scheduled for elective hip arthroplasty.
