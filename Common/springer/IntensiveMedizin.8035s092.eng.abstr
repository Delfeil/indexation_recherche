  As a result of theoretical considerations, experimental results, and clinical experiences concerning an optimal or critical hemoglobin concentration of a patient in the intensive care unit, an optimal value of 10 +/- 2 g/dl is derived, which as a result of hemodilution of any cause needs no correction by hemotherapy. A transfusion of erythrocytes in the hemoglobin concentration range of 7 to 10 g/dl is accepted only when reasons are given, i.e., transfusion is only accepted for a patient with signs of general or local hypoxia. These data are valid for a patient under normoxia, normovolemia, and normothermia.
