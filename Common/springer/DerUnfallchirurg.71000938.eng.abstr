The aim of this study was to evaluate the results after open Bankart repair using suture anchors in patients with recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability. Some 32 patients were prospectively observed for a mean of 40 months (24-60) after stabilization. The mean age at the time of operation was 29.7 years. All patients were postoperatively immobilized in a sling for 3 weeks. According to the criteria of Rowe, 29 patients (90.6 %) had good or excellent results. Two patients (6.3 %) developed recurrent instability 6-24 months postoperatively; 93.7 % were not or only slights limited in sports activities. Bankart repair is an excellent treatment for recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability. The use of suture anchors is an appropriate way of reattaching the capsuloligamentous complex to the glenoid to restore stability to an unstable joint.
