Twenty-nine patients (26 male and 3 female) with habitual or obstructive snoring and socially disturbing character were followed over a ten week period. All patients were treated with radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (RFVTR) of the soft palate. In 21 patients this operation was combined with other surgery of the upper airway, eight patients had soft palate reduction with RFVTR exclusively. With this method an electrode is positioned in the musculatur of the soft palate submucosaly. RFVTR may be performed under local anesthesia and has to be repeated if necessary. Ten weeks postoperatively 24 of 29 patients, respectively their social-partners, reported subjective reduction of snoring after the first treatment. Markable improvement of snoring was seen in 20 of 29 patients postoperatively and reduction of the respiratory-disturbance-index (RDI) for more than 10 was noticed in 7/29 patients polysomnographically. 5/8 patients who were treated with RFVTR exclusively, showed reduction of snoring and 3/8 patients had RDI-reduction for more than 10. We conclude, that RFVTR of the soft palate is sucessful in the treatment of snoring and may be helpful in the treatment of mild obstructive-sleep-apnea-syndrome (OSAS).
