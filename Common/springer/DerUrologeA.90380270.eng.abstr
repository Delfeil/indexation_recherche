The intramuscular (i. m.) administration of Decapeptyl Depot has been approved in Germany for the treatment of advanced hormone dependent prostate cancer since July 1990. In this study a reformulated Decapeptyl Depot, administered as a first-line endocrine therapy, was injected intramuscularly (i. m.) or subcutaneously (s. c.) every 28 days for 6 months. At 12 different hospitals, 52 prostate cancer patients were treated, whereby 25 patients received a s. c. injection and 27 patients a i. m. injection. Testosterone was measured as the main parameter: after 28 days, both the s. c. and the i. m. application form of Decapeptyl Depot successfully reduced initial testosterone levels of at least 2.3 ng/ml to steady-state castration levels below 1.2 ng/ml, maintaining this complete suppression for the entire length of the trial (168 days). Decapeptyl Depot was well tolerated and very acceptable to the patients in both groups. Side effects were few and predictable, being largely associated with decreased testosterone concentrations. No cumulation in triptorelin serum levels was observed within the 6 months of treatment. Decapeptyl Depot, administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly was effective and safe in the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer.
