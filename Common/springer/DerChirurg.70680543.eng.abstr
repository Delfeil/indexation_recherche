The therapy for spontaneous or artificial perforation of the esophagus remains a controversial matter. The following case report deals with the medical history of an artificial esophageal perforation after operative treatment of cervical disc disease. A 68-year-old male patient underwent a C4/C5 and C5/C6 discectomy with interbody fusion of C7-T1 vertebral body, according to Smith-Robinson. During this operation, a 3-cm-long lesion was made in the posterior wall of the esophagus, which was treated 24 h later with a primary suture. The clinical follow-up was complicated by mediastinitis with subsequent multiorgan failure. After recovery from this critical condition the patient complained of severe dysphagia, which was related to a persistent lesion in the posterior esophageal wall with endoscopically demonstrated dislocation of a screw. After removal of the screw, the lesion was covered by means of sternocleidomastoid myoplasty. Moderate postoperative dysphagia was successfully treated by bougienage.
