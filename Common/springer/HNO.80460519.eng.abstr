Elevation of nasal resistance has been described as an effect of increased air temperature by different authors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of high environmental temperature on congestion of the nasal mucosa. In all, 102 volunteers were studied and included normal controls, heart rehabilitation patients and high performance sportsmen. Rhinomanometric examinations were carried out before and after 10 min in a dry Finnish sauna at a 90 °C temperature. Computerized active anterior rhinomanometry was used. A uniform response pattern to the increased temperature could not be observed: i.e., some individuals had an elevated resistance immediately after the sauna while resistance was decreased in others. The relationship between the reaction of the nasal mucosa to body work and temperature is discussed.
