VVS represents the standard procedure of choice for the treatment of obstructive azoospermia following vasectomy. However, recently ICSI has been suggested by some to represent the solution for all cases of male factor infertility regardless of its etiology based on its success rates. Therefore, we compared VVS to MESA/TESE and ICSI in terms of pregnancy, complications, and costs. Between 1/93 and 6/98 157 VVS was performed microsurgically using the 2-layer technique in 157 patients following prior vasectomy. Between 9/94 and 9/97 69 couples underwent MESA/ICSI for epididymal obstruction not amenable to microsurgical reconstruction such as postinflammatory obstruction and congenital absence of the vas deferens; in the same time period 42 couples underwent TESE/ICSI for azoospermia of testicular origin due to cryptorchidism, testicular atrophy, obstruction of the rete testis. In most ases MESA or TESE and ICSI were performed metachronously. Mean interval of vasal obstruction was 7.6 (0.5-18) years; patency after VVS was 77%, pregnancy rate was 52%. Local complication rate was 4.7%, no maior complications were observed. Costs per life birth after VVS were as high as 5.447,- DM or 2.800 Euro. Pregnancy rates after MESA/TESE and ICSI were 22.5% and 19.5%, respectively with 16 singletons, 3 twins and 3 abortions; local complications occured in 3.9% of the men. Multiple birth were noticed in 15.8% following ICSI, but only in 0.7% following VVS. 5.7% and 1.4% of the femal partners experienced serious complications as a mild or severe ovarian hyperstimulation-syndrome, respectively. Costs per life birth after MESA/TESE cycle were as high as 28.804,- DM or 14.100 Euro. Even in the era of ICSI microsurgical vasovasostomy represents the standard approach for obstructive azoospermia following vasectomy. Based on a cost-benefit analysis VVS is more successful in terms of pregnancy rates (52% vs. 22.5%). We conclude that MESA/ICSI should be reserved for patients not amenable for microsurgical reconstruction.
