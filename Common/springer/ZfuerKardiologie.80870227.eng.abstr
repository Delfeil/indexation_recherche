  Prerequisite for successful radiofrequency catheter ablation of tachycardias is the exact mapping during the electrphysiologic study. The new mapping system CARTO allows a three-dimensional color-coded electroanatomic map of impulse propagation using electromagnetic technology. Mapping of sinuatrial activation in the right atrium of 11 patients represents the first clinical experience with this new system. The physiological activation sequence could be determined in all patients three-dimensionally, and the sinus node could be localized as a physiological activation focus with interindividual variability only in the sagital plane without complications. The nonfluoroscopic mapping system allows high resolution visualization of electrical activity and may therefore improve precision and simplify the determination of the arrhythmogenic substrate during tachycardias for successful catheter ablation.
