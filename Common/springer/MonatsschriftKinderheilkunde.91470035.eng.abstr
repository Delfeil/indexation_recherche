Case: A newborn infant was treated in hospital because of suspected pneumonia and renal insufficiency at the third day post partum. Seven days later, shortly after having been nursed by her mother, the newborn vomited an eucalyptus oil-smelling liquid, which was collected in a diaper. This liquid and the liquid obtained from a gastrolavage performed immediately afterwards were secured in air-tight bottles. The family of the newborn laid a charge against the hospital for bodily harm caused by negligence reproaching the hospital for having wilfully given the newborn a toxic substance.
