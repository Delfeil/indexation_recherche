Core decompression of the necrotic area for treatment of idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head was developed and published by Ficat and Arlet in 1962 within the scope of their "Functional exploration of bone". The mode of action is attributed to a reduction of the intramedullary pressure in the bony compartment of the femoral head. The possibilities of repair and bone regeneration following core decompression are still discussed controversially. Core decompression is a common but not generally accepted procedure in the treatment of idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head. After first publications of positive mid- and long-term effects, some subsequent studies judged it as an ineffective and high-risk method. Analysis of the literature shows that the effectiveness of core decompression depends on the stage of osteonecrosis at the time of surgical intervention. Prognosis is influenced by the extent and location of the necrotic area, the presence and amount of head depression, and continued risk factors - mainly corticoid medication. The best prognosis can be given for patients with a small, medial-centrally located necrosis without head depression.
