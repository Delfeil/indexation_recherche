Improved methods of imaging the cerebral vascular system have increased the detection of traumatic or spontaneous dissection of the vertebral and carotid arteries. Especially MRI allows direct demonstration of intramural hematomas that are a sign of dissection of the vessel wall. We report on a patient who had an acute onset of dysarthria and monocular blurred vision, which recurred several times. Doppler ultrasound showed stenosis in both internal carotid arteries with reduced velocity of the flow; angiography confirmed the stenosis, showing a long stretch of stenosis (70%) of the right and a short stretch of stenosis (60%) of the left internal carotid arteries. MRI demonstrated a narrowing of the lumen by an intramural mass, whose signal characteristics were typical for blood. The MRI findings were thus consistent with the diagnosis of a spontaneous dissection of the carotid arteries. Since the Doppler ultrasound follow-up showed no change during the following 3 days, we interpreted the MRI findings as an indication of bleeding in an atheroma. The carotid disobliteration, performed first on the left side and later on the right side, confirmed this interpretation. Since stenosis due to a fissuring atheroma or bleeding in an atheroma requires different therapy than a dissection, it is thus important to consider the possible differential diagnosis in interpreting the MRI.
