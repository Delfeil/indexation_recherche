Functional voiding disturbances can be due to failure of the detrusor or to discoordinated sphincter function during micturition. Therapeutical options are directed either to strengthening the contraction up to an adequate magnitude or to lowering the voiding resistance or can be aimed at influencing both. In a brief survey mechanical, pedagogical, electrotherapeutical, and surgical measures as well as drug treatment are critically examined. Conservative methods should always be attempted before surgical procedures are performed. Depending on the degree of severity and the etiology of the disease, a combined therapy can be useful. In the case of resistance to therapy, intermittent autocatheterism is to be preferred to permanent deviation via an indwelling catheter.
