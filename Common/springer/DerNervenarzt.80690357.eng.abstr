Tumors of the tibial nerve are not sufficiently taken into account in the diagnosis of tarsal tunnel syndromes (TTS). They may present with atrophy of the plantar flectors and with disturbances of sensory functions, but far more commonly with pain. Diagnosis is often only achieved after 1-2 years. Taking tumors into account when examining patients presenting with TTS may lead to a more rapid diagnosis and to improvement in patients' prognoses. We present the case of a 37-year-old female in whom a primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) was found to be the cause of long-standing pain in the right foot.
