The histopathological classification of chronic myeloproliferative disorders can be supported by applying cytogenetics and molecular genetics to the analysis of bone marrow or blood cells, as demonstrated in 253 cases evaluated. The Philadelphia translocation (9;22) is the most important genetic parameter, being specific for chronic myeloid leukemia. Conventional methods for the detection of the t(9;22) are karyotyping and Southern blot analysis of the bcr gene. The newly established technique of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allows visualization of bcr-abl fusion even in non dividing cells. Molecular cytogenetics for t(9;22) yield results that are rapid and reliable as well as easily quantifiable.
