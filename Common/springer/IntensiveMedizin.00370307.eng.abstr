 Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by extended inflammatory processes in the lung microvascular, interstitial and alveolar compartments, resulting in vasomotor disturbances, plasma leakage, cell injury and complex gas exchange disturbances. Abnormalities of the alveolar surfactant system have since long been implicated in the pathogenetic sequelae of this life-threatening syndrome. This hypothesis is supported by similarities in pulmonary failure between patients with ARDS and preterm babies with infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), which is known to be triggered primarily by a lack of surfactant material. Mechanisms of surfactant alterations in ARDS include: lack of surface-active compounds, changes in the relative composition of the surfactant constituents, alteration of the extracellular surfactant subtype distribution, inhibition of surfactant function by plasma protein leakage, and damage/inhibition of surfactant compounds by inflammatory mediators.   Alterations in alveolar surfactant function may well contribute to a variety of pathophysiological key events encountered in ARDS. These include decrease in compliance, ventilation-perfusion mismatch including shunt-flow due to altered gas flow distribution (atelectasis, partial alveolar collapse, small airway collapse) and lung edema formation. Persistent atelectasis of surfactant-deficient and, in particular, fibrin-loaded alveoli may represent a key event to trigger fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis in late ARDS (collapse induration).   Overall, the presently available data on surfactant abnormalities in ARDS lend credit to therapeutic trials with transbronchial surfactant application. Accordingly, acute improvement of gas exchange was encountered in two recently performed pilot studies addressing the safety and efficacy of a transbronchial application of large quantities of exogenous surfactant material. In parallel to a far reaching, but yet not complete restoration of "physiological" surfactant properties in BALF, re-opening of formerly collapsed lung regions with concomitant reduction of intrapulmonary shunt flow was noticed. Although not the primarily goal in these pilot studies, a tendency towards lower mortality in the surfactant treatment groups was noted. At present, a controlled study enrolling higher patient numbers is being performed to probe the impact of a transbronchial surfactant administration on the outcome of ARDS patients.
