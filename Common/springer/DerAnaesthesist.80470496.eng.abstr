In 1847 J.Y. Simpson in Scotland was the first to describe the administration of ether for analgesia in painful deliveries. Only a few days later E.C.J. von Siebold (*1801 in Würzburg - \dagger1861 in Göttingen) performed the first systematic study on ether in obstetrics. Following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non-pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour, he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients. The first administration was on February 25th 1847. While he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new-born, he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients. He concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery, since it disturbed the natural course of labour. On the other hand, von Siebold was very pleased with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention.
