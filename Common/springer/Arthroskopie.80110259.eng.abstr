Since 1993, 30 patients with acute distal intraarticular radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance. According to the AO classification there were 3 B- and 27 C-fractures, most of them Frykman VIII fractures. Of 30 fractures 23 showed additional lesions which could only be diagnosed under arthroscopic view. In particular, 12 partial or complete tears of the intracarpal ligaments were found. Of 25 fractures 23 which were treated at least 12 months previously could be followed up radiologically and clinically. X-rays included postero anterior and lateral views to evaluate the radial angles and the radial length and stress tests to check for instability, especially of the scapholunate ligaments. Clinical examination included range of motion and objective grip strength measured with a Jamar (Cedaron) tester. Each test was performed on both wrists for comparison. Subjective data included pain and function for daily activities. Data were evaluated by the Jakim and the Cooney scoring system and the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al. About 70% of our patients showed an excellent or good result; about 15% had a poor result. However, we must mention that we were not able to reduce one C3-fracture under arthroscopic view and had to switch to a semi-open procedure with additional external fixateurs. Arthroscopically assisted treatment of distal intraarticular fractures is not only useful to detect and manage additional carpal lesions, but seems to give good midterm results as well.
