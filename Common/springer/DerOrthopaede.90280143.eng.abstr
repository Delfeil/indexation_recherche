The lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot. The equinus (a contracture of the triceps surae muscle), the abduction and clubfoot deformity are the most common ones. The present paper describes the deformities and stresses the functional relevance for the patient. Therapeutic principles of the conservative orthopaedic means are described with special emphasis on the need of an adequate height of the aide and the foot position. Casting and the application of Botulinun toxine are described having a major side effect of muscle weakening. A combination of the different procedures, surgical interventions included, need to be selected for each patient offering the best management for each individual problem.
