The aim of morphological tumour diagnosis is to answer clinical questions on type, biological potential, prognosis and aetiology of individual neoplasms. The limitations and perspectives of different methods used in the diagnosis of adrenal tumours, ranging from histology to molecular genetic DNA analyses, are described. When surgical specimens from adrenal neoplasms cannot be typed on the basis of histology and/or with clinica data (e. g., endocrine symptoms and history) as adrenocortical tumours, phaeochromocytomas or metastases to the adrenal, immunohistological investigations with a panel of different antibodies are necessary. After identification of the tissue derivation of an individual adrenal tumour, its biological potential must be assessed. Among adrenocortical neoplasms, adenomas and carcinomas can be distinguished by evaluation of various histological parameters (including structural features and signs of invasion) according to defined algorithms. In addition, conventional histology (by estimation of mitotic activity) allows the discrimination of tumours with especially high malignant potential from other adrenocortical carcinomas. In contrast, among adrenomedullary tumours even the combined use of histological, immunohistological and DNA cytophotometric techniques only allows the definition of risk groups (benign versus suggestive of malignancy), while reliable recognition of an individual malignant phaeochromocytoma is so far impossible. The question as to whether a particular phaeochromocytoma represents a sporadic tumour or a neoplasm inherited as one feature of a defined syndrome cannot be answered with the above methods, but only by the application of molecular genetic techniques.
