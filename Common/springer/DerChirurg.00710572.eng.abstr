Abstract.  We report an unusual complication in a 53-year-old woman following ileostomy for Crohn's disease 22 years previously. A stenosis of the distal colonic segment was the reason for the formation and subsequent rupture of a huge colonic mucocele. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a ruptured mucocele of colonic origin after ileostomy.
