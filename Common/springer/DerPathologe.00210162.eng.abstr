Marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MCL) of extranodal, nodal and splenic origin appear to be different lymphoma entities with a similar growth pattern in the marginal zone of the B-follicles. Decisive for the detection of MCL as a distinct lymphoma entity was the "MALT concept" for lymphoid infiltrates in the gastric and intestinal mucosa as described by Isaacson et al. in the 1980's. Immunohistological stainings for the immunoglobulin light and heavy chains and molecular pathological studies of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene configuration have subsequently confirmed the neoplastic nature of the extranodal infiltrates and differentiated marginal zone cells from mantle zone cells. In 1994, the MCL of MALT type as well as of nodal and splenic origin were included in the REAL classification and in 1998 in the new WHO classification for lymphomas. Meanwhile extranodal MCL of MALT-type have been observed in almost every organ and site of the body, by far most frequently in the gastric mucosa. Beside the typical growth pattern, lymphoepithelial lesions are a distinct diagnostic feature of extranodal MCL. Clinically, the small cell extranodal MCL show a very good prognosis with regression after treatment. As for nodal and splenic MCL, we need further studies to evaluate the prognostic aspects and to compare them with other B-cell lymphomas. The same is true for primary extranodal large B-cell lymphomas or blastic transformation to a large cell lymphoma; in these tumors the diagnosis of a MALT type lymphoma should only be made if a small cell component with MALT-specific criteria can be proved.
