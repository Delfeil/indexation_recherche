The use of non-treated cryopreserved bone allografts has been criticized followig the publication of new cases of HIV and hepatitis-C infection caused by such grafts. However, the "new" cases of HIV infection arose in 1984/1985, when HIV testing was not possible. A critical analysis of the German bone bank procedures shows that the official guidelines are not adequate. Furthermore, new sterilization techniques are propagated for clinical use. This leads to a false feeling of security, and does not help to solve the problem of virus transmission by way of bone allografts. It is therefore essential that new guidelines for bone bank management be developed as a matter of urgency, with due consideration for everything known about this problem to date. Our current bone bank procedure is presented and the various points in the official guidelines that need updating are discussed, including the necessity for 6-month HIV and hepatitis testing modified donor screening, and special guidelines for multiple organ donors.
