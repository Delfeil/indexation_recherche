 Cryophlebectomy, a more recent technique in varicose veins surgery, was evaluated in comparision with conventional techniques. Group IA: Microphlebectomy, invaginative stripping of the long saphenous vein, tourniquet, n = 90; group IB: only microphlebektomie and tourniquet, n = 72. Group IIA: Cryostripping of the long saphenous vein in combination with cryosurgical distal avulsion of varicosities and microphlebectomy, n = 112; gr.IIB: only cryosurgical distal avulsion of varicosities and microphlebectomy. Data were compared regarding duration of operation and hospitalisation and cosmetic outcome. Hospital stay (gr. IA: 9,1  +/-  5,1 d vs. gr. IIA: 6,1  +/-  2,1 d, gr.IB: 5,5  +/-  2,3 d vs. gr.IIB: 4,8  +/-  2,5 d) and duration of operation (gr. IA: 113,6  +/-  35 min vs. gr. IIA: 67  +/-  21,3 min, gr.IB: 74,4  +/-  35,3 min vs. gr.IIB: 53,3  +/-  15,5 min) were found to be significantly shorter and cosmetic result and postoperative discomforts improved in the cryophlebectomy-group. We conclude that the use of this combination of methods reduces invasivity, rises the patient's well-being and helps in cost-reduction.
