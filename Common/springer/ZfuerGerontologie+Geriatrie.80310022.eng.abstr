  The paper reviews the present state of gerontological research in South Africa and provides examples of relevant studies. So far, most of the research has focused on socioeconomic conditions, e.g., financial status, living arrangements, and intergeneration family relations. During recent years another topic has gained prominence, e.g., the subjective well-being of the elderly. Another aspect of research in this area is its inter- and multidisciplinary nature and its concern with practical relevance. Terms often used in new research on aging are "empowerment of the elderly" and "self-care strategies". In this context, the elderly are beginning to be considered as significant brokers in development planning. In the last part of the paper, the trend to qualitative methods is discussed.
