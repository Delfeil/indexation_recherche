 A 75-year-old man had painless, slowly enlarging tumors in the right and left infrascapular regions. Clinically, the tumors were nontender and semimobile. MR imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs. At surgery, the tumors were thought to be malignant, most likely liposarcomas. The histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers. Elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft-tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women. In 10 % of the patients bilateral, often asynchronous tumors are seen. Ninety-nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region. Occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities, head, and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities.
