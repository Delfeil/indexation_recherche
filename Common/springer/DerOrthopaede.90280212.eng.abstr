In the orthopedic department of the University Hospital Homburg/Saar, we use since 1993 a computer-based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations. Hardware consists of DOS/Windows PC's in a Novell-network. Our software is a combination of datbase-system for managing patient-data and a special coding program for ICD and IKPM-digits. Our experience shows that computer assisted clinic-management is an effective tool to help the surgeon in planning and documentation. Until now, we used the system for 31 500 patients and 8500 operations. A flexible software can meet the requirements both of the surgeons and administration. Moreover, in the University hospital Homburg/Saar, the different departments are linked by an Intranet with connection to other scientific networks and the Internet.
