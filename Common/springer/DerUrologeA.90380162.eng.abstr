Even complex diagnostic tests may not establish aetiology and degree of erectile dysfunction (ED) in many patients. Therefore, we evaluated a self-report method with a restrictive focus to quality of erections which may yield information sufficient to make an aetiologic diagnosis. We studied 74 patients 25 to 75 years of age with untreated ED. Sexually stimulated erections were quantified and compared to duplexsonographically and clinically evaluated data from pharmacostimulated erections. Patients reported that there was a marked decrease in ability to penetrate the partner, to sustain an erection and of penile rigidity (p < 0.001). Parameters from duplexsonography and clinically assessed response to pharmacostimulation correlated (r = 0.72). Direct comparison of these data with quantified history showed no relation (r = 0.05). Using change in penile volume due to erection as a basis to compare with, showed significant correlation with quantified data from history (r = 0.26-0.34; p < 0.03) and measured parameters from pharmacostimulated erections (r = 0.44-0.55; p < 0.0001). Sexually- and pharmacostimulated erections are proportional to change in penile volume. Although there is a relation between erections emerging from both stimulations, quantifying history on sexually stimulated erections does not qualify to make an aetiologic diagnosis without using complex tests.
