Background: One of the main advantages of the no-stitch technique in cataract surgery is that induced astigmatism occurs less frequently than with any other procedure and stabilizes within a very short time postoperatively. The resultant high wound strength enabled us to alter the incision parameters in an attempt to indentify those which influenced postoperative astigmatism, the ultimate goal being to improve the prognosis of the expected astigmatism. Since the influence of tunnel width and incision length and shape were well known, we investigated the influence of incision depth and site and that of various parameters in a prospective randomized and controlled clinical trial.
