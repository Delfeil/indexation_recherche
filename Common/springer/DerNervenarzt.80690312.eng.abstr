In the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness. The interaction between the patient with ALS and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication, especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support. The patient and his family must be informed thoroughly about the natural history and the prognosis of ALS, depending on the individual disease process. Already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled. If ALS patients are not informed about the acute respiratory insufficiency they run the risk of having to be intubated and mechanically ventilated over a long term.
