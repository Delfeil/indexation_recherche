 The article gives a short review on the history of the field. First forensic cases were solved by the use  of medicocriminal entomology in the thirteenth century but the method has only developed to a professional level over the last 100 years. In Europe, mainly French, Belgian, English and Scandinavian researchers have been responsible for maintaining the methods. In France, an entomological police laboratory has been set up in Rosny-sous-bois. In contrast to the United States of America where entomological evidence is accepted by the courts, the method has only just started to be accepted in Germany. Initially cooperation with the police and with judges might help to establish the analysis of arthropods as a routine tool in forensic science for Germany.
