Expert forensic assessment of spinal fractures is based on the classification of the injury, since this allows conclusions on the prognosis and on the extent of instability. Operative treatment strategies are aimed at a properly aligned spinal segment that can sustain normal strains. The resulting fused section and its localization in the axis organ vary in their relative functional value, which has to be considered when dimished fitness for work is evaluated. In addition, lesions caused by surgical access must be taken into account, as must earlier injuries and any predispositions to disablement.
