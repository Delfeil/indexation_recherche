The Ph1-negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) are described, and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given. These are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2,331 patients with CMPDs among a total of 34,160 patients referred between 1 January 1989 and 30 June 1994 to the Bone Marrow Registry. These cases of CMPD break down into the main groups as follows: CML 23.2 %, megakaryocytic myelosis consistent with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia 22.3 %, essential thrombocythemia 22.1 %, and polycythemia vera 20.4 %; 12.0 % of cases were unclassifiable. Histological progress in each group is characterized by (1) increasing number and pleomorphy of megakaryocytes, (2) increasing fibrosis, and (3) excess of blasts. These three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively. A staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced. Its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic biop-sies.
