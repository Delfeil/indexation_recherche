 We report a case of leakage of irrigation fluid into the extra-articular soft tissue, due to rupture of a Baker's cyst during arthroscopy of the knee joint. A four - quadrant fasciotomy of the calf musculature was performed to prevent the devasting ischemic complications of an imminent compartment syndrome. A survey of the literature reveals no consensus regarding the treatment of such complications. On the contrary, some authors recommend avoiding fasciotomy and waiting for spontaneous reabsorption of the irrigation fluid.
