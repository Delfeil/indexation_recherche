Injuries of the forefoot are a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. After healing of bone and soft tissue damage, posttraumatic metatarsalgia can persist. The paper presents a therapy algorithm with newly designed insoles, which consist of the common orthopaedic adaptions like a rocker bottom and a stiffening of the sole. The therapy is shown on two cases. With these orthotics adequate is possible and pain relief realistic.
