Since the early 1960s the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) has been one of the most frequently used standardized methods in international psychiatric research. The BPRS is used mainly for the rating of psychopathological symptoms of schizophrenic subjects. According to the results of factorial analyses, the original version of the BPRS is divided into five subscales, which have been preserved in the German translation. The validity of this original scale structure for the German BPRS version has not been investigated, however.
