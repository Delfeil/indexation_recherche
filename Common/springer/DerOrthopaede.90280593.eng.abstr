Lumbar Microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach. The microscope is the best surgical aid. Alternatives are a retractorintigrated light or headlamp. A specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy - the wrong level - can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning. Other complications like dural lesions and exessive bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view. The most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation, major vessel or visceral injury, can be avoided by lusing the new rongeur with a depth guard.
