 In the stage of acute cerebro-vascular insufficiency, operative treatment is of higher risk because no recommendations are available concerning diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In the years 1995 and 1996, 876 operations on carotid arteries were performed. Twenty-seven cases, i.e. 3.1%, were in a neurologically unstable stage of cerebro-vascular insufficiency. Three patients died due to their neurological deficit. Two other patients developed a completed stroke in spite of an immediate operation. In 10 cases an improvement of the neurological disorders was observed, and 12 patients showed a complete recovery. This means a complication rate of 18.5%. The results of operative treatment under unstable neurological conditions are promising. Extensive diagnosis with duplex ultrasound and cranial CT scan is mandatory. Surgical intervention alone is not sufficient for a positive outcome. Close cooperation between diagnostic, conservative and operative medicine is of vital importance.
