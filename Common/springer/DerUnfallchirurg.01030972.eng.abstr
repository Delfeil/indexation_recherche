The aim of this study was to evaluate the retropatellar pressure, force, and contact area in cases of knee arthroplasty compared to knees without arthroplasty. We examined six leg specimens before and after knee arthroplasty. The modified Thiel fixation was used, and arthroplasty was the Genesis I without patellar implant (Fa. Smith & Nephew, Schenefeld). Contact measurements were performed with pressure-sensitive film (Fuji Prescale type "super low") in 45 °, 60 °, 90 °, and 120 ° knee flexion. The results were evaluated with special software, "Pressure Imaging and Analyzing System FPD-901 Series". The leg was exarticulated in the hip joint and the knee joint was opened from a suprapatellar approach. The film was placed at a defined area between the facies patellaris of the femur and facies articularis of the patella. Instantaneous pressure was measured during a time of 5-s pressure increase and a further 5 s. A force of 280 N was applied to the quadriceps muscle. Before knee arthroplasty, the contact area measured 154.3 mm2, the average pressure was 1.14 MPa, the force 182.13 N. After knee arthroplasty, the contact area was 119.94 mm2, the average pressure 1.522 MPa, the force 180.98 N. Following knee arthroplasty the contact area decreased significantly (P=0.015), and the average (P=0.0001) and maximum pressure (P=0.0003) increased significantly. The force did not change significantly (P=0.7642). The choice of the knee arthroplasty implant and approach to the knee joint should be considered in order to achieve an increased retropatellar contact area thus preventing smaller contact areas than before knee arthroplasty. The increased contact area could also prevent increasing retropatellar pressures after knee arthroplasty and further complications.
