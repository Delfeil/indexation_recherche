Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a rare but clinically distinct disorder which is easily overlooked. It commonly occurs in older men and, because of its similarity to epileptic seizures, is often misdiagnosed. The etiology of RBD is still unknown. However, there is an interesting association with Parkinson's disease which presents some pathophysiological hypotheses. Treatment is usually successful with clonazepam.
