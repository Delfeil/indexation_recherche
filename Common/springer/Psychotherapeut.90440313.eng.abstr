In a questionnaire study 470 consecutively admitted women were interviewed, who were admitted to a clinic for addict women. As a control group 181 women were interviewed who were admitted to a general hospital an showed no substance abuse. Women with substance abuse were more often sexually abused in childhood (24,5%) than women with no substance problem (10,2%). With addict women the perpetrator more often belonged to the close social surroundings or the family itself. In this group there were more serious cases of abuse. The parents showed less supportive behaviour. So these patients experienced a harmful connection of risk factors and missing protective factors, which altogether led to the substance abuse. It is therefore necessary to implement a special treatment program for these women.
