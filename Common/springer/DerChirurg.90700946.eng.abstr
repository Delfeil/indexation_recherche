 The traumatic pulmonary hernia is a rare and uncommon observation. We report a case of a 52-year-old patient who had a car accident. Beside multiple polytraumatic injuries we were able to diagnose an incarcerated pulmonary hernia. Hernia size, incarceration and the respiratory insufficiency of the patient necessitating immediate surgical intervention. We relocated the hernia into the chest and stabilized the thoracic wall. The postoperative course was uneventful.
