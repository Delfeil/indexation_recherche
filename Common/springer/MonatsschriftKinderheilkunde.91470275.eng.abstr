A clinically healthy 6 week old infant underwent cardiological examination because of a slight heart murmur. On echocardiography, we detected a round thrombus of 4 millimeters diameter originating in the ductus arteriosus Botalli and extending into the pulmonary artery. Molecular testing (PCR amplification method) revealed a heterozygous mutation responsible for factor V Leiden. No additional risk factors could be detected neither in the case history nor in the laboratory findings. The clinical course until the age of 17 months remained normal. She was not treated, but a prophylactical anticoagulation is recommended for the case of risk situations (surgery, menstruation, pregnancy).
