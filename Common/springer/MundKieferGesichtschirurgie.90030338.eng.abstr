From the aesthetic point of view, a patient can be completely rehabilitated after the loss of an eye with the insertion of an artificial eye made of glass. If the delicate structures of the eyelids have been severely damaged, however, or if the eye socket does not provide adequate retention for an eye prosthesis, rehabilitation becomes more difficult, and sometimes cannot be achieved with a cosmetically satisfactory result. In such cases, a facial prosthesis offers an alternative solution. Stable retention can be ensured with craniofacial implants. Single-sided rehabilitation by this method is quite common, but bilateral treatment is a rarity. We report on the prosthetic rehabilitation of a patient after exenteration on both sides due to retinoblastomas.
