  We report on a 65 year old man, in whom an ICD was implanted. Seven months later we found a remarkable close relation between the tip of the ICD electrode and the distal part of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). LAD seems to be compressed from electrode during systole. This is possibly the cause of an ischemia in myocardial scintigraphy.
