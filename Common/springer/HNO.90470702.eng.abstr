Microsurgery of the larynx is commonly performed as direct laryngoscopy (DL) under general anesthesia. An alternative in selected cases is flexible laryngoscopy (FSL) under local anesthesia. We used a flexible laryngoscope that contained an additional working tunnel (Olympus ENF Type T3). Local anaesthesia of the larynx was achieved with 1% oxybuprocaine-HCl. Tissue samples were taken under endoscopic view and control. Twenty-five patients were studied and had benign lesions of the larynx or were being followed after treatment for cancer. The examination was tolerated well by all patients. The handling of the endoscope allowed precise targeting and sample taking. Due to the 2.2 mm diameter of the forceps the sizes of the biopsies were also limited. However, nearly all of the biopsies taken allowed sufficient histological examination. The advantage of the FSL was its simplicity and the minor inconvenience for patients. Although true histological results of suspect findings are possible, limitations in examining the hypopharynx prevent true staging of cancer patients. In general, FCL is a worth-while complement to DL.
