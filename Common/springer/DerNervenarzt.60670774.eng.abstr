We analyzed psychiatric and criminological data from 103 arsonists. The following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to DSM-III-R and IDC-10 seem appropriate. First, the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising, since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives quoted in DSM-III-R may also have an aggressive motive. Second, ICD-10 gives being drunk and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania. This seems untenable, since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol misuse. Repeated firesetting, resulting from being fascinated by fire etc., may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a psychoinfantilism, which, supported by alcohol abuse, extends into older age. The mean age of such arsonists is slightly above 20 years. The tendency for relapses after imprisonment seems to be low; this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age. The mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below 30 years, those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35, deluded arsonists have a mean age of 40 years. Concrete sexual motives are relatively rare. Approximately 50 % of arsonists have a purely aggressive motive. Retaliation is a rare cause, however, since most of them do not even know the victims. One third of these persons set the fire in their own homes. Most arsonists show a personality disorder, with insecurity and narcissism predominating. Data on firesetting are to be treated with caution, since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved; one fourth of cases concern minors, and in Central Europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists.
