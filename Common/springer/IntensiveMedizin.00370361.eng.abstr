 Like pain, dyspnea is a sensation that is not well understood and may have many causes. It is a frequent symptom in the emergency medical service and presents diagnostic problems and pitfalls in assessing severity. Dyspnea is a very common symptom in patients with cardiorespiratoy diseases. Diagnostic tests like pulse oximetry, blood gas analysis, capnometry or fiberoptic bronchoscopy often only allow a better assessment of severity but no diagnostic classification of dyspnea. Basic support includes clearing of upper airways, keeping the airways patent and establishment of artificial ventilation when necessary. Further therapeutic interventions depend on the suspected etiology of dyspnea.
