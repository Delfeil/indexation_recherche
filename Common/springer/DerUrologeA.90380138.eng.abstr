The disadvantages of high flexible endoureteral stents (DJ) in case of tumorinduced extrinsic ureteral compression are due to an insufficient vertical stability of the used stents leading to stent-compression and consecutive hydro- or pyonephrosis. The new developed tumor-stent used in case of tumor-induced ureteral compression is available from 6 to 8 French in diameter and 24 to 32 cm in length. The corpus consists of a combination of high-stability plastics but is of sufficient elasticity in length. Both ends consist of extremely elastic J-parts guaranteeing an exact fixation. As against common DJ's with the same outside-diameter the new stent has a comparable interior diameter and compared to used "old" tumor stents promises a higher interior flow in case of extrinsic diseases. The application can be undertaken in well-known technique, needs no special instrumentation and no learning-curve. To date 52 stents at our urologic departments were placed without any problems, the latest remaining for 15 months. Tumor-induced compression or a higher rate of encrustation could not be seen. All patients tolerated these stents well. In our opinion the new stabilized endoureteral stent can be seen as a better solution instead of percutaneous nephrostomy or frequent stent changing in patients with tumor induced extrinsic ureteral compression.
