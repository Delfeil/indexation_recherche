 Objective: Evaluation of the scores APACHE II and III, SAPS II, and MPM II for risk stratification and quality control in patients of a German interdisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: The data of all consecutive patients of a 12 bed interdisciplinary intensive care unit were collected over a 12 month period. The score values and probabilities of hospital deaths were compared with observed outcomes. The discriminatory power was analyzed by calculating the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration by standardized mortality ratios (SMR), and goodness-of-fit statistic. Results: Of 1,000 admissions 96 were repeated ICU stays. Due to exclusion criteria of the scores 883 patients could be analyzed for APACHE II, 775 for APACHE III and SAPS II, and 638 for MPM II. Mean age was 61.5 (16-96) years, 67.2% were medical, 32.8% surgical admissions, 37.4% of those after emergency surgery. ICU stay lasted 3.9 days, hospital stay 26.4 days. ICU mortality was 7.6%, hospital mortality 17.2%. Areas under the ROC curves were calculated as 0.81 (APACHE II), 0.82 (APACHE III), and 0.83 (SAPS II and MPM II). The SMR was 1.00 for APACHE II, 1.19 for APACHE II, 1.09 for SAPS II, and 0.99 for MPM II. Calibration was good for APACHE II (chi-square 6, p>0.5), SAPS II (chi-square 9, p>0.3), and MPM II (chi-square 12, p>0.1), but insufficient for APACHE III (chi-square 19, p<0.025). Mortality ratios for various diagnostic groups differed as well as the pattern of the four score systems in different risk strata. Discussion: Discriminatory power of all four score systems was similar in our patients. Calibration was insufficient for APACHE III, but good for APACHE II, SAPS II, and MPM II. These three systems could be used for internal quality control in our unit. But differing prognostic accuracy for various risk strata and subgroups as well as differences between the scores indicate that other factors than the overall quality of an ICU influence the results.
