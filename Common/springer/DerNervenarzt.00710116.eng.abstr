Eight patients with spontaneous spinal epidural hemorrhages are presented. All eight initially had suffered from severe neck or back pain. In seven cases, progressive neurological deficits had developed, some of which led to complete paraplegia. On all eight patients operations were performed. After an average of 11 weeks' follow-up, full recovery from the preoperative pain and neurological deficits could be seen in 6 of the patients.
