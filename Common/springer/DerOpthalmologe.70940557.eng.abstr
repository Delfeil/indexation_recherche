Background: Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) is important to the ophthalmologist, since eye symptoms are usually the first evidence of the disease and permit establishment of an early diagnosis. The disorder usually begins with a dramatic loss of vision between age 4 and 10 due to bullseye maculopathy followed by rapid degeneration of the retina and pigment epithelium. Blindness results within 1 to 3 years after onset of symptoms. The further course of the disease is mainly determined by degradation of the CNS with motor and intellectual deficits. Most patients die before the age of 30.
