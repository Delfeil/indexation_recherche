Controlled clinical trials demonstrate that treatment with surfactant lowers mortality, incidence of pneumothorax and probably incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very premature infants. The degree of respiratory support needed also decreases with surfactant treatment. We analysed whether equivalent results could be achieved in routine clinical practice now that this therapy is generally available. Population: All 760 surfactant-treated infants with birth weight <1500 g admitted to a hospital taking part in the Westphalia-Lippe neonatal survey from 1990 to 1992. Main outcome measures: Measures of respiratory support were frequency of nasal CPAP, O2>30% on more than 28 days and intubation for more than 14 d. Further outcome variables used were mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia in survivors, pneumothorax, patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage grade III-IV and retinopathy of prematurity in survivors as neonatal complications. In addition, the outcomes for neonates in hospitals with small and with large numbers of surfactant-treated patients and the out-comes for infants born in the hospital and those born elsewhere and brought into the hospital subsequently were compared. Results: Apart from a lower incidence of patent ductus arteriosus in the neonatal inquiry of Westphalia-Lippe our results were similar to those in the most recently published meta-analysis. Since the approval of surfactants for treatment in 1990 there has been an improvement in the results from the aspects of mortality, survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and incidence of such pulmonary complications as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pneumothorax. The amount of respiratory support needed has also demonstrably declined. The outcomes for neonates in small neonatal units did not differ from the outcomes of those in large neonatal units. Infants admitted to the hospital after birth were at higher risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia than those born there. Conclusion: In general, population-based results of surfactant treatment in the study region from 1990-1992 were similar to those of recent meta-analysis of clinical studies.
