  In cooperation with Rüsch Inc., we developed a new catheter for complete surgical revascularisation of myocardium with both arterial and venous bypass grafts using a left lateral thoracotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted by drainage of the femoral vein and cannulation of either the descending aorta or the femoral artery. The left internal mammary artery was prepared and connected in the traditional fashion. Peripheral anastomoses of the venous grafts were made in the traditional technique, while the central anastomoses originated from the descending aorta. Occlusion of the aorta by an intraaortic balloon, administration of cardioplegic solution, and decompression of the heart were accomplished with the newly developed catheter technique. The tri-lumen catheter is balloon-tipped and is inserted at the left ventricular apex. Then, the balloon is advanced through the left chamber and the aortic valve to securely occlude the ascending aorta under echocardiographic control. Cardioplegic solution is instilled into the coronary arteries through a second lumen which is directed above the aortic valve. The third lumen opens into the left ventricular cavity and is used as a vent drainage. The new technique was used in one patient to date, and allows for both the administration of cardioplegic solution and complete cardiac decompression.
