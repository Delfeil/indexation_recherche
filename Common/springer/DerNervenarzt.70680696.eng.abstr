Psychiatric symptoms may be caused by  systemic autoimmune diseases. Quite often, mental disorders are an early symptom during the course of an autoimmune disease and sometimes they may even be the presenting symptom. This article reviews psychiatric and neurologic symptoms in systemic lupus erythematodes, Sjögren syndrome, primary vasculitides and other immunopathies such as the primary antiphospholipid syndrome and Sneddon's syndrome. The article also discusses diagnostic aspects and therapeutic options if an autoimmune disease as cause of a psychiatric or neurologic symptom is suspected. An increased awareness of psychiatrists and neurologists will make it possible that systemic autoimmune diseases are early identified as a possible cause of psychiatric symptoms and may then be treated adequately.
