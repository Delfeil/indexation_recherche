 Late results of interventional procedures utilizing coronary stents are largely determined by the rate of restenosis. So far few data are available addressing the effect of stent design, implantation pressure and morphologic factors on this crucial variable. Therefore we analyzed the coronary angiogramms obtained in 259 patients before, immediately after and at 3 to 6 months following stent implantation for obstructive coronary disease. A total of 196 AVE-Micro-Stents and 142 Palmaz-Schatz-Stents were implanted into 307 stenoses. In 126 stenoses there were implanted only Palmaz-Schatz-Stents, in 170 only AVE-Micro-Stents and in 11 Stenoses there were implanted Palmaz-Schatz- as well as Micro-Stents. Restenosis was defined as an over 50% stenosis at follow up. No significant difference was detected with regard to global restenosis rate at an average of 4 months following implantation (Palmaz-Schatz 33%, Micro-Stent 27%). If results were analzyed according to implantation pressure however, there was a significantly lower restenosis rate for AVE Micro-Stens implanted with > 10 atm (17%) as compared to <= 10 atm (35%, p < 0.02) and as compared to Palmaz-Schatz-Stents (34%, p < 0.02), which were also implanted with high pressure over 10 atm. In addition to implantation pressure, vessel segment and morphology of stenosis proved to be important determinants of late results. In this series of patients the AVE-Micro-Stent compared favourably to the Palmaz-Schatz-Stent not only with respect to a significantly lower restenosis rate, when implanted with pressures > 10 atm, but also with regard to its superior flexibility and handling characteristics.
