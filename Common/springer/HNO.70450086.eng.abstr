Specific hearing aid selection and careful fitting are essential for successful rehabilitation of hearing-impaired children. For this reason the different hearing aid types prescribed, the type and frequency of hearing aid insufficiencies reported and the effectiveness and regularity of our followups were studied evaluating 253 followup exams in 39 children (71 ears) suffering of a sensorineural hearing loss, including all degrees, supplied with a behind-the-ear hearing aid. Most of the devices had been prescribed outside our department on an initial trial basis. After critical evaluation, the number of hearing aid types was reduced from 33 to 23 when corresponding devices failed to match well with the degrees and types of hearing losses present. A further decrease in hearing aid types could not be achieved as a consequence of many being already end-prescribed. Insufficiencies (n=222) were found in 60% of the hearing aid evaluations: 59% involved dynamic hearing aid adjustments requiring better amplification (37%), distorsion (18%) and dynamics (4%). Additionally, 16% affected hearing aid function and another 16% form (9%) and material (4%) of the otoplasty and the tube (3%). The last 9% of the deficiencies concerned the potentiometer cap: it hadn't been fitted in about half of the cases and had been lost in the other half despite being needed. Routine followup evaluations of the hearing aids occurred regularly in 76% of the cases with an effectiveness of 73%. Our results confirm the importance and necessity for pedaudiologic qualitative hearing aid controls in children.
