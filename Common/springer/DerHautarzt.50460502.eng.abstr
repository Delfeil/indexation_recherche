A 71-year-old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft X-ray therapy (total dose 28 Gy, half dose depth 10.5-11.5 mm). 5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed. This unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy, presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens. In this case it is improbable that the pemphigus was induced by the radiotherapy, as has been reported on several occasions in the literature. However, this possibility cannot be entirely excluded.
