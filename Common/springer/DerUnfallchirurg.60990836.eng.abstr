This retrospective study investigated the stability of the small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration used in the treatment of 42 mostly unstable distal radius fractures (types A-3.2, C-1.2 and C-2.1 according to the AO classification). No bone grafting was performed. All cases were documented with antero-posterior and lateral X-rays preoperatively, 0, 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively and after consolidation. Early functional aftertreatment was started one week after surgery. Thirty-six fractures showed a dorsal comminution, combined with osteopenia in 18 cases. The mean preoperative radial angle of 17 ° was normalized to 25 ° postoperatively. The mean preoperative volar angle of minus 30 ° was reduced to 12 ° postoperatively. None of these mean angles changed until consolidation. The external fixator was removed on average after 7 weeks (range 6-10 weeks) depending on the radiological fracture healing. The small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration proved to be stable enough for early functional aftertreatment of the wrist. Its stability is related to a proper operative technique and correct indication (unstable Colles type with one or two distal fragments). Bone grafting is unnecessary if the external fixator is left in situ until bony consolidation.
