 A prospective follow-up study was undertaken in patients undergoing surgical therapy for primary hyperparathyroidism to establish the frequency of concomitant surgical procedures and their influence on the morbidity of cervical exploration. From 1 August 1987 to 15 October 1995, 231 patients underwent cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism. In 16 patients 18 (7.8 %) concomitant abdominal and thoracic surgical procedures as well as surgical interventions for soft-tissue tumors were performed. A total of 133 patients (57.6 %) underwent thyroid resections of varying extent; 4.8 % had carcinoma of the thyroid. Catamnestic data were obtained on the basis of a standardized follow-up in 94.4 % of all patients (1-9 follow-up examinations in 216 patients). Hematoma occurred after adrenalectomy in a patient undergoing a concomitant extracervical procedure. In patients with a first manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism due to a solitary parathyroid adenoma (n = 189), an increase in the morbidity of parathyroid surgery performed in combination with a thyroid resection was observed. Furthermore, a relationship was established between the number of intraoperatively identified parathyroid glands and the incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism (permanent hypoparathyroidism: initial cervical intervention with parathyroid exploration alone, 2.2 %; with concomitant thyroid resection, 6.5 %; after secondary thyroid resection and parathyroid exploration alone, 0 %; after concomitant thyroid resection, 28.6 %; four parathyroid glands identified intraoperatively, 3.1 %; fewer than four parathyroid glands identified, 8.2 %). The increase in the morbidity of parathyroid surgery in combination with thyroid resection is justifiable, because unsuspected thyroid carcinomas can potentially be treated curatively.
