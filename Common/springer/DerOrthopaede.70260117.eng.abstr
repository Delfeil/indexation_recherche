While the principle of enlarging the surface area has been recognized and used in different ways for some time, there is often no schematic, detailed description or fundamental research. Taking a surface structure consisting of trabecular three-dimensional connecting elements, essential parameters are shown, making it clear that the flexible dynamic reaction of the effective "anchoring space" with a suitable specified shape (construction height, alignment, network) can be reproducibly shaped and used. This has led to a hip endoprosthesis with a graduated surface structure. The construction height of the trabecular structure varies, decreasing from proximal to distal.
