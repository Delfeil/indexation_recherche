Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the method of choice for the treatment of solitary stones in the kidney or ureter. Early lithotripters required prolonged immobility of the patient and caused considerable pain, necessitating general or epidural anaesthesia during the procedure. Modern lithotripters are quicker, but still require analgesia. Intravenous opioids are currently the drugs in favour. The opioids most commonly used are fentanyl and its shorter-acting analogue, alfentanil. The latter has a more rapid onset and, because of its reduced lipid solubility, is less cumulative. Sufentanil is a new opioid that is also of the phenylpiperidone group and has been recently licensed and introduced in Germany. Its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties suggest an intermediate duration of action, high analgesic potency, and cardiovascular stability with diminished respiratory depression. In this prospective double-blind study, the effects of alfentanil and sufentanil on cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, the quality of analgesia, degree of sedation and the number and type of side-effects were compared.
