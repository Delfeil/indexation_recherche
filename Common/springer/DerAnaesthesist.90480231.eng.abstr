This case report presents the perioperative management of double-sided hip arthroplasty in a patient (female, 25 years old) homozygous for sickle cell anemia (SS). The fraction of sickle hemoglobin (Hb S) to total hemoglobin was monitored with an automated cation exchange microcolumn chromatography. The main purpose of ion exchange chromatography is to measure glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) in diabetic patients. Furthermore, as a by-product, this test enables the quantitative assessment of aberrant hemoglobin molecules such as sickle cell hemoglobin Hb S with sufficient precision and selectivity. The standard method, hemoglobin-electrophoresis is more complicated and not generally available. For the perioperative estimation of the risk for sickle cell related complications and as a guide for transfusion therapy, knowledge of preoperative Hb S level is essential. In this case report, the clinical use of a rapid laboratory test at low costs with common equipment in a patient with known homozygous sickle cell anemia is demonstrated.
