Background: Chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea. The appearance of corneal changes does not seem to be related to dose and duration of treatment. Chloroquine accumulates in lysosomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate microscopic changes of corneal morphology in patients treated with chloroquine in vivo.
