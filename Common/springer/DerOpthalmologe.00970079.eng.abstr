Background: The occurrence of apoptosis in choroidal neovascularizations (CNV) has only been described previously in a few cases. However, little is known about the extent and function of apoptosis. We analyzed the incidence of apoptosis in order to find new options in the therapy of CNV. Particular attention was given to the length of time that the process existed before surgery in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
