Capnometry, the noninvasive measurement of end-expiratory CO2 concentration (cCO2, vol%) or calculation of its respective partial pressure (pCO2; mmHg) is an established method. However, for prehospital settings, capnometry is still used very restrictively, mainly owing to the respective devices used. The prerequisite for their use is sufficient accuracy ( +/- 2 mmHg) and easy handling. Two special capnometers (STAT CAP, Nellcor: mainstream, semiquantitative estimation; Capnocheck 8200, BCI: sidestream, quantitative measurement, numeric display), developed recently for potential use in emergency medicine, are said to fit these criteria. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation was to assess the accuracy and precision of both devices, comparing methods under standardized in vitro (reference gases) and in vivo (intubated and ventilated patients) conditions.
