We present the case of a 35-year-old patient suffering from schizoaffective psychosis. After 4 weeks on clozapine he developed acute priapism. Possible explanations and pathophysiology are discussed as well as the requirement for sufficient information of the patient. Delay of urgent urologic treatment incrases the risk of irreversible impotence. The patient's history should be evaluated with respect to former unphysiological prolonged erections.
