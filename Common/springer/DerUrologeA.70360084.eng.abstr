In the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis. A special case of a thirty-eight-year-old male asylant from Nepal was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain. To exclude testicular torsion, a diagnostic exploration of the scrotum was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation. Under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared. The diagnosis of filarial funiculitis was made after identifying the microfilariae in a blood vessel and in the peripheral blood smear. A filaricide medication with diethylcarbamacine citran was administered with good symptomatic relief.
