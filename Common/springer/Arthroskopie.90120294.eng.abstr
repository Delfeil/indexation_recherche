The clinical application of cartilage repair procedures is currently being discussion. To define cartilage lesions with respect to localization, degree of cartilage damage, size, and etiology we retrospectively reviewed data from 4408 patients who had knee arthroscopies. Chondral lesions were divided into traumatic (n = 572, mean age 30.2 years; 13.2-52.7 years) and degenerative (n = 976, mean age 51.4 years; 27.1-79.9 years) lesions. All traumatic cartilage lesions were associated with isolated anterior cruciuate tear. The time interval between injury and arthroscopy was subdivided in patients with acute anterior cruciate ligament tear (< 6 weeks) or with chronic joint instability (> 6 weeks). Isolated degenerative cartilage lesions were subdivided in patients aged <= 40 years and > 40 years. Patients with other associated lesions were excluded. Because we believe that patients with grade III cartilage lesions under the age of 40 years represent the ideal type of patient to receive cartilage or osteochondral transplantation, the data set was analyzed further to characterize these patients. In both groups (traumatic and degenerative) the medial femoral condyle and the medial tibial plateau were most affected. Grade III lesions increased in number and size in all compartments with age by about 2-3.5-fold. The medial tibial plateau showed a significantly higher alteration of about 13-fold in patients aged > 40 years. The two subgroups comprising acute and chronic anterior cruciate ligament tears did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences in any parameter. Potential candidates for cartilage grafting accounted for 82 patients (5.3%) on the medial femoral condyle and for 33 patients (2.1%) on the medial tibial plateau of all cartilage lesions (n = 1548 in this data set. In conclusion, we found no relationship between time of surgery and degree of traumatic cartilage lesions after anterior cruciate ligament tear. The development of grade III cartilage lesions in patients older than 40 years was significantly higher on the medial tibia plateau than in the other compartments. That means that extrinsic factors have more influence on the cartilage damage than genetically determined factors. In respect to the observation that most of the patients achieve a total knee arthroplasty because of osteoarthritis on the medial compartment, all cartilage reconstructive procedures should be focused on the medial compartment.
