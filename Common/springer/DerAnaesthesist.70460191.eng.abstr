Introduction: Almost all patients treated with opioids suffer from constipation. Numerous laxatives are used to overcome the problem, but none has yet been found to yield favourable results in all patients. Several studies have attempted to reverse opioid-induced constipation by the use of oral naloxone. Experiments carried out in rats showed that morphine-induced constipation is reduced by oral naloxone without impairment of antinociception [4]. However, evaluation of clinical studies reveals that there is uncertainty about the dosage regimen (the daily dose of naloxone ranged from 0.5% to about 60% that of morphine) and a lack of larger numbers of patients studied.
