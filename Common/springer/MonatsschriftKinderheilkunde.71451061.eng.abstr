Coats' disease is characterized by teleangiectatic and aneurysmal changes of the retinal vessels with secondary intra- and subretinal exudates. In most cases vision can be preserved by therapy at an early stage. In rare, advanced cases a total retinal detachment causes amaurosis. This case is the first description of Coats' disease associated with DiGeorge-Syndrome. We report the case of an eight year old boy, who suffered from headache after ear surgery (tympanoplastic type I). Retinoblastoma could be exluded and Coats' disease was diagnosed by ophthalmoscopy, computertomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Discussion: Until today the cause of Coats' disease is unknown. The coincidence with DiGeorge-Syndrome seems to be accidental.
