 "Idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia is an exclusion diagnosis. The underlying reasons and mechanisms of "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardias are still not completely understood. Recent investigations showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the right ventricle of patients with "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia out of the right ventricular outflow tract, which could often be correlated with the origin of the ventricular tachycardia. These described abnormalities were not uniform. Here we report about a patient suffering from drug-refractory "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia for 10 years. This is the first report in which the origin of an "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia could be localized by right-ventricular angiography, magnetic resonance tomography and electrophysiological study in the area of an interventricular septal thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract and cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation.
