 Infectious complications related to acquired neutropenia have become a major medical issue, often requiring intensive care management. These infections may be lethal if empirical broad-spectrum treatment is not rapidly started at the first sign of infection (i.e., fever), and this concept is now widely recognized a standard practice. However, the choice of antibiotics has generated considerable controversy for nearly 25 years.
