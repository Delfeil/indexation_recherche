 There has been almost no change in the basic guidelines on cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the last 30 years. The introduction of early defibrillation programs and further propagation of resuscitation skills in the entire population are steps for improvement which have not yet been fully realized.  On the other hand, some basic rules for resuscitation have to be reconsidered with skepticism. The guidelines for pulse control are apparently insufficient for correct diagnosis, and the value of mouth-to-mouth ventilation in nontraumatic sudden cardiac death in adults must be re-evaluated.  However, there are some promising new aspects for the use of the active compression-decompression resuscitation and other newly developed mechanical resuscitation techniques. With respect to electrotherapy external defibrillation utilizing a biphasic shock may lead to higher efficiency, higher survival rates, and less myocardial damage. As far as adjuvant medication is concerned, vasopressin was reported to be superior to suprarenin in a small randomized study and may soon become the substance of choice in special situations such as refractory ventricular fibrillation. This also holds true for amiodarone which may play a major role in antiarrhythmic therapy in refractory ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia.
