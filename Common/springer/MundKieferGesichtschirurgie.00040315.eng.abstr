Clinical and histopathological results in human tumors indicate that the connection of solid tumors to the vascular system precedes the exponential tumor growth and further progression. Acknowledging the concept of tumor angiogenesis, the search for angiogenesis inhibiting agents as potential drugs in cancer treatment began rather early. In the present preclinical nude mice model, the antitumoral effect of TNP-470 on xenotransplanted squamous cell carcinoma was tested. The chosen dosage of 30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg resulted in a significant growth inhibition (P = 0.006 and P = 0.01) compared to the control group. The available in vivo and in vitro data lead to the conclusion that the concept of angiogenesis inhibition will have some impact on treatment of solid tumors in the near future.
