 The monoclonal antibody c7E3 (ReoPro) is a highly selective inhibitor of platelet aggregation that binds to the fibrinogen receptor (GP IIb/IIIa) on the surface of platelets and leads to a dose-dependent, nearly complete inhibition of platelet aggregation. The clinical value of c7E3 to reduce ischemic events after PTCA in addition to heparin and aspirin has been demonstrated in the EPIC-, EPILOG-, and CAPTURE-trial. In these studies, c7E3 was associated with an increased bleeding risk after the coronary intervention.
