A 46-years old male patient suffered for several years from painful swelling of the distal soft tissues of the great toes associated with onychodystrophy. Mycological studies were negative. By means of radiological and scintigrafic examination and because of the typical clinical signs, the diagnosis of psoriatic onycho-pachydermo-periostitis of the great toes was established. The syndrome which is highly evocative of rheumatoid psoriasis was first discribed by Fournié and co-workers in 1989. Oral retinoids were helpful in diminishing both pain and soft tissue swelling of the great toes.
