Two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on. One case is well documented. In both cases there was very good functional adaptation, resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement. The rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage. The function of the supraspinous muscle is also discussed.
