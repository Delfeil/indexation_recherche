Background: Phacoemulsification with topical anesthesia is a proven alternative to peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia. Application of lidocaine in the anterior chamber before surgery is one method to achieve good intraoperative analgesia. The purpose of this study was to find out whether there are any differences in the postoperative course between patients with peribulbar injection and patients with topical anesthesia.
