Since the publication of a case of Syphilis transmission by blood transfusion in 1915 the discussion about transfusion-associated bacterial infection is ongoing. For some time, virus infections through blood and blood products have been highlighted. However, in the last years the attention required has been drawn to the problem of transmission of bacteria. In this publication the present situation concerning the contamination rates through blood components and the frequency of transfusion-associated microbial infections is outlined. The bacteria involved are discussed. Furthermore, the state of the art for prevention and diagnosis as well as the methods for inactivation of bacteria are assessed.
