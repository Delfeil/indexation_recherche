 Intensive care patients bear a high risk to manifest "systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)", sepsis, septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction which are associated with a high mortality rate. As a consequence of an initial infection or trauma, a hyperinflammatory activation of the immune system follows and an anti-inflammatory response (named "compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS)" occurs consecutively. This latter state manifests as systemic immune dysfunction, anergy and causes increased susceptibility to infections. Results of clinical and experimental studies are discussed providing evidence for the use of a hematopoietic growth factor named granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to counteract this immunodeficiency. In non-neutropenic, posttraumatic/postoperative patients with an increased risk of sepsis, G-CSF increases neutrophil count and function and decreases the incidence of sepsis. Moreover, recent studies suggest that G-CSF contributes to an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in hyper-inflammatory states and is considered as a promising therapeutic agent given prophylactically. Thus, G-CSF may activate neutrophils on the one hand and at the same time may counteract progression of an excessive inflammatory reaction due to anti-inflammatory effects on the other hand. In this context, G-CSF treatment appears to be a promising therapeutic option in intensive care patients at risk of sepsis, SIRS, CARS and the "mixed antagonistic response syndrome (MARS)". Regarding effective therapy of hyperinflammatory states of sepsis, SIRS and MARS as well as the secondary, transient immunodeficiency of CARS and MARS by G-CSF, the drug will have to be administered to accurately defined patient groups and due to optimal timing and dosage schedules.
