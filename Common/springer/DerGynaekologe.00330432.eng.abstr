Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy renders beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids. Additionally, direct protective mechanisms of estrogens in the blood vessels and myocardium are under study. Recent findings suggest an improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and coronary microcirculation. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that this treatment has cardioprotective effects on the left ventricular geometry, i.e., nomial left ventricular mass and wall thickness. Whether the beneficial effects of estrogens are counterregulated by a combined use with progestins is not yet known and requires further investigation.
