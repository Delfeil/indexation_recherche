We report on ten patients with idiopathic non-traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee. Arthroscopic evaluation showed various bleeding sources. Besides vascular abnormalities (e.g., hemangioma) or meniscus lesions we found signs of bleeding from severe degenerative osteochondral lesions. Surgical therapy, mostly with arthroscopy, led to good results.
