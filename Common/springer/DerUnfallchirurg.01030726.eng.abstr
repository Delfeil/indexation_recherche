The optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed. Most authors prefer delayed surgery. The definition of the term "acute" varies between 48 hours and 4 weeks. In this study the limit was set at 60 hours. Acute ACL reconstruction was performed in 39 patients and delayed surgery in 35 after they had regained full ROM. The incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44% lower in this population. When the indication is clear, we think that acute ACL reconstruction may be performed within 60 hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis. Nowadays, this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons.
