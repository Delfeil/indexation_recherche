A young woman presenting with marked menstrual blood loss and prolonged bleeding after only minimal injuries was investigated. Because of an extremely prolonged PTT (more than 200 s) we measured the factor XII activity and found a severe deficiency. The bleeding symptoms however could be ascribed to the existence of von Willebrands disease type 1. In addition, the patient had an elevated resistance against activated protein C (APC-resistance) and a moderately elevated concentration of homocysteine in her blood plasma. At the genomic level we found heterozygosity for the factor V mutation G 1691 A and the mutation C 677 T in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)-gene. The analysis of the factor XII gene revealed the existence of a point mutation in the promoter region (G->C transversion, nt-8). The same mutation could be found in the paternal factor XII gene. The low factor XII activity in the woman seems to be the result of a second mutation originating from the maternal factor XII gene (compound heterozygosity). However, this second mutation could not be found up to now. In the sister of the women, a 15 year old girl, there is also a marked menstrual blood loss. The coagulation analysis revealed reduced activities of the factor XII and also von Willebrands disease type 1. The reduced factor XII activity seems to be compatible with the heterozygous state of factor XII deficiency. In the girl there was also an increased APC resistance, corresponding with heterozygosity for the factor V mutation G 1691 A. Mother and father are heterozygous for the factor XII deficiency and the mutation C 677 T in the MTHFR gene. In the mother homozygosity for the mutation in the factor V gene (1691 AA) could be found. All family members investigated exhibited elevated D-dimer concentrations in the plasma.
