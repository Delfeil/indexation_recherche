Single stage urthroplasty with an onlay patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease. Using buccal mucosa, operative time is substantially reduced by using a two-team approach in which one team harvests the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and calibrates the stricture. Excellent results can be expected using grafts urethral substitution in men with refractory bulbar strictures. Focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed. For patients with long or dense strictures, grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques.
