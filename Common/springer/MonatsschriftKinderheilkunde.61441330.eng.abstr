Background: N. meningitidis infections may present as severe fulminant sepsis with poor prognosis. We assessed the frequency, age distribution, hemostaseological skin findings, need for intensive care therapy and prognosis of this infection. Methods: The data were collected using an active monthly surveillance system, the "Erhebungseinheit für seltene pädiatrische Erkrankungen in Deutschland (ESPED)" from July 1994 to June 1995 in 320 childrens hospitals in Germany. Patients over to the age of 16 were excluded. The answering rate was 91 %. Results: 291 infections according to the case definition (N. meningitidis in blood culture and/or cerebrospinal fluid) were reported. Frequency peaked in the first year of life (n = 87) and from age 13 to 16 (n = 53). Intensive care measures (mechanical ventilation, dialysis, catecholamines) were needed in 42 children; 29 of those survived. The overall mortality was 4.5 %, but was relatively higher in 5-6 year old children (15 %). Petechiae and small hematomas (< 10 mm) were a frequent finding (112/291 [38 %] patients), all these children survived. Ecchymoses (> 10 mm) and/or skin necroses were observed in 82 children; 12 (15 %) of those died. Four survivors required surgical interventions for correction of necroses (skin transplants and/or amputations). Conclusions: Petechiae and small subcutaneous bleedings (< 10 mm) are not indicative for an unfavourable prognosis of N. meningitidis infections. The overall mortality was low (4.5 %), however, despite early antibiotic therapy relatively high in 5-6 year old children (15 %). The findings ecchymoses and/or skin necroses alone are not sufficient to evaluate the efficacy of innovative therapeutical measures.
