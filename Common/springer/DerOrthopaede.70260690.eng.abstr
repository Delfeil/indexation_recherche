Irreparable damage to the motor function of the ulnar nerve results primarily in paralysis of the intrinsic muscles and reduces the functional capacity of the hand by about one-half. Tendon transfers are therefore indicated when the following grasp functions are impaired: (1) claw hand with dyskinetic finger movements; (2) impaired thumb adduction with limited key pinch power; (3) instability of the index MP joint; (4) adduction weakness of the little finger. The various procedures and transposition techniques are discussed and the author's preferred methods of tendon transfer are presented.
