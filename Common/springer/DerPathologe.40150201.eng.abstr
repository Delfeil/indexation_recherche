The present study exemplifies the method of quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) by quantifying, in bovine tissues, the specific mRNAs for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) -receptor and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mRNAs. The LDL-receptor mRNA expression was highest in the adrenal gland (6.7 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the corpus luteum of the ovary, intermediate in the liver (8.6 x 102 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and not detectable in the large intestine. Expression of the HMG-CoA reductase almost paralleled LDL-receptor values. It was found to be highest in the ovary (6.1 x 106 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the adrenal gland, intermediate in the liver (3.1 x 105 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and lowest in the large intestine (9.9 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA). These data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches. Thus cRT-PCR is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the LDL-receptor and the HMG-CoA reductase.
