In this publication, Nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms, etiology and pathogenesis. The diseases to be considered when making a differential diagnostis are pointed out. Clarification of the etiology is still pending. Molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings. A case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist. Possibilities and problems in relation to therapy are demonstrated.
