Injuries of the flexor tendon are usually open injuries. In most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons. This is different for injuries of the extensor tendon. Three quarters of injuries of the extensor tendon are closed injuries. Therefore we do go into primary and secondary reconstruction of the flexor tendon, but focus on primary and secondary reconstruction of the extensor tendon in the most common zones (1, Th I, 3, Th III).
