Two children on chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had initially focal, then generalized seizures of short duration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed in one case minor parietal, cortical and subcortical increased signal on T2-weighted images. In a second case extended supratentorial lesions and additional signal changes in the cerebellum were found. Although chemotherapy was continued, a few days later signal changes were considerably reduced or had disappeared. We consider these lesions to be seizure induced in a brain previously sensitized by chemotherapy.
