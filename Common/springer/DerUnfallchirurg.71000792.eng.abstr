Skin and soft tissue necrosis of the heel are the main problems following open reposition and fixation of calcaneal fractures. In order to demonstrate how the classic approaches harm the supplying vessels, the classic medial, lateral, enlarged lateral and bilateral approaches have been simulated in ten lower limbs prepared by arterial latex injection. Bases on anatomic literature and on these findings, we have proposed two modified approaches that minimize damage to the vessels of the adjacent soft tissues yet allow exact reposition of the fractures.
