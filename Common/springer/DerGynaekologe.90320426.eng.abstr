The mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation. The heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy. During late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position. A fall in heart rate was only seen in this period. A fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy. The hypotensive symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy. Headaches, fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints. The frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation. Blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women. However, the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position. The Birth-weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position, but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing. Pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight. These results imply a hitherto unknown cause of intrauterine growth restriction.
