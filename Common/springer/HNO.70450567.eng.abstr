Bilophila wadsworthia is an obligately anaerobic, gram-negative rod, which was first described in 1989. The natural habitat of this species seems to be the lower intestinal tract where it was recovered from about 60% of the persons investigated. Bilophila wadsworthia is mainly associated with intra-abdominal infections, but the species was also isolated as part of aerobic-anaerobic mixed infections at various extra-abdominal sites. Otological infections due to Bilophila wadsworthia have as yet not been described. In the present paper, we report a case of a patient with postoperative otitis externa following stapedectomy, probably caused by the anaerobes Becteroides fragilis and Bilophila wadsworthia.
