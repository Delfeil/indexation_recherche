Objective: Antifibrinolytic drug therapy has proved to be effective in reducing blood loss associated with cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Concerns remain regarding the risk of enhancing thrombosis. In the present study we investigated the effect of aprotinin (AP) and tranexamic acid (TA) on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during CPB.
