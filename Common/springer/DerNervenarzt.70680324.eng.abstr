Sixty-three patients with tick-borne encephalitis were studied for sequelae up to  5 years after the acute illness (median:  12 months, range: 1-44 months). Patients were examined clinically, by neuropsychological testing and by electroencephalography. The clinical presentation during the acute stage was as follows: Meningitis  (M, n=12), Meningoencephalitis (Me, n=27), Meningoencephalomyelitis (My, n=15), and Meningoencephaloradiculitis (R, n=9). A total of 59 patients reported a neurasthenic syndrome after discharge, which correlated with the severity of the acute illness. Twenty patients were not able to work because of reduced stress tolerance, fatigue or an elevated emotional sensitivity, which lasted for  3 months at most. In some patients hypacusis (n=7), severe dysarthria and dysphagia (n=4) remained essentially unimproved for years following the acute illness. While in  8/9 patients with radiculitis paresis of the  extremities improved well over months to years, improvement was quite limited in all patients with myelitis. In 41/55 patients, investigations by electroencephalography revealed normal findings even within months after acute illness. Persistent cognitive deficits were present only in 7/11 patients with a severe course of disease.
