Abstract.  The term "granulomatous slack skin" (GSS) was introduced by Ackermann for a disease first described by Convit et al. in 1973. GSS represents a rare cutaneous lymphoma characterized by localized elastolytic lesions with a granulomatous infiltrate. We recently observed two male patients with the characteristic features of this disease. Both patients responded well to therapy with interferon-2b. In one patient clinical remission was stable under long-term treatment with clofazimine. We report on common features of these two patients and give a review of the cases published in the literature.
