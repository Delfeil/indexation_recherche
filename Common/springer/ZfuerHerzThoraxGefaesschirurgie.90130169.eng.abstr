 From January 1983 through December 1996, 112 adult patients (the age ranged from 17 to 67 years, mean 41 years) were operated for an ASD at the "Klinik für Herz- und Thoraxchirurgie der Universität Würzburg". This retrospective study analyzed the pre-, intra-, peri-, and postoperative data after surgical closure of the ASD in 73 female (65%) and 39 male (35%) patients. Most common was the ASDII with 79% (89/112 patients). 18% (20/112 patients) were treated because of a SVD and only 3% due to an ASDI. The results of the postoperative cases of 110/112 patients (98%) were collected with a follow-up period between 8 months and 14 years, a mean follow-up of 8 years. The results showed that the pressure in the right heart and in pulmonary hypertension increased with age (p<0.05) as well as in heart failure (measured in NYHA classes) (p<0.05). Intraoperative data such as the length of operation (145 +/- 38min.), bypass (53 +/- 28min.), and ischemia period (29 +/- 17min.) were independent of age as well as (preoperative measured) hemodynamic data. Two patients were operated once again because of a persistent shunting in the follow-up period. No patient died during the intra- or perioperative time. One patient died 8 years after the surgical closure due to congestive heart failure at the age of 75. Postoperatively, heart failure significantly improved (p<0.05). The average preoperative NYHA class of 2.6 improved to 1.7 postoperatively. The patient's state of health in the follow-up period improved after the operation in 83/110 cases (76%). 20/110 patients (18%) did not feel a change and 7/110 patients (6%) felt a negative change in their state of health. The results from this study point out that the operative closure of the defect even at an older age is an operation with a mortality less than 1% and there is a benefit in operation. Parameters like the age of the patients or increasing pulmonary hypertension are actually no reason to refuse patients for operation. A corrective operation is not indicated any more if the pulmonary resistance had led to an Eisenmenger reaction. The optimal time for operation is a young age in order to prevent paradox emboli and pulmonary hypertension with their complications.
