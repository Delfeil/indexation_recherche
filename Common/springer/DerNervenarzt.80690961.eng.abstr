In order to examine the efficacy of whole body acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in depression, a single-blind placebo-controlled study with 70 inpatients administered to three different treatment groups has been carried out. All patients were pharmacologically treated with the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin. The verum group (n=22) received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression. The placebo group (n=24) was treated with acupuncture at non-specific locations and the control group (n=24) received only pharmacological treatment. Acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks. Psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum/placebo conditions twice a week over eight weeks with the CGI, GAS, BRMS and BfS rating scales. Additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself. However, we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture.
