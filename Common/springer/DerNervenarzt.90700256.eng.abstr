In clinical practice and in research projects the presence of an advance directive or an appointment of a health-care proxy may substantially contribute to decisions of  diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, if a person has lost his ability to consent. A special questionnaire was given to a non representative sample of 206 elderly inpatients suffering from different psychiatric disorders. The majority of these patients (57%) supported the necessity of such instruments. In a further 5,4% of the interviewees written documents, either advance directive or  determination of a health-care proxy, were already present. However, 25% of the interviewed patients did not approve of the  usefulness of these instruments and 12,5% answered that they were not able to give any decision. Among the interviewed patients, age, gender and the psychiatric disorder present were not associated with approval or refusal. However, higher education was related to the approval of advance directives.
