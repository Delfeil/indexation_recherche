Because the vascularization of ligaments is an important factor in ligament healing we wanted to examine the vascularization status of the medial collateral ligament of the knee. The type of vascularization was examined by mikroangiographie of 21 postmortem preparations. We could observe a vascularization from the proximal end of the ligament by one or two major vessels in all cases. These vessels were mostly localized in the ventral third of the ligament. From the proximal to the distal part of the ligament we found a decreasing density of blood vessels. We could not observe vessel free ligament areas. Due to this vascularization status we would advise the differentiation of two ligament areas respecting the following therapy. Because of the good vascularization in the proximal part of the ligament we can accept good conditions concerning complete healing after a non-operative treatment and an operative therapy by suture or refixation. In the case of interligamentous and distal ruptures operative reconstruction by sutures often is difficult and a conservative therapy leads to a high rate of poor results. Therefore we advise fibrin bonding in these ligament areas if a surgical procedure is indicated because of the high risk of vessel strangulation after suture.
