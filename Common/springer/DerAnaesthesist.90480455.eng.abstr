Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure persisting over 10 min or repeated seizures without recovery between the attacks. SE is  a frequent medical emergency with a high mortality, requiring aggressive and prompt treatment and a systematic, coordinated approach. A variety of new drugs has been introduced for the treatment of SE, including midazolam, propofol, fosphenytoin, and valproate. However, there are very few controlled clinical trials. Benzodiazepines are highly effective in terminating the SE in most patients and should be used as initial treatment. Phenytoin and Phenobarbital are employed if Benzodiazepines are not successful. The optimal therapeutic approach  for the patient with refractory SE remains  to be defined. Refractory SE has a poor prognosis and should be treated in a specialized ICU with EEG-monitoring. Barbiturates, propofol, and midazolam are substances that can be used alternatively.
