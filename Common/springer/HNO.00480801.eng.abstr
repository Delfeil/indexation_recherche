In the ancient times, Aristotle, Herophilos, and Galen discovered basic anatomical structures. Paul von Aegina, in the seventh century a. c., had the idea of a nerve suture, which was first performed in an animal 1000 years later by the Italian surgeon Gabriele Ferrara. Systematic investigations on nerve crossing date to the beginning of the nineteenth century and were conducted by Jean Pierre Flourens. Within 1 week in summer 1864, two French surgeons (Laugier and Nélaton) independently carried out the first nerve sutures in humans. Their observations of an immediate functional recovery of the appropriate muscles after suturing were discussed controversially in scientific circles.
