 The accuracy of the RR interval data acquisition is an essential prerequisite for reliable analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). In previous laboratory investigations, in which computerized electrocardiograms were simultaneously sampled at identical heart rates using digital and analog tape recorders, the superiority of the digital recorders was clearly demonstrated. Conventional tape recordings exhibit technical variability which may produce false positive HRV results. However, the clinical significance of this type of variability is not known.   Aim of the study: To characterize the clinical relevance of technical RR variability related to the conventional tape recording process.   Methods: In 20 patients with cardiac disease and stable sinus rhythm, 24-hour Holter monitoring was performed by connecting each patient simultaneously to a conventional tape and a digital Holter recorder (Ela medical) via the same leads. Technical variability was defined as the difference between the HRV results obtained by the respective analog (A) and digital (D) recording methods.   Results: For the following HRV indices significant A-D differences were found: SDNNindex: 38.47ms (A) vs. 36.17ms, p=0.003; RMSSD: 25.04ms (A) vs. 21.09ms (D), p<0.001; pNN50: 3.70% (A) vs. 2.40% (D), p=0.006; Total power: 1200.20ms2 (A) vs. 1076.55ms2 (D), p=0.032; LF power: 287.35ms2 (A) vs. 243.80ms2 (D), p=0.035; HF power: 72.50ms2 (A) vs. 54.95ms2 (D); p=0.001, and the LF/HF ratio: 4.47 (A) vs. 5.33 (D), p=0.037. No significant differenes were found for the following indices: SDNN: 95.59ms (A) vs. 94.74ms (D), p=0.29; and SDANN: 85.52ms (A) vs. 85.08ms (D), p=0.68.   Conclusions: Under both experimental and clinical conditions, higher HRV values were found in the conventional (tape) recordings. However, the technical variability was small in comparison with the mean values of normal HRV indices and their standard deviation. Thus, differences due to different recorder technology may be neglected in clinical practice. Nevertheless, in scientific HRV trials, it seems wise to use digital Holter recorders.
