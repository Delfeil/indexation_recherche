 In a patient with recurrent ulcer disease under medication, which was complicated by episodes of bleeding, a laparoscopic partial gastric resection with intracorporal Roux-en-Y anastomosis was performed. The operation was completed within 3 h with blood loss < 10 ml. The postoperative hospital stay of 6 days was uncomplicated as was the further follow-up (2 months so far). This operation and the study of results published in the literature showed us that a gastric resection can certainly be performed laparoscopically in the appropriate patient.
