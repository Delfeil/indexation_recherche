Wet autoclaving is a simple, reliable and time-effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed archival material. Both routine diagnostic (e. g., oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cytoskeletal proteins) and research antibodies (e. g. various p53 antibodies, mdm-2, bcl-2, MIB-1) are reported to demonstrate its application. Wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin-embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections. The technique has the poten-tial to reliably handle up to 200 sections at a time, without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology.
