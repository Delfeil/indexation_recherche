Recurrent transverse myelitis is a rare inflammatory demyelinating disorder, which is distinguished from acute monophasic transverse myelitis and from MS. We present two patients with recurrent transverse myelitis, who developed an acute remitting tetraparesis and sensible deficits with a cervical level. They were followed for 4 and 5 years. MRI showed an isolated lesion with contrast enhancement in the spinal cord but no pathological cranial findings. Oligoclonal bands were negative in repeated lumbar punctures. One patient showed lymphocytic pleocytosis during the first and second attack. Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials were abnormal during relapses while visually and brainstem acustically evoked potentials (VEP and BAEP) stayed within limits. Laboratory examinations for bacterial, viral or parasitic infections, antinuclear antibodies, Angiotensin-converting enzyme and the sedimentation rate were also normal.
