Absorbed radiation doses delivered by computed tomography and panoramic radiography were measured in 16 anatomic sites using a head and neck phantom and thermoluminescent dosimetry. The recommended kilovoltage and scan time for dental scanning was reduced step by step, rating the quality of the low-dose scans. A reduction of up to 76% could be achieved without loss of diagnostic accuracy. Measured absorbed radiation dose ranges from 0.30 mGy (thyroid) to 29 mGy (skin) at 187,5 mAs and 1.0 mm-slices (25 mm scanning distance for maxilla, 30 mm for mandible). After reduction to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid) to 6.9 mGy (skin) was measured. Distance measurements on human jaw specimens were compared with corresponding CT image measurements. Average deviation was 0.1- 0.3 mm. A dose reduction of 75% had no effect on the results. However, the doses of CT-scans reduced by 76% exceed by an average factor of 10 the doses of conventional panoramic radiography. Therefore, CT should be reserved for the planning of complex implant treatment in the direct vicinity of the maxillar sinus and nerves and for multiple implant insertion.
