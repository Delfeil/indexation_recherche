 Spontaneous rupture und false aneurysms of the non-arteriosclerotic aorta are rare. We report on a 53-year-old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by semicircumferential aortic end-to-end anastomosis. After 6 months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft, transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch. The iliac reconstruction was performed by PTFE interposition. There was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis. At 1 year follow-up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms.
