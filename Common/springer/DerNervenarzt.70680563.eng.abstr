This study examined the changes from hospital admission to discharge of different categories of cognitive distortions - automatic thoughts, self-concepts and dysfunctional attitudes - in 67 patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of a depressive episode. Furthermore, the relationships were analyzed between cognitive distortions, degree of depression, and personality dimensions (isolation tendency, extraversion, rigidity, schizoidia, frustration tolerance and neuroticism). There was a significant correlation between automatic thoughts and negative self-concepts on the one hand, and severity of depression on the other upon admission. There was a significant reduction of automatic thoughts and the negativity of self-concepts from admission to discharge. No significant association was observed, however, between the severity of depression and dysfunctional attitudes. In addition, dysfunctional attitudes showed a significant decrease until discharge only in patients with a full remission of depressive symptoms. These results underline the fact that automatic thoughts and self-concepts are more state-dependent than dysfunctional attitudes. Moreover - even taking into account the degree of depression - there was a significant relationship between the personality dimension neuroticism and all cognitive scales upon admission. This indicates that a high degree of neuroticism may facilitate the emergence of negative cognitions during a depressive episode.
