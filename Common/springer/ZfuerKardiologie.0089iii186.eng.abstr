 Radiofrequency catheter ablation has established itself as a first line therapy for the curative treatment of many patients with spuraventricular or atrioventricular tachycardias and also for selected types of ventricular tachycardia. The success rates of catheter ablation of various types of cardiac arrhythmias are impressively high. Procedure related complications can be attributed to the invasive nature of the technique (e.g., bleeding or other vascular complications, radiation exposure) but may also occur as a specific complication related to the type of intervention performed (e.g., complete AV-block following attempted modification of the AV-node). In patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation procedures, radiation exposure carries a small but measurable risk of malignancy and hereditary disorders. The risk of fatal malignancy has been calculated to be approximately 1permil per hour of fluoroscopy and the risk of significant hereditary disorders approximately 10 per 1 million live births per hour fluoroscopy time. However, it is important to realize that these risks are age and sex dependent being higher in young and/or female patients. For the physician performing catheter ablation procedures no significant risks related to fluoroscopy exposure may be expected as long as all established tools for protection are used. Based on the results of large single center studies and multicenter investigations, complications during or after radiofrequency catheter ablation of supraventricular or atrioventricular arrhythmias may occur in 4-5% of cases. Severe complications (life threatening or permanently disabling complications) may occur in approximately 1-2% of patients treated. In patients undergoing ablation of ventricular tachycardia, a higher incidence of total procedure related complications between 5-7% and severe complications (3-4%) may be expected. The higher incidence of complications in patients with ventricular tachycardia when compared to catheter ablation of supraventricular or atrioventricular tachycardia may be explained by the fact that many patients with ventricular tachycardia suffer from severe cardiovascular disease.
