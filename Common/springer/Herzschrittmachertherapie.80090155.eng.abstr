 In the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy, little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias.  In a group of 54 patients with documented ventricular tachycardia during longterm ECG recordings, the determinants for the development of VT and the relationship between signal-averaged ECG and the morphological characteristics of the disease are investigated.  The analysis of the long-term electrocardiographic data includes the measurement of RR-intervals 30, 15, 5, 1min and immediately before onset of the VT, the determination of the morphology of the previous ventricular premature beats, and the frequency of the atrial arrhythmias. Normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ECG signal accquisition with bidirectional filters between 40 and 300Hz were defined a maximum of 113ms for a QRS width, LAS of 38ms, and RMS40 of 16uV. The analysis of the long-term ECG produced monomorphic VT in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only 4 cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats. A long-short phenomenon could only be proven in 4VT episodes. In 84% of all tachycardias, no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event.  According to the circadian clock, two peaks, mornings between 6 and 9h and evenings between 6 and 9h, could be determined. In patients, who were recently diagnosed with ARVD, a significant shortening of the RR intervals before the onset of VT as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed. This effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of AVRD.  Late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74% overall. Increasingly, late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the ARVD. A correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias (ventricular, sustained or not sustained VT) could not be established. In comparison to the origin of VT in coronary heart disease, previous arrhythmias play a less important role in arrhymogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy. Most importantly, an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of VT and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed.
