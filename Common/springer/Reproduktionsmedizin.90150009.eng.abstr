 Causal treatment regimens of proven effectiveness in controlled studies are only available for cases of male infertility resulting from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized studies. On the other hand, inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy, e. g. with kallikrein, tamoxifen, clomiphene, pentoxifylline, mast cell blockers, testolactone, vitamin E, captopril, alpha receptor blockers, glutathione, indomethacin, interferon alpha, growth hormone, zinc salts, ketoprofen, mesterdone or testosterone undecanoate, are inconsistent, or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement. Recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure FSH, while GnrH and FSH have no influence on spermatogenesis in normogonadotropic men.
