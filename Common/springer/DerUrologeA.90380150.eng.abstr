We present our experiences with the approach of placing 2 parallel ureteral Double-J stents simultaneously in extrinsically obstructed ureters. In all 5 reported patients therapy with single ureteral stents had failed despite correct stent position. With the increased stiffness of 2 parallel ureteral silicon 7F Double-J stents ureteral kinking and luminal compression could be reduced leading to sufficient reduction of hydronephrosis. This approach with potential space between the stents preserves urinary flow through as well as around the stents which is considered to be the most important mechanism in stented ureters.
