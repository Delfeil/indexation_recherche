A growing branch of neuroscience is investigating conditions that permit neurogenesis in the adult brain. Partially, this aims at using the neuroectodermal stem or precursor cells that persist in the adult brain to induce neuroregenerative processes in the treatment for neurologic disorders. In ex vivo approaches, isolated precursor cells are implanted into the host brain, while in vivo concepts favor a stimulation of precursor cells in situ.
