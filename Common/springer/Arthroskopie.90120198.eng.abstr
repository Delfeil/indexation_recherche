Insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a typical complication. Between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1997 a total of 604 operations at the ACL were performed in the traumatology department of Nuremberg hospital. During the same period 48 "transplant failures" were treated. There were various reasons for the failure of the transplant, some of them technical, occurring during the operation or during aftercare. Another reason for a re-rupture of the transplant was by trauma.The different reasons for the failure of the transplant were analysed in our patient population. The 48 patients were classified into five groups depending on the primary operation and the means of treatment (I = ACL sutures, II = artificial ligament, III = semitendinosus tendon, IV and V = ipsi- or contralateral bone-patellar-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction), so that the different ways of treatment were better comparable. Of the 48 patients 36 were followed up over an average of 2 1/2 years using the Lysholm scores and the OAK scores. The total score of the 36 patients was 81 points and can be valued as good using the evaluation scale of Lysholm and Gillquist. Using the OAK score we found an average of 71 to 81 points in the different groups; results in the group with the ipsilateral bone-tendon-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction were the worst. The totalscore using the OAK score was 74 points and was considered "moderate". The score results were discussed and compared with the current literature.
