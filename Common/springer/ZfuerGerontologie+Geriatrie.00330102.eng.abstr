 The use of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in the field of geriatrics faces some specific problems. Deficits in representation of older people in medical trials and the attitude of the majority of patients and their physicians considering disease as normal aging counteract successful implementation. EBM is also feasible in older patients after some adjustments without dropping the principles of the method or the preferences of patients, thus, resulting in improvement in diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.   The methods are exemplified in the use of prophylactic antibiotics in endoscopic gastrostomy, a relevant geriatric problem with practical consequences.
