 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a well-established method for the diagnosis of diseases of the heart and the great vessels. Almost 20% of all patients cannot be completely examined by transthoracic echocardiography. In this patient group, MRI can be used as a second line technique to provide important diagnostic information not obtainable by echocardiography. However, there are clinical problems for which MRI may be used as the first line technique such as complex congenital heart disease, diseases of the great vessels, pericardial disease or cardiac tumors. MRI is undergoing rapid technical improvement and this will further improve the diagnostic utility of the technique, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.
