 Today, orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end-stage of various liver diseases, and a 1-year survival rate of 80 % and a 5-year survival rate of 70 % in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys. The liver transplant programme of the Inselspital in Bern is small compared with international centres, which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme. Over a period of 66 months, 62 liver transplantations were performed in 60 patients at the Inselspital. The hospital mortality was 3.3 %, and the 2.5-year overall survival rate was 92 % for elective cases without tumor. After a median follow-up of 30 months, 68 % of all patients were re-integrated in housework or full- or part-time in their profession, and 83 % were independent from the help of others. We conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards.
