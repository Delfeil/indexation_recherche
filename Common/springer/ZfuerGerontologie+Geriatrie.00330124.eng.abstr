Results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented. 329 persons were interviewed three times (quantitative study) and 20 persons conducted a semi-structured diary (qualitative study), covering in both groups a two-year period (from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement). They were asked about their subjective well-being (happiness, joy, satisfaction, stresses), their life situation and their personal, social and material resources. The results show that the transition to retirement brings with it gains (leisure time) and losses (financial, social status), but overall maintains a high level of well-being. Specific analyses point out inter-individual differences, risk factors and resources, like a high level of trait well-being, health, social networks and an optimistic outlook. The diary analyses lead to specifications, more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects. Consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed.
