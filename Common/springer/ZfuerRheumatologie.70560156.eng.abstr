 Recent studies have shown a high frequency of genetic hemochromatosis in the Caucasion population. In addition, the well known organ involvement of genetic hemochromatosis was evident; more than 50% of patients develop a typical arthropathy which may result in severe physical disability. Among approximately 5000 patients referred to the rheumatology outpatient clinics of Bad Nauheim and Frankfurt with different rheumatologic diagnoses, 11 patients with typical signs of hemochromatotic arthropathy were identified. In none of those cases had the diagnosis "genetic hemochromatosis" been previously established. These patients had been treated for rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatologic disorders over several years. All showed severe organ dysfunction due to iron overload, resulting in a reduced life expectancy. This investigation shows that knowledge of the typical signs of hemochromatotic arthropathy could lead to an earlier diagnosis of genetic hemochromatosis which is necessary to prevent the complications of iron overload in those patients.
