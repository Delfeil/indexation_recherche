The term "mild cognitive impairment" refers to cognitive deficits which exceed normal physiological aging processes, but do not fulfill the criteria for dementia. The prevalence rates of four current concepts were compared in a sample of 202 healthy 60-64 year-old participants recruited from the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging (ILSE). Furthermore, the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined. The following prevalence rates were determined: 13.5% for age-associated memory impairment, 6.5% for age-consistent memory impairment, 1.5% for late-life forgetfulness and 23.5% for aging-associated cognitive decline. Subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests. Significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales. Significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status. Longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts.
