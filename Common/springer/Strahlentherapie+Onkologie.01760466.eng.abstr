 The treatment of malignant tumors consists in the optimal combination of the 4 modalities surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. An important goal of clinical research is the development of the optimal application of each of these modalities.  This review of the literature focuses on the importance of the total treatment duration and dose intensity in the development of chemotherapy regimens. Three important malignant diseases will be examined as to the optimal application of systemic chemotherapy.  Tumor models with the resulting hypotheses and well-designed clinical trials will lead to progress in the treatment of malignant tumors.
