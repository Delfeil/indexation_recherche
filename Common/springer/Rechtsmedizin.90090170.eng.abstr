 The HIV-1 status of 10627 drug abuse-related fatalities (8754 males, 1873 females) was evaluated in an international multicenter study over the last 13 years. Of these 1054 (9.9%) were HIV-1 positive (males: 8,7%, females: 15.8%). In Germany the HIV-1-prevalence of drug abuse-related fatalities has shown a decrease during the 1980s and has stabilized at a level of about 10% since 1991. The HIV-prevalence in northern and middle Europe has stabilized at less than 10% but in southern Europe the prevalence rates over the recent years are about 50%.
