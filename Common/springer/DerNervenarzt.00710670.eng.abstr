Recently, sudden "sleep attacks" have been described in parkinsonian patients taking the nonergoline dopamine agonists pramipexole and ropinirole. Due to this possible side effect, patients must be instructed not to drive vehicles and to refrain from other activities carrying the risk of self-injury. However, the very existence of sleep attacks remains controversial in sleep medicine, since a gradual transition from wakefulness to sleep is normally observed. Accordingly, sudden onset of sleep, e.g., in narcolepsy or sleep apnea syndrome, is usually associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Prevalence of sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness have been shown to be increased in Parkinson's disease. Nonergoline dopamine agonists are already known to induce somnolence. Currently, it is not predictable whether sleep attacks represent a sudden transition from wakefulness to sleep or result from an increased propensity to fall asleep, with patients perceiving a sudden onset. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms and legal implications of sleep attacks are discussed.
