Abstract.  We report on a male patient with mycosis fungoides (MF) with blisters mainly occurring on clinically uninvolved skin. This rare association has to be differentiated from other bullous diseases of the skin. The clinical picture has been known since the end of the last century and has been described as mycosis fungoides bullosa. The pathomechanism, however, has not yet been exactly identified. The different clinical and histological features of the disease are discussed.
