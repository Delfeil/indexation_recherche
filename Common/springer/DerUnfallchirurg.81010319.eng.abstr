Closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature, perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor. Most often the rupture occurs as a consequence of a sudden plantar flexion of the ankle and pre-existing degenerative changes of the tendon tissue due to systemic disease or iatrogenic local corticoid injections. Clinically, the tendon rupture presents as acute weakness of the ankle extensors without reddening, swelling or neurological signs. Differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded. During the clinical examination the distal stump and the discontinuity of the anterior tibial tendon are often palpable. The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination. An operation may be undertaken up to 3 months after the injury. Preferred procedures are end-to-end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon, followed by a plaster cast for 6 weeks postoperatively. High-risk patients can be treated conservatively, but the functional results are less satisfactory. We describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon. A yet unpublished method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented.
