Background: Disorders with the key symptom of periodic fever include familial Mediterranean fever, cyclic neutropenia, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome, and Behçet disease as well as the PFAPA syndrome (perodic fever, aphthous stomatitis pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis). Out of these the PFAPA syndrome probably occurs more frequently than it is diagnosed.
