The crucial factor deciding the success of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a sufficient oxygen supply. At about 4 min after cardiac arrest, cerebral death results because of hypoxia, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation has to be started regardless of the pathogenesis of the cardiac arrest. The purpose of the study was to assess the application of guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation by participants at a dental surgery congress (n = 96) and to evaluate previous knowledge in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and knowledge after instruction. The present study was based on the standards and guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation issued by the American Heart Association. The group was divided into four groups of doctors experienced or inexperienced in clinical emergencies or with dummies. For the study the Skillmeter-Resusci-Anne (Laerdal, Stavanger, Norway) was used, which has automatic data recording. After analysis of the individual errors, the success of new instruction was assessed. Good previous knowledge was registered, particularly with respect to checking respiration and hyperextension of the head (67.7%), primary insufflation (93.8%), closed-chest cardiac massage (99%) and correct compression rate (68.4%). The participants demonstrated post-instruction improvement in all subdivisions except in the group without practice on dummies (primary insufflation: from 94.4 to 88.9%; correct order of checking consciousness and respiration, primary insufflation, the carotid pulse and closed-chest cardiac massage: from 22.2 to 5.6%). Good results with marked improvements in the second passage were achieved in checking consciousness and the carotid pulse, closed-chest cardiac massage and correct implementation of compression. The participants were, however, found to be in need of further education and training  in diagnostics and certain cardiopulmonary resuscitation measures. Knowledge should be improved concerning recognition of the emergency (42.7%), checking the carotid pulse (22.9%), the correct order of primary insufflation and closed-chest cardiac massage (9.4%), correct implementation of compression (21.8%) and ventilation (36.4%), and the correct ratio of compression and ventilation (21.9%). Regular courses should be targeted at these specific aspects.
