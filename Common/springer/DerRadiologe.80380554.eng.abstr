Venous varicose are one of the most common diseases in industrial countries today. New surgical strategies, tailored to a patient's specific pattern of venous incompetence require more detailed preoperative imaging. Methods: In this review of current literature we analyzed the value of ascending venography, color coded duplex sonography and descending venography for preoperative planning of varicose surgery. On the other hand, we describe variant anatomy of the superficial venous system like the different levels of escape points and perforating veins.  Results: Ascending venography and color coded duplex sonography are both excellent modalities for detection of reflux in the saphenofemoral and saphenopopliteal junction. The results of current literature indicate, that ascending venography is superior to color coded duplex sonography in the detection of incompetent perforators. Conclusion: Ascending venography and color coded duplex sonography provide improved information, that may be crucial for surgical planning. The high heterogeneity and broad distribution of valvular incompetence confirmes the importance of detailed preoperative imaging.
