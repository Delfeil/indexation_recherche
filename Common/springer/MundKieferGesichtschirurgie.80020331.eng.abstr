Up to now the clinical follow-up in mandibular callus distraction was supported by radiologic methods, although low-mineralized structures are only insufficiently described by X-rays. Mandibular callus distraction was performed on 14 patients suffering from uni- or bilateral mandibular hypoplasia, using either intra- or extraoral devices. The clinical follow-up was supplemented by standardized sonographic investigations. With the exception of postoperative pin placement control, which was done by using X-rays, all interesting items of treatment could be visualized by sonography. We found a reliable correlation between sonographically measured distances and distances measured on the device. Due to early detection of complications, a premature ossification was detected in one case and an infection was diagnosed in another, using ultrasound. Sonography proved to enhance the possibilities of monitoring in mandibular callus distraction treatment and can be recommended in clinical routine.
