Abstract.  Definition of the problem: In the debate on euthanasia descriptive differences as active vs. passive or as intended vs. foreseen are used as an ethically neutral basis for showing that there is a morally significant difference between killing a patient on the one hand and letting him die on the other hand. Based on the doctrine of the sanctity of human life many ethicists hold, that direct active euthanasia is wrong in principle, and that the intention to kill is incompatible with the ethics implicit in the physician's actions. A main source for misunderstandings in the debate is that central terms (as "killing") are used in a descriptive and ethical way simultaneously.
