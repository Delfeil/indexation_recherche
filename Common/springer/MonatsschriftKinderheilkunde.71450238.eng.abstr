X-linked inherited OTC-deficiency is the most frequent inborn error of urea synthesis. Molecular heterogeneity is shown by more than 50 mutations at the OTC-gene locus reflecting a broad clinical spectrum. We report on a normally developed 16 months old girl who never had coma or lethargy but presented with neurological symptoms such as minor ataxia and increased muscular tonus and discrete athetoidal movements of the upper extremities. EEG showed only minor abnormalities, in the MRI of the brain enhanced, frontal and occipital periventricular signal intensities were detectable. Biochemical findings were typical for OTC-deficiency with a moderate hyperammonemia (up to 332 µmol/l), normal basic amino acids in plasma and a high excretion of orotic acid and uracil in urine (735 and 370 mmol/mol creatinine resp.). DNA analysis showed a novel G > T mutation at the intron1/exon1 boundary, which apparently led to an abnormal splicing of the DNA. After introducing a dietary and medical treatment, neurological symptoms disappeared, blood ammonia became normal, MRI changes almost completely disappeared 3 months after therapy was started.  Discussion: This case illustrates that a selective screening for inborn errors of metabolism should also be performed in patients with minor neurological symptoms.
