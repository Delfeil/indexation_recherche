The ovarian steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone exert their effect by interacting with their intracellular receptors, which, after ligand binding translocate to the nucleus and bind to the promoter regions of target genes. The consequence is a change in the transcription rate of the target genes, followed by a change in production of the corresponding proteins. Target genes of the sexual steroid hormoness include cytokines and growth factors, among them CSF-1, TGF- and LIF. The rhythm and activity of steroidogenesis, receptor modulation and transcription are reflected by cycle-specific proliferation and differentiation processes in the endometrium. Quantitative and/or qualitative molecular endocrinology is of increasing interest for better definition of morphological changes, although, as yet, the pathological laboratory test is of much less practical consequence than a suspicious vaginal sonography. In spite of the high standard of ultrasound techniques, however, most cases with slightly increased endometrial thickness show histologically benign changes of the endometrium rather than endometrial precancer or cancer. This is especially true for perimenopausal women with no other clinical findings. Yet, the cancer risk is increased in women under tamoxifen therapy. Hence, as a rule, these cases, when endometrial thickness exceeds 5 mm, need a diagnostic biopsy or abrasio.
