 The prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor. The hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70-90% in patients with solid tumors to 75-90% in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95% in patients after bone marrow transplantation. The number of patients referred to intensive care units is however increasing, due to improvements in the general treatment of malignant diseases. This results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients. Since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified. A reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with vasopressors is necessary and/or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present. For these patients a withdrawal of further life support may be considered. Intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases. For other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making.
