Traditionally, intra-vitam diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of brain supplying arteries is a domain of conventional selective angiography. We are aware of only two publications reporting of ultrasound displayed intimal and medial variants of carotid artery FMD, in one case each. We present a patient in whom color-coded duplex-sonography revealed a web-like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal FMD.
