When studying inflammation and wound healing, peculiar fibroblasts with ultrastructural similarities to smooth muscle cells were described by a group of pathologists associated with Guido Majno (GM) and Giulio Gabbiani (GG), subsequently called myofibroblasts. Similar cells were also found later in human granulation tissue, palmar fibromatosis and in stromal reactions with invasive cancers. Their identification was facilitated by immunohistochemical methods. Some neoplastic cells, for instance in MFH, also revealed characteristics compatible with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are conceived of as modulated fibroblasts. Cytokines may serve as mediators for activation and contractile modification of fibroblasts. In this context monitoring of a tumorlike overproduction of myofibroblasts or an underproduction with non-union of wounds might also be feasible. Moreover, better understanding of the role of myofibroblasts concerning the transition from in situ carcinomas into invasive growth may have therapeutic perspectives. Myofibroblasts apparently not only show a temporary existence in disease, but also can be found under normal conditions in several regions, such as the skin, periodontal ligaments, or pulmonary septa.
