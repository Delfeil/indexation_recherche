  Current demographic trends indicate an increase in average age within the workforce. The "juniorstaff-directed" personnel strategies of companies obviously no longer fit when the number of older workers increase. Based on current research, it is still open in which direction older employees present an obstacle for innovation and which intervention strategies are necessary to promote their ability for innovation. This study particularly indicates the subjective view of older workers regarding various aspects of their current job-situation. Data collection is based on semi-structured interviews with 75 participants (49 men, 26 women, 45 to 55 years old) working in companies of chemical industries in Germany. Results show that older workers have different perceptions of their job situation. One group feels to be "successful and socialintegrated", a second group of older workers "adjusts itself passively to job demands", and a third group is "complaining and not satisfied with the current job situation". Indicators for innovation abilities are "to be able to set goals", "acceptance of challenges" as well as the "acceptance to take over responsibility". In addition aspects of the working conditions and the degree of job-training discriminated between the three groups. The findings point to a close relationship between "innovation capability" of older workers and "stimulating working conditions"; conclusions for personnel strategies can be drawn.
