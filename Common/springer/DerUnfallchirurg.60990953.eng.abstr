For several years it has been argued that a chest tube should be placed at the scene of an accident if thoracic trauma is suspected. However, during emergency treatment in hospital it has been observed that a high number of such tubes have been placed incorrectly. To validate this impression, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical course of 33 trauma victims who had had chest tubes placed at the scene of accident. It was found that 39.4% of the chest tubes were placed completey incorrectly and 21.2% required some correction; 39.4% were placed correctly. In two cases (6.1%) life-threatening complications developed because of the chest tube, necessitating a thoracotomy in 1 patient and repeated pericardial punction in the other. Based on the results of our study we believe that a more critical attitude should be adopted to the placement of chest tubes at the scene of the accident.
