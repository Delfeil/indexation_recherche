Injuries to the spine and the spinal cord are an important problem. In the present paper the application of external transpedicular fixation of the spinal column for surgical treatment of patients in the acute phase of spinal cord injuries is described. The results of treatment obtained in 54 patients in the acute phase are presented. Decompression of the spinal cord can be accomplished by way of a dorsal approach. In this way it is possible to remove the compressing factor in stages. Positive results were achieved in the late phase in 84.22% of patients with acute spinal and spinal cord injuries.
