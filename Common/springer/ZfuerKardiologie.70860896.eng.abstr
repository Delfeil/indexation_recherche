 In 49 patients undergoing slow pathway (SP) ablation for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) the local electrograms of successful and non-successful radiofrequency current abblications taken from the mapping/ablation catheter in the posteroseptal space were retrospektively analyzed with respect to the following parameters: 1) radio of local atrial (A) to local ventricular (V) electrogram amplitude (A/V-ratio), 2) presence of fractionated atrial activity (FAA) or SP potential (SPP), 3) duration of local A electrogram. Ablation sites were classified in 3 groups: group 1: no FAA/SPP, A/V-ratio >= 0.25; group 2: FAA/SPP or A/V-ratio < 0.25; group 3: FAA/SPP and A/V-ratio < 0.25.
