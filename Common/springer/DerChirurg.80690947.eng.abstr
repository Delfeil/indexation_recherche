 Purpose: During the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life (QOL) data regarding surgical treatment. Methods: The present study comments the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery after required Nissen fundoplication of 70 patients. Therefore, the German Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was used to query the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to 1 year. Results: Preoperatively, we found a low general GIQLI score (mean 92.7 points), which increased 6 weeks postoperatively (116.8 points), 3 months (124.8) and 1 year (mean 123.9 points) significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population (122.6 points). Conclusion: It is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required Nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using QOL.
