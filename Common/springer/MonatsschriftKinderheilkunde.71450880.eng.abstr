Recent advances in diagnostic and surgical techniques as well as perioperative management have made it possible to repair congenital cardiac malformations at an early age. Progress in neonatology in general is also significant. Due to anatomical and physiological reasons heart surgery in neonates is still, however, not without serious problems. It is possible that cardiopulmonary adaptation is incomplete, and the number of contractile myocytes has yet to increase. Due to reduced compliance of the neonatal ventricle, the responsiveness to preload and afterload augmentation is also reduced. Pressure overload in neonatal hearts generally induces hyperplasia of myocytes and coronary angiogenesis, whereas in the heart of elder children and adults pressure overload only induces hypertrophy of myocytes without coronary angiogenesis. Therefore repair during the early hyperplastic phase should eliminate damage to the heart and other important organs.
