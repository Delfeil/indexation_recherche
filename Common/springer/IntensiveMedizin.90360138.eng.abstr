 Deep venous thrombosis is a common disease affecting 1-3 of 1000 adults per year. The goals of therapy are preventing pulmonary embolism and thrombus growth, restoring venous outflow tract to avoid postthrombotic syndrome and reducing acute pain. For the first two goals a fast and effective anticoagulation is mandatory, which was mainly achieved with intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin therefore requiring control of aPTT and adjustment of the dosis. The low molecular weight heparins allow an effective anticoagulation by body weight adjusted subcutaneous application. There is some evidence that low molecular weight heparins are superior to unfractionated heparins with regard to thrombus extension, hemorrhages and mortality. The first studies for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis at home are discussed. The long term treatment of venous thromboembolism is performed with oral anticoagulants. The therapeutic range is an INR of 2.0 to 3.0. The duration of oral anticoagulation varies according to etiology, clinical course and risk of recurrence. Thrombolysis or thrombectomy has not been shown to be superior to conservative treatment in long term follow up and should be considered in selected cases.
