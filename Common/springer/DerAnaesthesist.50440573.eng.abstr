Background. Propanidid was widely used as a short-acting i.v. anaesthetic until it was withdrawn due to severe haemodynamic side effects. It was presumed that anaphylactoid reactions with massive histamine release were caused by the solvent cremophor rather than by propanidid itself. A new liposomal preparation of propanidid was examined in this animal study and compared with propanidid in cremophor solution and with propofol.
