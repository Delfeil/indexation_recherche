The most common causes of an 'acute scrotum' in childhood are testicular torsion, torsion of an appendix testis, epididymoorchitis, idiopathic edema, and hematoma. In rare cases a scrotal hematoma can originate from an extra- or intraperitoneal adrenal bleeding. 12 such cases have been described in the literature, yet. We report on 3 further cases, that occured in our institution between 1992 and 1997. In the first case we performed a scrotal exploration due to a suspected testicular torsion, but only a normal testicle and liquid hematoma were seen. Postoperatively we discovered an ipsilateral adrenal hemorrhage by sonography. In the latter two cases the adrenal bleeding was recognized primarily as causal for the scrotal mass and operation remained undone. In newborns adrenal hemorrhage is mostly due to birth-trauma, large birth-weight, hypoxia, and asphyxia. This was present as well with our 3 children. If the clinical situation of the child is stable, complete restitution under conservative therapy can be expected.
