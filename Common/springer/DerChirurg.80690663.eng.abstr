 Thirty-seven patients with chronic sinus pilonidalis were treated after total excision by Dufourmentel flap. We saw seroma complications in three and wound infections in two cases. Patients stayed in hospital 6.3 days on an average and were able to work after 2.5 weeks. The method is easy to use. We have not seen a return to sinus problems in any of this cases.
