Even today metastatic breast cancer remains incurable disease. Therefore most clinical trials in the last decade aimed at an improvement of the therapeutical ratio. In this context high-dose chemotherapy with therapy related mortality of 2 %-5 % seems to be justified only if long term survival or relevant prolongation of progression free survival is attainable. Survival data from early phase I-II trials show the same initial high relapse rates as after conventional chemotherapy. On the contrary, HDC data from the early 80 s suggest that after three years survival plateaus at 14 %-20 % long term survivors. Data from European and American transplant registries reporting about 4000 patients show the same trend. For the whole population the survival advantage by high dose chemotherapy is estimated to be about one year. Maximum benefit is demonstrable in patients with chemosensitive disease. Data from one phase III trial comparing early tandem HDC with conventional chemotherapy show significant survival advantages for the HDC group with 20 % survivors at 400 weeks. Data from other phase III trials will be published in 1999. In Germany patients can be randomized to two ongoing prospective randomized trials.
