 Between 1980 and 1995, 207 patients with 219 extensive pelvic pressure sores underwent reconstructive surgery at our department. Eighty patients operated upon between 1992 and 1995 were followed up. The postoperative complication rate was 22 % and the relapse rate 27 %. Pre- and postoperative management has been standardized for the purposes of quality control. The value of preoperative management, choice of flap, operative procedure and postoperative care are discussed in this paper.
