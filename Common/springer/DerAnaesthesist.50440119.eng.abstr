Case Report. A 31-year-old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction. The patient's preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before. The physical examination - including sonography of the two fetuses - showed no pathological signs. Anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side, using routine precautions pre-oxygenation, and rapid sequence intubation, and was maintained unproblematically. About 20 min after the onset of surgery, hypotension, tachycardia, and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared. Volume substitution and the application of vasoactive drugs failed to stabilise the haemodynamic situation. Elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left tilzing of the operating table did not lead to improvement. The development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction. The patient was treated successfully with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids (prednisolone). The suspicion of latex-related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio-allergen-sorbent test (RAST) and prick and scratch tests.
