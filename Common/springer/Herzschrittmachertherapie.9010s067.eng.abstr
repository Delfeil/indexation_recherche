  The Intermedics Marathon pacemaker uses a mode switch algorithm that allows the pacemaker to maintain AV synchrony during sinus rhythm while preventing ventricular tracking of high atrial rates. This algorithm relies on fulfilling mode switching criteria of run and rate, which are both dependent on the reliable sensing of atrial events. Programming of the pacemaker to allow for reliable atrial sensing will eliminate some of the problems seen with this algorithm.
