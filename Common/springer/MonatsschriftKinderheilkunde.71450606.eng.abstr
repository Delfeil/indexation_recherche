Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II is a life-threatening complication of heparin therapy with venous thrombosis and occlusion of arteries ("white clot syndrome"). So far, in children only a few cases of HIT have been reported. The report on a 12-year-old boy who suffered from venous thrombosis of unknown origin. Thrombolytic therapy included streptokinase, urokinase and unfractionated heparin. He developed thrombocytopenia, thromboembolism of the femoral artery and thrombosis of the vena cava inferior. HIT-antibodies against platelet-factor 4 complex could be demonstrated by ELISA and heparin-induced platelet activation assay. After cessation of heparin anticoagulation was provided with a heparinoid and recombinant hirudin. Thereafter he recovered from venous thrombosis, but amputation of the distal foot at the Chopart line could not be avoided. This case report demonstrates that HIT is not restricted to adults. Furthermore, it strongly suggests that even in paediatric patients regular control of platelet counts are necessary during heparin application.
