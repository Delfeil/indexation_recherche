 Surgical treatment of diffuse peritonitis is applied very variably. There is no question that source control is the most important treatment principle, but the role of additional treatment concepts such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage remains controversial. In a prospective survey (1993-1996) we analyzed the need for additional treatment concepts in our patient material. In 186 patients with diffuse peritonitis we applied the concept of source control and extensive (20-30 l) intraoperative lavage. Additional treatment principles such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage (n = 17) or staged lavage (n = 5) were applied only "on demand", namely in 20 patients (11 %). In 166 patients (89 %) source control of diffuse peritonitis was possible. The mean severity of peritonitis (n = 186) was 28.5 (range 16-43) using the Mannheim Peritonitis Index. The primary cause of peritonitis in our patients was perforation or leakage in the lower GI tract (52 %). The hospital mortality rate was 12 % in the whole group, and the postoperative morbidity rate was 34 %. We conclude that nowadays, using high-quality intensive care as well as modern antiinfective treatment, only a few patients (ca. 10 %) need additional therapy measures such as postoperative lavage. Surgical source control in combination with intraoperative lavage is sufficient in most of the patients with diffuse peritonitis.
