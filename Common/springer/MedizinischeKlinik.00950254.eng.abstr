The human arterial blood pressure shows not only exogenic alterations, but also spontaneous fluctuations. This blood pressure variability has both scientific and clinical relevance. A well-known phenomenon is the so-called "white coat hyptertension" which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension. Furthermore, several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end-organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the circardian blood pressure variability. Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration.
