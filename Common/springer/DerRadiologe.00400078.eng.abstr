The aim of the paper is to present the conceptual basis and capabilities of intranet applications in radiology. The intranet, which is the local brother of the internet can be readily realized using existing computer components and a network. All current computer operating systems support intranet applications which allow hard and software independent communication of text, images, video and sound with the use of browser software without dedicated programs on the individual personal computers. Radiological applications for text communication e.g. department specific bulletin boards and access to examination protocols; use of image communication for viewing and limited processing and documentation of radiological images can be achieved on decentralized PCs as well as speech communication for dictation, distribution of dictation and speech recognition.
