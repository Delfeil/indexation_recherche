 The incidence of coronary artery aneurysm varies in the range from 0.2% to 4.9%. Ninety per cent of these were associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, where vessel ectasia and poststenotic dilatations are not an infrequent finding. We present the case of a 67 year old patient with coronary artery aneurysm and coexisting coronary artery disease of the right coronary artery. The patient was symptomatic and had a posterolateral myocardial infarction. We performed a PTCA and stent-implantation of the stenosis and coronary artery aneurysm of the right coronary artery. After the procedure, the patient could be discharged without angina pectoris. A control-angiography will be performed six months later.
