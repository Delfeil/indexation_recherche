We report on unusual presentation forms of Pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with AIDS. A 36-years-old woman presented a cavitation in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x-ray. The biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on. The surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells, focal recent and older hemorrhages, rests of fibrinous exudate and dystrophic calcifications. In the surrounding tissue there were Pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls, this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change. A cytomegalic virus infection was also found.
