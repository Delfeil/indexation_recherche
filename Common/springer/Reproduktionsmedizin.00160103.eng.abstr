Many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years, and some have already found their way into clinical routine. Cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment. However, the short-term culture of oocytes before metaphase II does seem relevant. Blastocyst culture has mostly replaced coculture techniques and, given appropriate laws, provides adequate possibility of selecting embryos with high developmental and implantation potential. An exact pronuclear diagnosis also has a high ability to predict the probability of implantation. Viewing the latest data, assisted hatching seems to bring no improvements for most patients. Preimplantation diagnosis is being discussed in Germany due to new statements from ethical committees. Cytoplasma transfer, nuclear transfer, or the transplantation of spermatogenic cells into donors are currently only experimental.
