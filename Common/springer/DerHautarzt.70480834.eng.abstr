Paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease. While some disorders almost invariably herald an underlying malignancy (obligative marker), most only occasionally do so (facultative marker). The association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial. There are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma. We diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a 74 year old female patient, admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid. Multiple metastases were found in her lymph nodes, liver, lung and skeleton. The patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared.
