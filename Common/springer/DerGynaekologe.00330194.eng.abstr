The dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his/her facility: admission, diagnosis, treatment, transfer, and discharge of patients. However, in developing such general hospital information systems, one runs into the following problems: (1) medical and administrative information systems form a very heterogeneous environment; (2) the structure of medical information is extremely complex, except for certain limited administrative data (admission, transfer, and discharge, for example) needed by the clinic administration. As a result it is nearly impossible to transfer medical information from one system to another without a loss of data. One cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years. Therefore we present a concept which, based on existing tools, allows communication between medical information systems.
