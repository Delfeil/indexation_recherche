Patients who were operated on because of an isolated trauma to the knee meniscus experienced instability of the knee joint concerned more frequently than age-matched controls. Patients who underwent knee surgery also experienced pain and swelling of the knee joint more frequently than controls Those patients who had arthroscopic procedures had fewer symptoms than patients undergoing open procedures. Both groups experienced increasing instability after 10 years. Early diagnosis and therapy is indicated in patients with persisting post-traumatic knee joint symptoms. Of the patients undergoing open meniscus operations, patients with bucket-handle tears complained more frequently about a feeling of instability than those with other lesions. This was not the case if the procedure was performed by arthroscopy. Patients who were noted to have chondropathy at the initial open procedure had more frequent symptoms of pain and were less satisfied with the procedure than patients without chondral disease. This was not evident after arthroscopic procedures. After nonarthroscopic procedures, a larger percentage of patients reduced their sporting activities.
