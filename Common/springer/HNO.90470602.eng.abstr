Background: Specific immunotherapy (SIT) of allergic disorders as introduced by Freeman and Noon involves the application of gradually increasing doses of extracts of the material to which the individual is sensitive. SIT represents the only specific treatment that can be offered to allergic patients besides allergen avoidance. SIT has been widely used in patients with pollen allergic rhinitis and its clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in several controlled clinical trials. The underlying mechanism of this treatment is still not understood. Previous studies have focused on changes in serum antibodies, including blunting of seasonal rises in specific IgE and increases in specific IgG antibodies, especially of the IgG4 isotype. Recent studies have suggested an effect on T-lymphocytes, leading to a switch from a predominant Th2 response - that is, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 - to a Th1 response involving interferon (IFN)-. The switch of a cytokine profile to a predominant IFN- response results in inhibition of IL-4 dependent IgE production, which is reinforced by a decrease in the production of IL-4 by Th2 cells.
