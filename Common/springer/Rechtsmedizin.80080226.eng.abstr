 A 34-year-old woman who was separated from her husband, was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest. The post-mortem examination was carried out approximately 5 h after death. At the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken. Additionally, a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her polo-neck pullover. It was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a fabric pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim. DNA typing (short tandem repeat-PCR) of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect.
