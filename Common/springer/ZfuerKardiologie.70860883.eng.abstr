 A prospective study was performed of the correlation of ventricular late potentials (LP) and clinical parameters in patients after acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate the prognostic significance of the signalaveraged-electrocardiogram (SAECG) in risk stratification of sudden cardiac death and arrhythmogenic events, the clinical characteristics of these postinfarction patients were performed in a follow-up-period.
