We report on an 8 year old boy and a 12 year old girl with intermittent peranal loss of blood and mucus, impaired defecation and recurrent abdominal pain. On endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only, whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically. Biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae. These clinical, endoscopical and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. Only 26 paediatric cases (age at diagnosis 6-9 years) have been published so far. The interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis (mean: 3,7 years, range: 1 week to 9 years) is remarkably long in childhood cases. Pathogenetically an internal rectal prolapse with secondary ischemic lesions is assumed. There is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease. The ulcers ars often resistant to different medical and surgical options. Discussion: Pediatricians should be aware of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in order to make an earlier diagnosis and to prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and concerns of patients and their parents about more severe illnesses.
