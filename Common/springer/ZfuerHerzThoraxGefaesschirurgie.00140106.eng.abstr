 The operative and anesthetic risk of patients suffering from sleep apnoea syndrome is generally considered to be elevated because of frequent concomitant disease such as obesity and hypertension and side effects of sedative, anesthetic and analgesic agents. Cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation leads to lung edema and may therefore aggravate complications of the respiratory tract. We performed this study to verify, if the operative and anesthetic risk of patients, suffering from sleep apnoea syndrome and undergoing cardiac surgery, is really elevated.    Between September 1994 and December 1996 ten male patients suffering from sleep apnoea syndrome underwent aortocoronary bypass grafting with extracorporeal circulation. Preoperatively we analyzed symptomatology, predisposing factors, concomitant diseases and medication. Perioperatively we were interested in respiratory and hemodynamic function, anesthetic management and complications beside the common operative parameters.    All patients were obese and four patients were treated medically for hypertension. The anesthetic management was the same as used in other routine cardiac patients. Neither induction of anesthesia nor weaning from the respirator led to respiratory complications. Postoperatively we had to implant an intraaortic balloon counterpulsation in two patients because of left ventricular dysfunction in order to stabilize hemodynamics. We removed it in both patients without complications on the second postoperative day after catecholamine therapy had been stopped.    Patients suffering from sleep apnoea syndrome are not at increased risk for respiratory and hemodynamic complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation.
