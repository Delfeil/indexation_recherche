Abstract.  Profilometry is a novel procedure allowing precise analysis of skin surface structure. With the help of a synthetic material a negative image of a defined area of the skin is taken. During the subsequent analytical procedure the roughness is determined by means of a profilometer. A commercially available statistics software program is used for statistical analysis of the results. This procedure was applied to check for to evaluate positive effects of oestrogen creams on the structure of the skin surface on the face.
