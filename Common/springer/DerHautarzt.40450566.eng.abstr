Abstract.  A case of a 37-year-old woman with symmetrical bilateral apocrine hidrocystomas at the lateral margins of the eyelids is presented. The symmetrical, simultaneous and bilateral appearance of the lesions, the lack of association with other abnormalities and the absence of the lesion in the family history make this case remarkable.
