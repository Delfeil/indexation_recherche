Abstract.  We report on a 41-year-old patient who developed extensive chronic sclerodermatous graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) subsequent to an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from his HLA-identical sister. Chronic GvHD is to be expected in 30% of bone marrow transplantations. It is a serious multisystem disorder which leads to a polymorphic clinical picture with lichenoid or sclerodermatous skin changes. It may also affect nails, hair and mucous membranes. In the absence of causal therapy GvHD should be managed with symptomatic local treatment and systemic immunosuppression.
