 The design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task. In particular in ICD trials, false estimations and omissions have occured that can compromise the interpretation of a trial.  Identification of crucial issues that should be regulated in a study protocol in order to minimize the risk of failure.  Evaluation of the weaknesses of completed antiarrhythmic trials.  Problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs. Further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared. Technical mistakes as imprecise definitions, arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial, unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol.  A prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is drafted is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial.
