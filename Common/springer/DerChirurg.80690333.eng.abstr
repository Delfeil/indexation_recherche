 The microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue, and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell. Modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high-resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer-assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock-out gene technology. These advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, and transplantation.
