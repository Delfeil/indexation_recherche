 After correct operation varicose veins do not really recur. A recurrence is seen when a disease reappears at the same location after it has been cured. In this sense, the correct exclusion of the primary recirculation circuit results in the healing of this disease. If a secondary popliteal and femoral insufficiency has developed already surgical treatment was undertaken too late. The operation improves the conditions of the blood flow in the deep venous system, but whether the condition will normalize depends on different factors. The lesions of the deep veins with antegrade or retrograde insufficiency of the blood flow are responsible for the development of different varicose veins. Therefore the patient has to be treated life long. In special cases valve reconstruction may be possible. Very important are compressive therapy with stockings and bandages, balneotherapy and exercise treatment.
