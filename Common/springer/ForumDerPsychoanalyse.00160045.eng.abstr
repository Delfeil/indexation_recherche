The personality organisation and the process of therapy of drug-addicted patients are examined by the comparative analysis of 15 single cases. The antisocial tendency is emphasised as the main clinical feature. It is related to specific genetic traumata and the externalisation of parts of the superego. During the therapeutical process, the antisocial tendency destroys the therapeutical relation. If it is possible to continue therapy beyond this point, the patients can now enter into a process, in which new identifications and the integration of parts of the superego are involved. Approaching the end of the therapy, patients, again, tend to destroy the results of therapy if one does not consider specific problems of the separation process.
