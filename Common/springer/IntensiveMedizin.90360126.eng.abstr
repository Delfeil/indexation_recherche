 In absence of significant symptoms and signs, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains difficult. Sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and ECG on their own is low. Echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload. Venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected PE, but normal results do not rule out PE. Helical CT with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli. However, if the CT findings are normal in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion, only larger pulmonary embolism are ruled out, and angiography with the focus on distal pulmonary vasculature should be performed. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment, several diagnostic techniques, and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases. Heparin remains the standard therapy for patients with stable hemodynamics. Thrombolytic therapy is recommended in hemodynamically compromised patients. In short-term dose regimes, the thrombolytic agents urokinase, streptokinase, and rt-PA seem to be equally efficient. So far, however, no study has proven that thrombolytic therapy significantly reduces mortality in pulmonary embolism.
