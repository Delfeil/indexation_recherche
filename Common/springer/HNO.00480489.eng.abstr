Nitric oxide (NO) can play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission, as well as in non-specific immunoreactions and inflammation in a variety of tissues. Increased quantities of nitric oxide in respired air can be measured during inflammatory processes. However, the exact role and precise sources of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions within the airways remain to be defined.
