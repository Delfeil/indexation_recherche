The realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients, but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients. The global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems; stepwise mastering of these problems may help to maintain or restore an acceptably high quality of life according to the WHO guidelines for palliative medicine. In light of the anxiety felt by physicians and others caring for this patient group, palliative psycho-oncology must offer patient-centered holistic care in which the psycho-oncologist is not an isolated therapist but rather a member of a team made up of physicians, nurses, religious workers, psychologists, ergotherpists, physiotherapists, social workers, and especially family members. Together, this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed.
