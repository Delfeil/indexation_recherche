Background: Propionibacterium acnes has been described as a causative agent of postoperative endophthalmitis. This gram-positive, immotile, non-spore-forming bacterium is highly pleomorphic and grows under conditions of low to no oxygen concentration. It is commonly found on the skin at the openings of sebaceous glands and on hairs. A near-symptomless postoperative endophthalmitis occurs particularly when Propionibacteria are enclosed in the capsular bag. We investigated to what extent the number of P. acnes in the conjunctival sac can be reduced by preoperative disinfection with polyvidone iodine (1 %).
