We report a patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) with a first manifestation of homicide. On admission the patient showed a hebephrenia-like syndrom with inappropriate affect, thought disorder and  behavioral changes. Magnetic resonance  tomography (MRT) findings suggested a  diagnosis of MLD, which was confirmed by a decreased activity of leucocyte arylsulfatase A and an excessive urinary sulfatide excretion.
