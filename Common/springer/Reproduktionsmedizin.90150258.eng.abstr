It involves an understanding of the structure as well as of the philosophy of reproductive technologies. First, the experiences which people unwillingly childless make when undergoing technological interventions have to be taken into consideration. Second, the implications which reproductive technologies have on people concerned as well as on society are further important points to be considered by moral reasoning. It is essential to clarify the perspectives which we have on reproductive technologies as well as on "natural" reproduction. Points to consider in ethical debates should be: The constructed polarity and assumed contradiction between natural and artificial, our concepts of (human) nature and our anthropological assumptions which influence the reasoning about reproductive medicine, the technological imperative (in terms of persuasiveness by the perfection of technologies) by which is meant that we should do what we can do, the shifting in value-orientation with concentration on an intensive desire for a child influencing further decisions at the cost of considerations about the future wellbeing of the child to be. The possible splitting of parenthood as well as the tendencies of postponing parenthood to older ages are examples which require value research and moral examination of consequences of blind application of technologies without moral reasoning implications. Ethical counselling for people concerned and open debate in society about shared values and technologically implied problems should lead to transparency and responsible decision-making sometimes implying the setting of moral limitations.
