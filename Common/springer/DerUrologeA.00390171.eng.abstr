Glans penis leiomyomas are uncommon as primary nonepithelial tumors of the urogenital tract. Only 4 cases are described until today. We saw an other case of an 12 years old boy with a leiomyoma of the glans penis. Clinically the lesion presented as a yellow induration with no symptoms as pain, pruritus or bleeding. The biopsy revealed histological a leiomyoma in the subcutis of the glans penis with no symptoms of malignancy. Because of suspected functional and cosmetic deficiency a total resection was not performed. None of the cases described in the literature showed in the follow up malignancy or recurrency. 18 months postoperatively our patient is furthermore well and without symptoms. Nevertheless the leiomyoma of that localization is rare, this tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of the neoplasms of the glans penis.
