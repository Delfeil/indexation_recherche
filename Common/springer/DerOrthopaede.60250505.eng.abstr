In analysis of the cervical and cervicobrachial syndrome with or without signs of compression of the nerve root or spinal cord, functional assessment of the cervical spine is of great importance. Comparisons between actively performed and passively induced motion can be verified by using standardized computer-assisted assessment allowing precise documentation of the range of motion and coupled motion. The age-related normal values should be considered. The neurological assessment includes not only the cranial nerves and upper extremities but also lower extremities to avoid overlooking the signs of cervical myelopathy. In patients with compression of nerve roots or the spinal cord neurophysiology might be helpful in identifying or verifying compression. In patients with suspected myelopathy sensory evoked potentials will allow assessment of the function of the ascending spinal pathways and motor evoked potentials, assessment of the function of the descending cortical spinal pathways.
