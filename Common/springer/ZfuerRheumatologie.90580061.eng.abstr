 Involvement of the sacroiliac joints is a hallmark of the spondyloarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis. The conventional diagnostic imaging of sacroiliitis in early stages might cause problems, because sensitivity of conventional radiographic methods is known to be too low in early stages of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints certainly enables one to detect acute as well as chronic inflammatory changes in all stages of the disease. The potential disadvantages of this method are the dependency on the examiner, the lack of standardization, and the relatively high costs. Therefore, the "Workgroup of Diagnostic Imaging in Rheumatology of the Regional Center of Rheumatology of Berlin" including experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists, and orthopedists acquired an imaging graduation for detection of sacroiliitis in consideration of the clinical background, the technical details of the methods, questions of ionizing radiation exposure, and cost effectiveness.
