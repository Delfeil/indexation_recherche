The literature concerning self-harming behaviour involves mostly single case studies. The few empiric studies rely on relatively few cases. The absence of a unitary nomenclature and of a uniform model of documentation makes the comparison of the diverse results of investigation difficult. The present basic model of documentation enables clinicians and investigators - independent of their psychopathological and psychotherapeutical orientation - to comprehend basic data and to classify them systematically. Hereby, the exchange between clinicians who are confronted with self-harming patients is improved and possibilities for multicentre studies created.
