Multiple personality is known since last century und has been described by Breuer and Freud as well as by Kraepelin. In the latest and nearly exclusively angloamerican literature multiple personality disorder is included in the dissociated reactions in borderline personality disorder. The concept of comorbidity is criticized. Case studies illustrate indications for diagnosing MPD. The authors point out, that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing. But their development has its limits: In most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic "investigation" can be on a psychodynamic level a repetition of traumatic abuse.
