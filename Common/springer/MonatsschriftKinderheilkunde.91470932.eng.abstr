Nager-syndrome is characterized by mandibulofacial dysostosis and radial defects. Due to the backwards displacement of the tongue hypoplasia of the mandible may cause an upper airway obstruction. Our patient suffered from dyspnea after birth and received nasal CPAP and sedatives over her first 5 months of life. Subsequently extension therapy was started, followed by early distraction osteogenesis of the mandible. The result was functionally and cosmetically satisfactory. Obstructive apneas and dyspnea had completely disappeared at the end of therapy.
