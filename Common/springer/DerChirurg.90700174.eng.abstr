 The experience with laterolateral cavocavostomy for hepatovenous reconstruction in liver transplantation is reviewed with and without the use of a temporary portocaval shunt. A total of 65 liver transplantations were analyzed. In 49 transplantations a laterolateral cavocaval anastomosis was performed (group I). In group II (n = 16) the same technique was used after a temporary portal caval shunt was constructed. Mean arterial pressure (mmHg): group I 128  +/-  34; group II 109  +/-  32. Cardiac output (l/min) decrease during the anhepatic phase was 2.3  +/-  1.9 and 1.2  +/-  1.5, respectively (P < 0.05). The peroperative blood loss measured as the number of packed cells transfused was 16.4  +/-  15.8 versus 1.2  +/-  2.3 (P < 0.04) and fresh frozen plasma 19.0  +/-  14.7 versus 3.7  +/-  4.0 (P < 0.02). Course on ICU (days), liver function tests, renal function and the need for reoperation because of bleeding were not statistically significantly different between the groups. One-year patient survival was 82.7 and 85.7 %, respectively. In conclusion, we found that despite preservation of the caval flow during hepatectomy, the additional use of a temporary portocaval shunt was advantageous with regard to peroperative hemorrhage and hemodynamic stability and can potentially facilitate implantation of the liver graft.
