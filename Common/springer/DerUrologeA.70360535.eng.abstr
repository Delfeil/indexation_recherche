Urodynamic examinations were performed in 82 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before and after radical prostatectomy. A significant decrease in bladder capacity (396 ml to 331.9 ml), urethral closure pressure (89.6 cm H2O to 65.,2 cm H2O) and functional profile length (61 mm to 25.9 mm) was noted. The continence rate after radical prostatectomy was 33.4 % after 1 month, 69.4 % after 3 months, 84.7 % after 6 months, and 90.9 % after 12 months, respectively. A correlation was found between urethral closure pressure and functional profile length and continence. A second urodynamic examination was performed 6 months after radical prostatectomy. Functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased. These data suggest that restoration of continence is based on sphincteric parameters.
