31Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) has gained much interest in schizophrenia research in the last years, since it allows noninvasive measurement of high energy phosphates and phospholipids of the human brain in vivo. Thus, several studies have reported cerebral metabolic differences between patients and healthy controls as well as on lateralization effects and influences of epidemiological and psychopathological factors. This review gives a survey of the potential of 31P-MRS in schizophrenia research and summarizes and comments on the results of preceding studies. The discussion covers the reduction of phospholipids in patients in the context of the membrane phospholipid hypotheses, the question of an energetic hypometabolism in schizophrenics, and the influence of neuroleptic medication.
