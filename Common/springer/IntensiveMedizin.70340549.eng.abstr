 Purpose: Echocardiog-raphy is often used as a diagnostic tool in critically ill patients in intensive care units. We performed this prospective study to assess the general value of this technique in patients on a medical intensive care unit. Patients: 118 patients (68 men, 50 women, age 53 +/- 13 years) were echocardiographically investigated because of an uncertain diagnosis or hemodynamic situation. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in 55% of our patients, transesophageal echocardiography in 45% and both in 21%. Transesophageal echocardiography was always indicated in patients with suspected endocarditis, aortic dissection or embolic events. Methods: For the investigations an electronic sector scanner was used (mainly Aloka SSD 2200), the transesophageal echocardiographic transducer was a multiplane probe. Results: In 38% of patients a new main diagnosis was established or the suspected diagnosis could be more precisely defined. In 5% the echocardiographic investigation was life saving because of the initiated management. In 20% the echocardiography revealed no further information regarding the patients hemodynamics. In 6% the echocardiographic investigation led to a wrong diagnosis. In most of these cases the subsequent investigation revealed the true diagnosis (e. g. virusmyocarditis). No major complications occurred. Conclusion: Echocardiography is diagnostically helpful in many and lifesaving in some patients. Thus, training in both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography should be part of teaching programs for residents in medical intensive care.
