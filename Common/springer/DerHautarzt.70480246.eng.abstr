We report on two patients with granulomatous rosacea and another patient with granulomatous perioral dermatitis who responded well to dapsone. Dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug. Before the introduction of isotretinoin, dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne. To date, its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described. When hematologic parameters are monitored, dapsone is considered a safe and cost-effective drug, especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available. However, the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study.
