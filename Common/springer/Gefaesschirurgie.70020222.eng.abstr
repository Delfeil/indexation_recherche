 This report describes the method of endoscopic subfascial dissection of perforating veins (SEPS) and the combination of this method with endoscopic fasciotomy. Based on the results of a retrospective study (140 legs, 1983 - 1984) and a prospective study (56 legs, 1987 - 1989) the instruments have been developed in an optimal manner and the strategy of treatment has been standardized. The two major advantages are that precise preoperative localization of the individual perforating veins can be dispensed with and that the method can also be applied to an florid venous ulcer without the massive healing problems otherwise to be expected. The method is basically not indicated in cases of widespread and deep-seated necrosis and extended fasciitis, especially if ankylosis of the ankle is also present. For all other cases of advanced chronic venous insufficiency with (multiple) incompetent perforating veins and trophic disturbances including ulcus cruris, however, ESDP, possibly in combination with endoscopic fasciotomy, is the method of choice.
