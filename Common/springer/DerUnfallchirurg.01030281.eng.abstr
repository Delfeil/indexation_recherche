A total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months (12-98). Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively. According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting. The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program. All fractures in the conservative group were of type A.
