Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) is a T-cell-mediated disease expressing high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the retina. HEVs could be responsable for the absorption of activated T-cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the kinetics of HEV expression in the murine IRBP (interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein) induced EAU.
