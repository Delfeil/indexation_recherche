The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence, etiology and prognosis of severe connatal anemia in preterm and term children. All neonates born in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University of Kiel, were included. In 18 of 18 367 (0.98 permil) liveborn neonates (birth weight 680-4050 g; 26-41 weeks of gestation), the initial hemoglobin level was below 10 g/dl. In those children with birth weight below 2500 g the incidence was 6.8 permil. In 17 of 18 cases the cause of anemia could be clarified. In five preterm babies (28%) an acute fetofetal transfusion and in three newborns a fetomaternal transfusion was responsible for the onset of anemia. In two cases there was Rh incompatibility, in two cases placental bleeding, and in another two cases fetal tumour bleeding caused the anemia. In one fully developed newborn there was severe disseminated intestinal bleeding of unknown cause. Another child suffered from EBV infection, and one had trisomy 13 with multiple malformations. Ten children (55%) had to be resuscitated due to hypovolemic shock. Fifteen children were intubated and ventilated mechanically. Seven children (39%); (six preterm babies and the newborn with trisomy 13) died between days 1 and 6. Five of these seven children had to be resuscitated at birth. Six children (33%) showed evidence of neurologic disease when discharged; five of these were resuscitated previously. Five children (28%) including three full-term babies were developed normally. In conclusion, severe anemia with hemoglobin below 10 g/dl is very rare but serious. It seems necessary to optimize primary resuscitation by immediate transfusion and monitoring of central venous pressure by umbilical vein catheter. The prognosis can be influenced in a positive way.
