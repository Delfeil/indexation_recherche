 We report the case of a 43-year-old woman who had a cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior myocardial infarction. Her husband and a general practitioner living in the neighborhood initially performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A prehospital emergency physician found ventricular fibrillation when he arrived after 20 minutes. It was impossible to achieve stable rhythm by 42 attemps of defibrillation. Therefore, the patient was carried to our clinic under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A cardiologist was informed with radio signal. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (pCPS) was implanted in the emergency department after 100 minutes of cardiac arrest. After stabilizing the hemodynamic situation by pCPS (4-5 l/min) it was possible to transfer the patient to the catheterization laboratory. Angiography revealed proximal occlusion of a dominant right coronary artery. After successful angioplasty it was possible to reestablish stable sinus rhythm by single defibrillation. By use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) the flow rate of pCPS was reduced every two hours. After 10 hours of support pCPS was explaned. IABP was needed for three days. The patient was discharged from hospital without any relevant neurological deficits after nine weeks. By using pCPS it is possible to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice. The use of pCPS in resuscitation is indicated in circulatory arrest if further therapeutic options seem promising.
