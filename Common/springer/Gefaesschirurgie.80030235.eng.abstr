 Diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100% certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography. A correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner. Both methods are available throughout Germany. Although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations, duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive. Phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified. This applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered, if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined. Discrepancy between clinical findings and the results of duplex sonography also constitutes an important indication for phlebography. In many institutions, both methods are used in a "golden partnership" in cases in which it is important to obtain comprehensive records.
