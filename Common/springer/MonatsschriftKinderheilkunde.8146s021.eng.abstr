Background: The domination of the intestinal microflora of infants by bifidobacteria, induced by feeding with mother's milk, is a unique natural phenomenon. There is evidence that breast-fed babies profit from the colonization of their large intestine by these bacteria in many respects. For this reason, following the discovery of bifidobacteria by Tissier in 1900 numerous attempts were made to reproduce the bifidogenic effects in infant feeding formulas. Low puffer capacity, low protein and iron concentration, high lactose content, modified lactose, and numerous other bifidogenic factors were claimed to be responsible for bifidogenic effects similar to those produced by mother's milk. To date, there is no convincing concept for the production of such a formula. The main weaknesses in the evaluation previous studies lie in the incorrect interpretation of the number of bifidobacteria in the faeces in comparison to the remaining species, and in their focus on a single component, neglecting the interaction of all the components.
