Objective: Concerning the long-term somatic development of children born with very low birth weight and/or born very premature, there are varying and sometimes contradictory statements. A follow-up study was carried out on premature-born children from Thuringia and Saxonia at pre-school and early school age in order to investigate the long-term somatic development of these children. Anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group.
