We present a splint system for a protected mobilization program after closed reduction of articular proximal phalangeal base fractures. This therapy consists of the periarticular soft tissue and functional anatomy. The soft-tissue around the base of the proximal phalanx leads to a circular stabilization effect. This so called Zancolli Complex (Metacarpophalangeal Retention Apparatus) can be used with the effect of a brace treatment. Treating 31 patients with articular fractures of the proximal phalanx way we found good functional results within a mean follow up period of 2 years after the accident.
