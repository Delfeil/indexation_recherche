Brain metastases develop as a late manifestation of renal cell cancer (RCC) and pose an increasing challenge to urologists as a result of the more frequent prolonged survival of patients with advanced RCC. Therapeutic options, including surgical resection and radiotherapy, were analyzed retrospectively to assess survival and to identify factors influencing prognosis in a group of 90 patients treated either by brain metastasectomy (n = 64) or radiotherapy (n = 26). The analysis confirmed that the overall median survival was a disappointing 461 days and the 1-year survival rate was 31 % for patients treated by surgical resection and 310 days and 15 % respectively for patients treated by radiotherapy. However, a subgroup of patients who benefitted significantly from aggressive treatment of metastases could be defined. The following favorable prognostic factors showed a trend toward improved survival: (1) metachronous appearance of brain metastases more than 1 year after nephrectomy (P < 0.0001), (2) good patient performance (Karnofsky > 70) (P < 0.0002), (3) patient's age under 50 years (P < 0.05), (4) solitary lesions (P < 0.05), (5) minimal or no neurological deficit (P < 0.05), and (6) the absence of/or minimal extracranial metastases (P < 0.05). No influence of lesion size and localization (infratentorial vs supratentorial) on survival was detected. Surgical treatment of recurrent brain tumors (n = 17) yielded an additional median survival advantage of 8 months as compared to untreated patients (n = 16). Our results suggest that, especially in patients with good prognostic criteria, a radical metastasectomy plus vigorous surgery of local recurrences and, if required, subsequent systemic immuno- or chemoimmunotherapy should be performed. In patients with poor prognosis, stereotactic radiosurgery is recommended for palliation and survival prolongation.
