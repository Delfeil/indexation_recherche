 This paper considers the current relationship between psychoanalysis and neuroscience. In the first part, which is published here, the significance of Freud's early contributions to the dynamic school of behavioural neurology is discussed. It is demonstrated that Freud, who firstly worked as a neurologist, took over from neurology the method of clinical-anatomical correlations, but he refused the crucial basic assumption of neurosciences of his time that the physiological correlates of complex dynamic processes are to be found in certain anatomical centers of the brain. Transferring that assumption to psychopathology, Freud inaugurated the development of psychoanalysis, but also laid the basis for the following divergence between psychoanalysis and neuroscience.
