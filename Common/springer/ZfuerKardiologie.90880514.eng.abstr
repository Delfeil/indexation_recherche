  Interventional duct occlusion is increasingly performed with detachable coils. In a series of 33 patients (34 procedures), we consistently used Gianturco-coils which were the initially employed coils. They are not securable but can be implanted in a simple manner. The rate of embolization was high (28 %) in the first 14 procedures; however, it declined to 5 % in the last 20 patients. We modified the technique by partially blocking the duct, when necessary, with a catheter which was advanced from the pulmonary artery and by implanting up to three coils. There was only one embolization and one small residual shunt in the last 20 patients. The mean fluoroscopy time in these patients was 11.0  +/-  5.8 minutes and decreased to 7.0  +/-  3.2 minutes in the last 10 patients with successful closure. Considering our experience, we continue to recommend the use of Gianturco-coils especially in the small duct which can be closed quickliy at low cost.
