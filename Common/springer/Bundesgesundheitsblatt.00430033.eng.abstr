Recently, there has been intensive research on the use of electromagnetic waves and high pressure for the treatment of food with the aim of minimal processing. The methodological approach is, on the one hand, to achieve a rapid heating of the product by avoiding high temperature gradients which is possible e.g. by using microwaves under appropiate conditions. On the other hand, attempts are made to use so-called non-thermal effects which can be obtained e.g. by using high electric fields pulses or high hydrostatic pressure. It is obvious that the stage of development of the respective procedures is different and that further information is needed conserning safety of the treated food, in particular of that treated with non-thermal procedures. Moreover, the mechanisms of action requires further elucidation.
