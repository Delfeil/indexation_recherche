 Acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure, acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. While decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated. Cardiogenic shock, however is still a therapeutic challenge. For therapy of cardiogenic shock positive inotropes, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use. If it is not possible to correct underlying diseases, mortality of cardiogenic shock is still high.
