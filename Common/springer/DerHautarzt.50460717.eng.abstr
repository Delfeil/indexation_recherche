We report on dermatomyositis-like adverse cutaneous reactions following long-term maintenance therapy with hydroxyurea in two patients suffering from chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). In addition to non-specific side effects, such as xerosis, pruritus and hyperpigmentation, both patients presented with more specific skin changes, i.e. erythematous lesions, scaling, and partially atrophic areas distributed in a linear fashion on the dorsal aspects of the hands and fingers. In addition, teleangiectatic erythema of the face was present in both patients, and this was associated with oedema of the eyelids in one patient. Despite these dermatomyositis-like features there were no clinical signs of muscular involvement, and muscle-specific enzymes were within normal ranges. Skin biopsy specimens revealed an interface dermatitis characterized by a lichenoid cell infiltrate, vacuolar alteration of basal cells, necrotic keratinocytes within the spinous zone, focal hypergranulosis, orthohyperkeratosis and telangiectases in the upper part of the dermis. Analogous histopathological findings have been documented in lichen planus-like skin changes on the hands following hydroxyurea therapy. It seems doubtful whether there are actually any major differences between those skin changes described as dermatomyositis-like and those interpreted as lichen planus-like in patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea therapy.
