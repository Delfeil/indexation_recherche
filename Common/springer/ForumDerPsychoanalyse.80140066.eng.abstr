 Acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting-out. Subtile behaviour, too, as a part of the "complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals" (Sandler) which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting-out or microacting-out (Treuniet). However, this delicate acting has no meaning, it is not symbolic or communicative action. It is aimed at inducing effects and interactions. It appears both on the side of the analyst and of the patient and is part of the unconscious communication in the therapeutic process. Diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated, how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way. The acting-reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations, by which he unintentionally demonstrates, in what a way he understands the patient.
