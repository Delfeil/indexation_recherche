The objectives of the present study were to compare in a randomized double-blind crossover study design the concentration-effect relationships of Ro 48-6791, a new benzodiazepine agonist, and midazolam, following infusion in young and elderly male volunteers. Therefore, linearly increasing plasma concentrations were generated by computer controlled infusion pumps to achieve a deep hypnotic effect. The endpoint of the infusion was defined by loss of response to loud verbal commands and a median frequency of the recorded EEG power spectrum below 4 Hz. Arterial blood samples were collected in regular intervals up to 6 hours after cessation of the infusion. The method of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was used to quantify the concentration-effect relationship, including age related differences, already in this early phase I study. The total clearance of Ro 48-6791 was found to be 1410 +/- 380 vs. 399 +/- 91 ml min-1 for midazolam (mean +/- SD; P<0.005) and the central volume of distribution to be 20.5 +/- 7.1 vs. 7.9 +/- 3.0 l, respectively (P<0.005). The comparison between young and elderly volunteers yielded for Ro 48-6791 a statistically not significant reduction of 16% for clearance with age and a slowed distribution of 47% for midazolam (P<0.05). The recovery period for Ro 48-6791 was reduced by 66% (P<0.005) in the young and 45% (P<0.01) in the elderly, respectively, in comparison with midazolam. With respect to the total doses administered, Ro 48-6791 appeared to be 2.5 times as potent as midazolam in all volunteers (P<0.001). Comparing both age groups, the doses necessary to cause similar effects were reduced by one half for both compounds in the elderly (P<0.001). The major advantages of Ro 48-6791 compared to midazolam were its shorter duration of action as well as the faster recovery and thus the better controllability. Further investigations would have to confirm these results in a greater number of patients. The applied method of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling not only allowed to quantify the efficacy of Ro 48-6791 but also provided data to augment the safety for further investigations.
