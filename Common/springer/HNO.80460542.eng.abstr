The clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in combina-tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast- enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma. We report our findings in a 57-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma. A large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits. Both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate manifestationes of a lymphoma. The development of a progressive facial palsy within 8 weeks of presentation and an atypi-cal occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma. Such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car-dinal symptoms require further diagnostic measures. Manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare. To our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome has never been reported before.
