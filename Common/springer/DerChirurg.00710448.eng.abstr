Abstract.  Morbid obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m2) is a risk factor for cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, neoplastic, and psychologic sequelae. In the present prospective clinical study 65 patients (11 men, 54 women) underwent vertical banded gastroplasty (Mason procedure) from June 1994 to October 1997. The median age was 41  +/-  5.3 years (range 18-69; n = 65). Preoperative body weight was 135  +/-  23 kg (96-229; n = 65), excess body weight in kg was 75  +/-  6.9 (44-155; n = 65) or in % 126  +/-  10 (78-223; n = 65) and BMI was 49  +/-  7.4 kg/m2 (39-69; n = 65). Mean hospital stay was 9.7  +/-  2.4 days (6-18; n = 65). Hospital mortality was 0 % (0/65). Early complications were vomiting (30 %) and problems in wound healing (15 %; n = 65). Late complications (> 30 days) were incisional hernias (13.8 %) and staple-line disruptions (12.3 %; n = 65) with a reoperation rate of 23 % (15/65). Median follow-up was 15.0  +/-  5.2 months (2-42) with a follow up rate of 100 %. Mean weight loss after 12 months was 38.5  +/-  17 kg (30-98; n = 34) (P < 0.0001) and loss of excessive body weight 65  +/-  10 % (57-86; n = 34), respectively (P < 0.0001). Cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) were significantly improved within 12 months (n = 34). Vertical banded gastroplasty (Mason procedure) - well established for 20 years - is a good, safe therapy for morbid obesity if strict indications for operation are observed and if there is multidisciplinary long-term follow-up. Co-morbid risk factors are considerably reduced and a long-term weight loss of more than 50 % can be achieved without the risk of pathological metabolic changes.
