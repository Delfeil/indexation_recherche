 Impaired movability of the vertebral joints causes one-sided compression and rotation of the disk. Causality can be safely assumed in view of the fact that disk prolapses occur on the side of the compression in more than 80 % of the cases. Since this impairment also reduces the foramen intervertebrale, space is even further reduced by a disk prolapse. Treatment of the impairment is recommended.
