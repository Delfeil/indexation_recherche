Abstract.  A 54-year-old woman patient had symptoms of stomatitis and asthma following the provision of a dental prothesis in July 1991. We found a positive patch test reaction to palladium only, without any concomitant metallic contact dermatitis; in particular there was no sensitization to nickel. This is a very rare sensitization. After replacement of the dental alloy the clinical symptoms improved.
