 sentha is an interdisciplinary research team involving the Technical University Berlin, the Berlin Institute for Social Research GmbH (BIS), the German Centre for Research on Ageing at the University of Heidelberg (DZFA), the School of Fine Arts Berlin (HdK), and the Brandenburg Technical University Cottbus (BTU). Building on empirical investigations of the role of everyday household products in the everyday life of older people, product-independent design and assessment guidelines and new products are being developed in an intensive interdisciplinary process in order to better meet the needs of older people and to enhance their autonomous living. The following paper describes the contributions from the participating disciplines and presents initial results of the social sciences subproject, describing the problems arising in living independently in old age and detecting the demands on new technological solutions. Data are based on a representative survey conducted in 1999 and including a stratified sample of 1417 men and women aged 55 and older.
