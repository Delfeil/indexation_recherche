Craniofacial malformations and trauma often lead to changes in orbital soft tissues that require operative correction of both hard and soft tissues. CT scan and 3D reconstructions are optimal tools for the evaluation of the bony structures but there is no equivalent for the orbital soft tissues. The aim of this study was to establish a 3D-MRI technique that allows differentiated visualization of the different soft-tissue types of the orbit.  A total of eight patients with different pathologic conditions of the orbit were examined. Five of these patients came for secondary correction after trauma and three showed a craniofacial malformation. 3D reconstruction was performed in volume-rendering technique after acquisition of 3 mm axial slices. It was shown that differentiated visualization of the orbital soft tissues is possible. Even though the thin bony structures have a weak signal and therefore the imaging is poor, the globe could be reconstructed reliably by different radiologists because of its circular delimitation from the bone. This technique provides additional support in the planning of orbital operations.
