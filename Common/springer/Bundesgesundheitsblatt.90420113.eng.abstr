New therapeutic approaches in surgery, transplantation, and cancer therapy make likely that the need for blood and blood components will continue. The development of artificial oxygen carriers for clinical use appears to be desirable, to overcome several problems encountered with human blood and blood products: the risk of transmission of infectious diseases (which, however is very low meanwhile), the need for determination of blood groups and the use of compatible blood, the limited availability of blood donations, and the precautions necessary to store the liable blood components for a limited time. Native stroma free haemoglobin cannot be used as blood substitute. Different approaches to solve the problem of breakdown into dimers of stroma free haemoglobin after injection into circulation have been used. Modification of the haemoglobin-molecule has to be performed, either by crosslinking or conjugation, or by enclosure in encapsulated particles. Several preclinical and clinical trials have been carried out showing different results relating to their indication, efficacy and side effects compared to native blood products. Further investigations will be necessary to develop suitable artificial haemoglobins and to demonstrate their therapeutic value; so far, the classical donated blood is far from being superseded by artificial blood substitutes.
