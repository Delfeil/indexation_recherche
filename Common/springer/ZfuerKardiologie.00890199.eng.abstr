 Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a rare cause of left ventricular outflow obstruction in adults. It occurs as an isolated defect sporadically or on a hereditary basis with an autosomal dominant trait without further phenotypical anomalies, or as part of the Williams syndrome with mental retardation and multiple other anomalies. This lesion was proved to result from a defect of the elastin coding gene.
