 Evidence from development psychology is reported that suggests that the ability to inpute mental states to others and to share emotions with them is part of the biological endowment of the newborn. A proper development of these capacities requires, however, within a specific range of fixed parameters, a fitting pattern of interactions between mother and baby. The emotional development of the infant critically depends on whether highly specific requirements for a successful emotional synchronisation and fitting have been fulfilled. From a psychoanalytic perspective corresponding results and insights from developmental psychology are of immediate relevance for a therapeutic understanding and treatment of even very severe forms of psychopathology. In a case study implications for the unfolding of the therapeutic process are illustrated.
