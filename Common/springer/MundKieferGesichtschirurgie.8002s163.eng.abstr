Ultrasound contrast agent is used in color Doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels. We present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained. Up until now, 30 patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus, tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined. Conventional B-scan sonography was supplemented by non-contrast color Doppler flow imaging. Depending on the indication, 2.5 g Levovist in bolus or 4 g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of 300 or 400 mg/ml. The administration of the contrast agent was tolerated by all patients without any side effects and in all cases led to a remarkable enhancement of the Doppler signals. About 15 to 30 s after injection, an enhancement in perfused vessels was detected. The fractioned injection of 4 g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than 10 min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent. In 64% of the lymph nodes, vessels could only be identified with the administration of Levovist. The general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83% of the cases. The lymph-node-supplying vessels were identified in 8 of 11 patients after the injection of contrast media. Additional information, which was gained in 17 patients, increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept. In three cases, the examinations with the signal enhancer resulted in a change in therapy. By applying signal enhancer in color Doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded.
