The documentation system of the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, University of Heidelberg, records routine psychodiagnostic and psychotherapeutic procedures in standardized form. With regard to the clinic's psychosomatic orientation the system registers not only socio-demographic and clinical findings but emphasizes primarily aspects of the therapeutic relationship, the central conflict and the structural disorder as evaluated in the initial diagnostics, in the treatment and in the results. Most of the scales were developed in the team itself. The resulting data formed the basis for clinical research and supplemented by further scales for specific projects in psychotherapeutic research. In returning the results regularly to the departments of the clinic (indoor and outdoor) and thereby making diagnostic and therapeutic process transparent with regard to their way of functioning and efficacy, the system offers an important contribution to quality control. The article characterizes item-groups and scales individually and illustrates the working of the system using clinical examples.
