In the literature, the importance of the menisci for stability, the degree of arthrosis, and load transmission in the knee joint is well documented. A total of 60 patients were followed after meniscus repair for an average of 8 years postoperatively. For a more accurate evaluation of the results, the expression "failure rate" was used, which indicates the number of reoperations and the number of patients with symptoms of locking at follow-up.
