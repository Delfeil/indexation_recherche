 In the present study, for the first time the aspects of risk, benefit and the costs of laparoscopic hernioplasty in the transabdominal technique with preperitoneal placement of a polypropylene mesh are examined prospectively in a very large group of patients with 3,400 hernia repairs. The median operation time was 45 min for unilateral primary hernias, 50 min for unilateral recurrent hernias and 76 min for bilateral hernias. The frequency of complications showed a significant dependence on the individual steps in the development of the method and the individual learning curve. The same is true for the rate of recurrency. Whereas initially the rate of serious complications was 2.75 %, the rate of minor complications 11 % and the rate of recurrences 4.5 % the corresponding figures are at present 0.4 %, 4.4 % and 0.5 %. Laparoscopic hernioplasty proved to be equally as effective in the treatment of primary hernias, recurrent hernias and bilateral hernias. The large number of 11 surgeons participating proves that laparoscopic hernioplasty can be learned and that even in a teaching hospital it can be performed safely, efficiently and cost-effectively.
