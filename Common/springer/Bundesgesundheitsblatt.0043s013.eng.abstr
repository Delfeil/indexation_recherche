The risk of occupational infection with HIV is subjectively often overestimated. This is in contrast to the fact, that other viral infections are more frequent and contagious. In medical services Hepatitis B is now the most frequent occupational viral infection. Prevention of infection is the most important measure. The "Unfallverhütungs-Vorschriften" of the "Berufsgenossenschaft" are giving advices how to work in medical services to prevent infections. Another important issue are vaccinations.There is a clear recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination in health care workers. After contamination of unvaccinated health care workers with suspicious materials for hepatitis B an active and passive immunisation is demanded. For the case of hepatitis C there does not exist medical post-exposure-prophylaxis. The early intervention with Interferon after establishing the diagnosis of acute hepatitis C seems to have a high efficacy.
