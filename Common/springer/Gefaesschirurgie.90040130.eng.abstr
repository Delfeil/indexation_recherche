 The question of how to optimal employ postoperative pharmacotherapy following peripheral artery interventions remains controversial, although peripheral bypass operations provide an excellent model for various antithrombotic regimens. The aim of this overview is to evaluate current attitudes and discuss future aspects of adjunctive treatment. Based upon different review articles and a literature search employing the Random Controlled Trials Registry of the Cochrane Library Data Base, we used the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on "Clinical Research and Vascular Surgery" of the Vascular Surgery Society (SVS) to evaluate the various levels of available evidence on how best to employ antithrombotic therapy. The grade A recommendation is the most scientifically sound, usually definitive, advice based upon large numbers of patients; the trial was prospectively randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind (?); it is therefore of multicentric design. The grade-C recommendation is derived from non-randomized comparative studies using either contemporaneous or historical controls, or case histories. Heparin is widely used among vascular surgeons, although the methods of application vary; therefore only a grade C recommendation is appropriate. Platelet active agents, acetyl salicylic acid in particular, in medium doses, are the most intensely tested substances, so the advice for long-term (lifelong?) use regarding patency and survival is based on the highest level of evidence from many large trials and meta-analyses; thus, a grade A recommendation is justified. Ticlopidine shows promise, but further confirmative evidence is needed. The combination of antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants might be a worthwhile option, although the risk of complications is substantial. A combination of the two, but in reduced dosages, might turn out to be attractive. Low-molecular-weight dextran has been shown in a multicentre trial to be effective in short-term use, so a grade A recommendation seems justified.
