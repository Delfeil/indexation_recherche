Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10%. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs more frequent (85%) and more severe compared to lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source. Prognosis and mortality are dependent on intensity of bleeding, reflected by clinical signs such as shock, hemoglobin level, transfused blood units, hematemesis, presence of comorbidity and age of the patient. Furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality. Therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding.
