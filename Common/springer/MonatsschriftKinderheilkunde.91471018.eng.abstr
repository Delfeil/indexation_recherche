We report on a 15-months-old girl with a history of recurrent phlegmones of the lower eyelid, dacryocystitides, conjunctivities and mucositis together with growth-retardation, chronic obstipation and anal prolaps. During a period of 19 days absolute neutropenia was observed. Retrospectively, neutrophil counts were between 0-500/µl from birth on. Bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of granulopoiesis at the stage of promyelocytes. Continuous therapy with 10  µg/kg/d of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) induced 12-day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts. There were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines. Growth retardation and prolaps of anus normalized, and few intercurrent bacterial infections, pneumonia and impetigo contagiosa occurred. A mutation in the G-CSF-receptor gene was not found in this patient. Monosomia 7 was excluded. After 2 years of therapy, a reduction of rhG-CSF dose (application every 2 days) lead to a severe neutropenia.
