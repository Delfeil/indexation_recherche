Many different therapeutic approaches are employed to treat small vessels on the leg. In recent years a variety of lasers (argon, Neodymium: YAG and dye lasers) have been used as well as sclerotherapy, cryosurgery and electrosurgery. None of these lasers are entirely satisfactory, and there are a number of side effects. Because of its special physical characteristics, the newly developed long-pulsed frequency-doubled neodymium: YAG laser has clear advantages in the treatment of vascular lesions compared to other laser systems. These include: no vessel rupture compared to dye laser, no epidermal lesions compared to argon laser. In clinical tests it shows a high rate of effectiveness with minimal side effects.
