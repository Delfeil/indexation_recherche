Interventional MRI is one of the most recent developments of clinical MR imaging. Because of the development of open MR systems and very compact high-field systems, a number of interventional procedures are already possible today under MR control and will be tested in experimental and clinical investigations. The currently commercially available systems differ with respect to their static magnetic field strength, their gradient systems and patient access. In addition, there are differences concerning their space requirements and costs. All systems have components facilitating interventional procedures. In this article we discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these commercially available systems and look at future developments in interventional MR equipment.
