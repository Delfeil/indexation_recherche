  We report on a patient in whom a restenosis after two PTCA procedures was treated with directional coronary atherectomy. In the second DCA maneuvre a spiral dissection, type D, developed from ostium to restenosis with a balloon shaped part in the wall of the aorta ascendens. This part disappeared nearly completely by next day. The dissection in the right coronary artery persisted three months later until a bypass operation and was not visible after two years.
