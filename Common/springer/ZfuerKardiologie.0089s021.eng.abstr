 Magnetic resonance imaging of the coronary arteries is difficult due to the tortuous course of these vessels, their small diameter, and their rapid movement caused by respiration and cardiac contraction. Initial investigations could demonstrate the feasability of non-invasive magnetic resonance coronary angiography using 2-dimensional turbo-FLASH gradient-echo sequences in repeated breathholds of approximately 16 heart beats duration. Further developments, especially the design of navigator-echo-based respiratory gated 3-dimensional imaging sequences, permitted the acquisition of contiguous volume data sets of the heart which eliminated many limitations of 2-dimensional repeated breathhold sequences. With a spatial resolution of approximately 1.2 x 1.2 x 2 mm and a temporal resolution of approximately 126 ms, several authors reported sensitivities of 70-80% and specificities of approximately 90% for the detection of coronary artery stenoses. Further improvements can be expected from new, intravascular contrast agents and from ultrafast sequences which permit acquisition of a sufficiently large imaging volume within one single breathhold.
