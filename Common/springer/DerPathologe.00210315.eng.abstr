We present a case of serous cystadenofibroma 2 cm in diameter in the epiploic appendix of the sigmoid as incidental finding in a 72-year-old patient who underwent hysterectomy and oophorectomy for endometrial carcinoma. The tumor showed the same histology as analogous tumors of the ovary and was associated with endosalpingiosis. Further findings were large adhesions between the epiploic appendices of the sigmoid and the parietal peritoneum and atypical cells in the peritoneal washings. Both may be explained by occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis. The histogenesis, histology, and locations of extraovarian müllerian tumors are reviewed.
