Many modifications of tendon transfers have been described in the treatment of radial nerve palsy. Controversy persists over the muscles of choice to get the best results in motion of wrist and fingers. Patients with radial nerve palsy and treated by the methode of Merle d'Aubigne in neurophysiological tests showed that the pronator teres did not work very well for extending the wrist. Thinking about the neurophysiologic principles it seemed that the flexor digitorum superficialis of the middle and ring fingers would make a better substitute for the wrist extension. From 1994 to 1997 four patients with radial nerve palsy had a transfer of the flexor digitorum superficialis tendons from the middle and ring fingers to the tendons of extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis additional the flexor carpi ulnaris and palmaris longus transfers. The functional recovery of two patients has been tested. The functional range of wrist motion of this two patients has been better than in patients with pronator teres transfers. It can be concluded that the new modification of tendon transfers is a good way of treatment of radial nerve palsy and should be done further.
