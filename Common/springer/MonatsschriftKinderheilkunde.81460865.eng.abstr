We describe a 6 years old boy with symmetrical burning pain of feet and hands accompanied by local edema and arterial hypertonia. The symptoms were worsened by exposure to heat or exercise. Application of cold or elevation of the extremities relieved the painful sensations. In the absence of a primary disorder like autoimmune diseases or thrombocytosis, this rare disorder is classified as primary erythromelalgia/erythermalgia.
