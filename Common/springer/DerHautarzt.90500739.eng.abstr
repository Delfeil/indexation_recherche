A 60-year-old woman developed a periorbital lipogranuloma after endonasal surgery on her paranasal sinuses. The granulomatous inflammation was caused by nonabsorbable lipids introduced by the postoperative nasal tamponade which was soaked in antibiotic ointment. These lipids were transported into the periorbital tissue by the postoperative hemorrhage. Since the course of the inflammatory process is chronic, surgical removal is the best treatment.
