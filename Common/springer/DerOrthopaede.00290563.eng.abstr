Halm-Zielke Instrumentation (HZI) was developed to eliminate the disadvantage of ventral derotation spondylodesis (VDS)- Zielke in terms of lack of primary stability and in order to simplify sagittal plane control. Within a prospective clinical trial started in 1993, we have studied whether HZI fulfills these demands.
