The methodology used to assess postoperative continence has a significant effect on the outcome of incontinence surgery. Retrospective chart review studies consistently report higher success rates than patient questionnaire-based outcome analyses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the true long-term results of the Stamey bladder neck suspension procedure using an anonymous patient questionnaire. Of 172 consecutive patients, 138 (80.2 %) returned a questionnaire on long-term continence, complications and subjective satisfaction with the operative result. With a mean follow-up of 66 months, 65 of 130 evaluable patients (50.0 %) remained completely continent while 15 (11.5 %) never became continent and 50 (38.5 %) had recurrent incontinence 6-90 months postoperatively. Almost two-thirds of the patients felt either cured or substantially improved more than 5 years after surgery. Stamey bladder neck suspension leads to a persistently improved quality of life despite a considerable failure rate. Our study demonstrates the advantages of patient questionnaires for outcome analyses and emphasizes the need for standardisation and validation to allow comparisons between the results of different incontinence procedure in the future.
