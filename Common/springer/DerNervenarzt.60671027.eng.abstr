A woman with severe stiff-man syndrome showed periodic cardiovascular dysregulation. The blood pressure changed spontaneously every 5-10 min. This rhythm was also maintained after relaxation. However, the vegetative and motoric disturbances disappeared after intrathecal application of baclofen. It is speculated that spinal GABAergic mechanisms are responsible for the tonic regulation of the cardiovascular system.
