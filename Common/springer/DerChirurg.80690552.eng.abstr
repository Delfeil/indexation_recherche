 138 surgical institutions in Germany retrospectively answered a questionnaire on available energy sources, techniques of preparation and complications due to the use of electric current in laparoscopic surgery. The median experience in this field of surgery was 6 years. For common laparoscopic operations the majority of surgeons use electrosurgery; only 8 % never do so. Except in appendectomy, monopolar cautery is preferred for all operations. Other energy devices are of minor importance. The overall number of operations reported was nearly 138 000. The rate of complications due to the use of electric current was 0.1 %. This figure is accomted for inequal part by intra- and postoperative burns. The complication rate is at the lower end of the range known from the literature. Even though the retrospective nature of this analysis may hide a certain number of injuries electric, current plays a minor role for complications in laparoscopic surgery.
