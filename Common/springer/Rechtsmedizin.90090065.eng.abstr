 A 66-year-old woman died of internal bleeding and pulmonary fat embolism following repeated massive blows from a wickerwork carpetbeater and an electric cable. The initial autopsy diagnosis was natural death. A second autospy on the exhumed body and an intensive criminal investigation revealed a long history of maltreatment by two sisters with whom the victim lived. The maltreatment occurred during exorcisms with the purported purpose of ridding the victim of her possession by Satan. The perpetrators and the victim belonged to the same pseudoreligous sect. The elder of the two sisters had been previously convicted of a fatal exorcism maltreatment of a 17-year-old girl.
