 Hospitals are facing increasing economic pressure. It therefore seems necessary to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of medical or surgical interventions. In this study 324 anastomoses (167 stapled and 157 hand-sewn) were performed after randomization during 200 elective operations [20.5 % gastrectomies, 14 % gastric resections (Billroth II), 15 % Whipple's procedures, 4 % segmental colonic resections, 18 % right-sided hemicolectomies, 4 % left-sided hemicolectomies, 22 % sigmoid- or anterior rectal resections, 2.5 % total colectomies with pouch-anal anastomoses] in 200 patients. Postoperative motility (time to full oral diet, time with naso-gastric tube) and hospitalization were comparable in both groups. Anastomotic insufficiency was observed in 2.1 % of all patients, five after stapled and two after hand-sewn anastomoses. Hospital mortality was 1.5 %. All stapled anastomoses were performed significantly (P < 0.001) faster. However, the cost of material for these anastomoses was significantly (P < 0.001) higher, resulting in significantly higher total costs for reconstruction. The time saving for the reconstruction did not influence the total operative time (except for stapled gastrectomy). Therefore, all operations with stapled reconstruction were more expensive than those with sutured reconstruction. The difference was significant for the gastrectomy (P < 0.01), colonic resection (P < 0.01) and sigmoid and rectal resection (P < 0.001) groups. Stapled and sutured anastomoses are equally effective. Stapled anastomoses are not efficient, however, and should be reserved for individual indications.
