Fungus-bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe Candida albicans infection. A newborn infant with VACTERL-association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after Candida albicans sepsis, and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure. Following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin B via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly. Discussion: Since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should include fungus balls.
