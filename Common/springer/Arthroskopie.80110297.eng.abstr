Analysis of 147 repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the Department of Surgery at the Herz-Jesu Krankenhaus, Fulda, from 1990 to 1995, showed that meniscal lesions were the most common (n = 89, 60.5%). The majority of meniscal lesions (n = 45, 50.6%) occurred in menisci that had already been partially resected. The most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions. Conversely, contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in 18 cases (20.2%), while de-novo lesions occurred in 29 cases (29.2%). A coincidence of meniscal injury with first- or second-grade cartilage damage was documented  in 35 patients (39.3%), whereas 54 patients (60.7%) had normal intra-articular cartilage. Cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy. The most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage-shaving. Concerning patients' postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by OAK score, the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function (65.2%) and showed good or excellent outcome in the OAK score (88.8%). Patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area (p < 0.05). In conclusion, in patients with positive meniscal signs and a history of previous meniscal surgery, repeat arthroscopy is generally and early indicated and can be recommended as a valid method to assess cartilage damage objectively. However, patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit.
