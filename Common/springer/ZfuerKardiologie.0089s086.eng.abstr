 The intravenous application of an ultrasound contrast agent induces enhanced display of blood in all its pathways. Within cardiology, this principle is mainly utilized for signal enhancement of color Doppler and spectral Doppler in order to improve quantification of congenital and acquired valvular lesions and also for improved endocardial delineation during stress tests and in the evaluation of LV function.
