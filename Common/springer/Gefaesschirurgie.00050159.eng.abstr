  Large multicenter studies have recently provided long-term results substantiating the superiority of surgical as compared to conservative therapy for symptomatic and asymptomatic extracranial internal carotid stenoses of more than 70%. These results led to an increase in the frequency of thromboendarterectomies (TEA). However, indications are limited by the perioperative complication rate. This explains the need for a reliable method of immediate intraoperative quality control. The present prospective study investigates the value of microvascular Doppler sonography (MDS) in carotid TEA. Of 39 patients who underwent carotid TEA of symptomatic (n=19) or asymptomatic (n=20) carotid stenosis, more than 70% were submitted to both intraoperative angiography (IOA) and MDS. The sensitivity and specificity of the two techniques were compared in the light of the intraoperative findings. IOA has a higher sensitivity in demonstrating minimal sacciform pouch, which, however, is not therapeutically relevant. In other respects, both methods are of equal value. There were no therapeutically relevant false negative results by MDS. It appears to be advisable to apply MDS routinely in cases of carotid TEA. Intraoperative angiography should be performed in patients in whom changes detected by MDS require morphologic confirmation.
