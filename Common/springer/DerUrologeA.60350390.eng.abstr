Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an essential role in specific cell deletion during normal embryonal and adult development. Apoptotic cells are characterized by fragmentation of nuclear DNA and formation of apoptotic bodies. Molecular genetic analysis has revealed the involvement of several deaths and survival genes that are regulated by extracellular and intracellular factors. There are multiple inducers and inhibitors which interact with target cellspecific receptors and transduce signals involved in cellular proliferation, cell cycle progression and programmed cell death. The elimination of tumor cell populations by applying lethal doses of chemotherapeutic agents or radiation is a well-established strategy in cancer therapy. Although improved cytotoxic chemo- and radiotherapy regimens are available, the efficacy of these strategies is still disappointing with regard to many solid tumors. Better understanding of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis, including death genes, death signals, receptors and signal transduction pathways, will provide new approaches in the development of strategies to regulate malignant cell survival and death. Recent discoveries in the field of apoptotic cell death promise to have a significant impact on antitumor therapies. Apoptosis is known to be an active process which can be artificially manipulated by several molecular pathways. This information concerning the regulation and induction of programmed cell death might lead among otherthings, to the development of new powerful means to eliminate malignant cell populations of otherwise resistant genitourinary tumors such as prostate cancer.
