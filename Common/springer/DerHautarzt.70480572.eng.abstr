In the literature, a number of observers reported that acrokeratosis verruciformis (Hopf) often evolves in cases of keratosis follicularis. The relationship of these verruciform manifestations to keratosis follicularis is discussed. In this paper, we present three patients with Darier's disease, who have verruciform papules on the dorsal surfaces of the hands and feet. Histopathologically, the papules showed the distinctive structures of Darier's disease. Therefore, these lesions are regarded as an abortive form of keratosis follicularis. It is necessary to examine carefully the punch biopsies histomorphologically. We also recommend having a closer look at the development of other typical Darier's skin lesions in the follow-up of patients.
