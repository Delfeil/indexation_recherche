 To explore the relationship between coronary artery disease and renal vascular disease, we performed renal arterial angiography in 609 patients undergoing coronary angiography for suspected coronary artery disease. We defined renal artery stenosis as nonsignificant (<40%), borderline (40-60%) and significant (>60%). One-hundred fifty-two patients had renal artery stenosis, while 457 did not. Two-hundred and ten patients had no coronary disease; of these, only 9 had renal artery stenosis. On the other hand, the 143 patients with renal artery stenosis, when subdivided, had similar degrees of coronary disease; three vessel disease was significantly more common than one or two vessel disease in all groups. Renal artery stenosis of all severity degrees was associated with common atherosclerotic risk factors. However, hypertension was not a clue to the presence of renal artery stenosis. To evaluate the effect of percutaneous revascularization on hypertension and renal function all 51 patients with significant renal artery stenosis were treated by primary stent implantation and were follwed up for 6 months. Stent implantation showed a marked decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (163 +/- 30 to 145 +/- 17 and 93 +/- 18 to 83 +/- 10 mmHg; p=0.008) with a decrease in the amount of antihypertensive medication but without beneficial effect on serum creatinine during follow-up (1.46 +/- 0.70 mg/dl to 1.39 +/- 0.58 mg/dl, p=ns). We conclude that renal artery stenosis of any severity is strongly suggestive of three vessel coronary artery disease. The fact that renal stenting lowers blood pressure decreases antihypertensive drugs and increases medication flexibility in patients with coronary artery disease would support the notion of revascularization in patients with significant stenoses.
