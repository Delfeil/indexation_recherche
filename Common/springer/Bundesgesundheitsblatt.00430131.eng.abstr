The German drug market offers thymus preparations, among other agents, for treatment of rheumatic diseases. The published data on thymus products are based on case reports, on studies with inadequate and partly ethically questionable design and on investigations that were too short and comprised too few patients to allow scientific valid conclusions. Therefore, reflecting the current status of scientific knowledge, and in consideration of the risks possibly associated with the use of thymus preparations for treatment of rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), there is no medical substantiation for a recommendation of this therapy.
