 We examined the correlation between two different methods to measure cardiac output in 12 patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA III-IV).   Using a Swan-Ganz catheter (Baxter 746H-8F) we measured cardiac output according to the thermodilution bolus method and to the continuous thermodilution method, which works automatically by delivering pulses of energy from a thermal filament on the catheter. Sodium nitroprusside was infused in four increasing doses. Every 60 minutes, the dose was increased. We performed measurements at 11 time points (3 at baseline and 8 every 30 minutes during application of sodium nitroprusside). Statistical analysis was calculated according to the Spearman formula.   Results: The values for cardiac output by the thermodilution bolus method and the continuous method showed significant correlation at 8 of 11 time points.   Conclusion: The continuous method allows fast and reliable measurement of cardiac output while pharmacologically changing hemodynamics.
