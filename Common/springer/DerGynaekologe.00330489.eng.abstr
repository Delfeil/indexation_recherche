The care of the patient after primary treatment is very important for both tumor control and patientsi compliance. The aim of this care concept should be the early detection of local recurrences so as to have better secondary treatment (maybe cure) options. If expensive diagnostics are needed to get this information, it is reasonable to order them. If there is no benefit for the patient, regarding survival or with respect to quality of life, clinical anamnesis and examination should be preferred.
