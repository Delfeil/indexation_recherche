Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP) is performed to improve nasal form and function. The purpose of this study was to compare the initial findings and the surgical outcome in 30 patients with unilateral CLP. Open rhinoplasty was carried out to correct nasal deformity. Nasal soft tissue analysis was done by measurement of standardized raster photographs of the nose and lateral teleradiography. Deviations from the ideal form regarding nasal symmetry, nasal width, and alar base line were determined. The nasal profile was assessed by measuring the nasofacial and nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurt horizontal plane (FHP), and the angle between the columella and the FHP. Nasal patency was evaluated by rhinomanometry. The overall flow (cm3/s) was determined and the flow of the cleft side and non-cleft side compared. Evaluations were made immediately before and 6 months after surgery. In the frontal plane, nasal symmetry was significantly improved and the alar form adjusted. The deep position of the columella was corrected. The acute nasofacial angle and the drooping ala were not significantly improved. An increase in the overall flow and correction of the quotient cleft/non-cleft side was achieved by the surgical procedure. In this study, aesthetically and functionally relevant findings were objectified and can be used for quality control.
