Primary intracranial germ cell tumors are rare neurological diseases. Secreting germ cell tumors that predominantly appear in the pineal region are characterized by elevated levels of -HCG and AFP in CSF. Adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate. We present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of -HCG in CSF. Six years before, a pineocytoma of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy. This demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline-sized brain-tumors by evaluation of -HCG and AFP in CSF and serum. Today, different therapeutic strategies depending on the histological diagnosis are available and justify a high priority of a surgical tumor biopsy. However, the value of stereotaxic procedures remains controversial. Recently published data gave evidence of a definite improved prognosis of secreting CNS germ cell tumors following combined treatment with high-dose polychemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation of the tumor area.  -HCG and AFP may serve as useful markers to enable follow-up of the disease.
