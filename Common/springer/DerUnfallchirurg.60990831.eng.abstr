We examined 30 patients with an arthroscopic suture repair for anterior shoulder instability in a retrospective evaluation. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 58 months with an average of 22 months. Arthroscopic suture repairs were done on 14 patients (acute group, average age 26.1 years) with acute detached glenoid labrum, confirmed on arthro-CT, within 10 days after the injury and on 16 patients (secondary group, average age 25 years) with chronic should dislocation. The evaluation according to the Rowe scale resulted in a mean score of 97.1 for the acute group, compared with 92.7 for the secondary group. In each group we found one recurrent dislocation, which in the acute group was due to an adequate trauma. Two of the 14 acute group patients showed a reduction in external rotation of up to 20 °, compared with 6 patients in the secondary group. The external rotation of one patient in the secondary group was reduced to 40 °. The isokinetic muscle strength was decreased in both groups, both for 60 °/s and for 120 °/s, to 85% compared with the healthy side. The primary surgical therapy of young patients (below 25 years) with an acute shoulder dislocation and a detached glenoid labrum is recommended owing to the lower redislocation rate, an overall shortened course of treatment and a trend to better postsurgical range of motion.
