Background: Until recently, we have had to depend on digital dacryocystography and on clinical examinations such as the fluorescein dye test, lacrimal probing and irrigation for diagnosis of disorders of the lacrimal system. Now the lacrimal system and its mucuos membranes can be viewed directly with a lacrimal endoscope. While the first endoscopes were rigid and limited by poor picture quality in axial illuminations, the new generation of endoscopes are a great leap forward for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
