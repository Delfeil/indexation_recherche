 The ileoanal pouch procedure (IAPP) was the most remarkable breakthrough in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in the last 20 years. The underlying disease is under control, the function preserved and the quality of life markedly improved. Alternative procedures (terminal ileostomy, ileorectal anastomosis) are only indicated in special cases. In the last 16 years we have operated on 662 patients (n = 493 UC; n = 169 FAP) with an ileoanal J-pouch, short rectal cuff, complete mucosectomy and hand-sewn anastomosis. Normally there is a good function for UC and FAP patients after IAPP. Surgical experience, technical modifications concerning the pouch design and the pouch-anal anastomosis, and a differentiated indication lead to a further improvement of these complex procedures with consecutive reduction of complications. Specific complications concerned mainly the pouch-anal anastomosis (fistulas, abscesses, consecutive stenosis) and inflammation of the pouch mucosa (pouchitis). A multivariate analysis showed, that increasing experience of the specialized center is a significant factor reducing inflammatory problems at the anastomosis. The cumulative incidence of pouchitis was 29 %. In general there is no problem in successful treatment. But patients with chronic pouchitis are a problematic group (6.2 %). Chronic pouchitis is difficult to treat. It is likely that there exists an inflammation dysplasia carcinoma sequence for the ileal pouch mucosa, analogous to the colorectum. Recently we diagnosed the first case of a real ileum pouch carcinoma with associated epithelial dysplasias following chronic pouchitis. Therefore patients with chronic pouchitis must be followed up by endoscopy and random biopsies in a surveillance program. Patients with UC and FAP can gain the life quality of healthy controls, if postoperative complications can be avoided or treated successfully. For the further development of the procedure and the individual long-term success a qualified follow-up and therapy of complications is essential. Both can be carried out only by a specialized center.
