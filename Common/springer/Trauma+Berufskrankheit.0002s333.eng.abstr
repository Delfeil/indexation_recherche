Since 1995, a total of 115 patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment. After the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment. The mean follow-up period for all patients was 31 months (range 3-50 months. In 87 cases (75.7%) bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms. Apart from low-grade local reactions (swelling, haematoma, petechiae) no complications were observed. The treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing.
