 Minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been developed to offer patients the benefits of open heart operations with decreased pain and limited skin incision. In this study, we report the results of minimally AVR compared to the conventional method performed in the same period. From May 1996 to January 1998, 86 patients received isolated aortic valve replacement by the limited superior median sternotomy (group 1). As a control group (group 2), 78 patients were enrolled who underwent isolated aortic valve replacements by standard sternotomy in the same period.
