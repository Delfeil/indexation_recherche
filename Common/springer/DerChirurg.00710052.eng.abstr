 Objective: The aim of this randomized controlled study was to show whether local anesthesia (LA) leads to a decrease of postoperative pain in inguinal hernia repair in comparison with general anesthesia (AA). Method: Sixty volunteer patients were randomly assigned into a LA group and an AA group. All patients had an unilateral primary inguinal hernia and underwent inguinal hernia repair (Shouldice technique). Methods to determine pain were the visual analog scale (VAS), peak flow measurement, the measurement of the FEV1 %, and analgesic consumption. Results: Up to the third postoperative day we measured a decreased pain level in the LA group. The anesthesia procedure was never changed. No essential complications occurred. Conclusion: Therefore, it was concluded that local anesthesia has more advantages than general anesthesia.
