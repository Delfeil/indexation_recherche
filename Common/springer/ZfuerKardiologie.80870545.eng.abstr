  For invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media (CM) with excellent tolerability are available. The governing practical factors for CM are X-ray opacity and biocompatibility. Tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity, osmolality, and ionic concentration. In Germany the nonionic CM are currently preferred. Because of its low thrombotic complications, the ionic CM Ioxaglat is an important alternative in high risk interventions. In patients with known CM incompatibility, the prophylactic application of H1-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications. In impaired renal function, hydration is the most effective prophylactic measure to be taken.
