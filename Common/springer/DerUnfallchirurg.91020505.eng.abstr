The field surgery has been structured into four specialties of equal importance that are Thoracic Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Visceral Surgery and last but not least Trauma Surgery. Each specialty defines it's research tasks. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the situation of research in trauma surgery and define future topics and programs. The aim of this survey was to cover the present research situation in Germany. Out of the 200 questionnaires 112 were available for evaluation. The major deficiencies were stated to be a lack of personnel, budget and coordination of topics and resources. Of general interest was to initiate activities of the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) in view of coordination of research activities, setting up of new funds and integration of teaching hospitals into university research programs. The data, shown in this article, may serve to start a discussion aiming on the improvement of the financial and scientific environment.
