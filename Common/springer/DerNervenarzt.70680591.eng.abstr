As compared to other tri- and tetracyclics, antidepressant therapy in patients suffering also from cardiac disease with mianserin is known to be relatively safe. Hypertensive effects of mianserin have not been described so far. We report a case of a 64 years old patient with a dilatative cardiomyopathy and left anterior hemiblock, who developed hypertension (maximum: 180/125 mmHg) during mianserin treatment. Previous treatment with tranylcypromine has been stopped two weeks before. After discontinuance of mianserin blood pressure rapidly came back to normal values. The possible noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms of this phenomenon are discussed in relation to pretreatment with tranylcypromine.
