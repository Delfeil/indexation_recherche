 Emergency treatment of bleeding ulcer of the duodenum is endoscopy and endoscopic bloodstaunching. In high-risk patients with Forrest I a lesions or ulcers with visible vessel (Forrest II a) endoscopic follow-up or early elective operation is required. Fibrin sealing can improve the results of endoscopic injection therapy for bleeding ulcer. Nevertheless, severe complications such as secondary perforation of the fibrin clot or recurrent bleeding can occur. Identification of high-risk patients and complications requires close monitoring and attention. A case of a secondary perforation of a bleeding ulcer of the duodenum after fibrin sealing is reported.
