  Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a high incidence of coronary artery disease. In 30-60% of these patients coronary artery disease can be demonstrated by coronary angiography often prompting myocardial revascularization. Previous studies on PTCA in patients with ESRD have suggested a high rate of procedural complications and restenosis. We studied the rate of restenosis after PTCA in 23 patients with chronic renal failure (17 males, 6 females, age: 52.5  +/-  18.3 years). After primarily successful PTCA all patients were restudied angiographically within 6-12 months. Using quantitative coronary angiography 13 patients (56%) demonstrated restenosis (stenosis > 50% luminal diameter). In 11 of these patients further revascularization therapy was indicated (6 x PTCA, 5 x CABG). Before follow-up angiography 12 patients demonstrated recurrence of angina pectoris, the sensitivity of clinical symptoms for angiographic restenosis was 69%. High concentrations of triglycerides (265  +/-  160 mg/dl), total cholesterol (258  +/-  53 mg/dl) with low HDL-levels (34  +/-  14 mg/dl) as well as elevated plasma levels of fibrinogen (481  +/-  114 mg/dl) were measured before PTCA.
