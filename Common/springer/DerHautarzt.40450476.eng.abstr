 We report on a 45-year-old male patient who presented with classic cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). The clinical course extended over 7 years. In spite of 2 years of immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine and methylprednisolone the course was progressive. Low-dose methotrexate therapy was the only treatment that controlled the disease, leading to rapid clinical and histopathological remission. In low concentrations methotrexate acts as an IL-1 inhibitor, and it obviously suppresses the pathogenetic mechanism of PAN.
