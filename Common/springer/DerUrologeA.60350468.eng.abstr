Leydig cell tumors are the most common tumors of the gonadal stroma. They account for 3 % of all testicular tumors. Whereas in 10 % of adult cases malignancy occurs, the clinical course in children is benign. During childhood the tumor presents with precocious pseudopuberty, in adults with testicular swelling and gynecomastia. We report on 17 cases of Leydig cell tumor, paying special attention to clinical and morphological aspects.
