 Background. Traditional open surgical management of popliteal arterio-venous fistula is both technically difficult and troublesome. Endovascular exclusion by transluminally placed stented grafts is a potentially less invasive new therapeutic option. Case report. A large popliteal arterio-venous fistula was diagnosed in a 26-year-old football player 5 years after a traumatic knee-joint injury with open repair of the ruptured anterior cruciale ligament. From the clinical aspect, a significant increase in leg volume and an enlargement of heart size were noticed. Therapy. After vascular surgeons and radiologists had established an interdisciplinary consensus, the endovascular approach was indicated. A Palmaz stent-anchored PTFE graft was percutaneously implanted via the femoral anterograde sheath access. A second endograft was implanted after 6 months to hemostatically exclude a persistent fistula. After 12-month follow-up, the stentgraft was still patent, and the patient was well and alive without any sign of leckage. Conclusion. The endoluminal implantation of stented grafts is a new therapeutic option in the management of chronic popliteal arterio-venous fistula.
