Twenty-five patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (stage pT3pN0) underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy and were followed up thereafter for at least 15 years. No hormonal treatment was given prior to tumor progression. Overall and disease-free 15-year survival rates were observed to be 44 and 24 %, respectively. These data suggest that a cure from prostate cancer by radical prostatectomy can be expected in a quarter of patients with capsular penetration. From our results, no justification can be derived to exclude radical prostatectomy from the spectrum of treatment options for patients with capsular penetration of prostate cancer. More detailed analysis of the results depending on the local extent of the tumor and histological grade revealed distinct differences with respect to the risk of progression. Histological grade was the single most predictive parameter of progression. Out of all subgroups of patients with capsular penetration of prostate cancer, those with a poorly differentiated tumor showed the shortest progression-free interval after surgery, the highest level of overall progression and the largest proportion of tumor-related deaths. By contrast, the prognosis was only slightly influenced by the presence or absence of seminal vesicle involvement. The role of adjuvant treatment after radical prostatectomy for patients with stage pT3pN0 prostate cancer or for subgroups of them remains to be determined within the scope of prospective randomized trials.
