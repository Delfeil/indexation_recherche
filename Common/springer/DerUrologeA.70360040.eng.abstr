Nineteen men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence grade II and III (mean follow-up 12.7 months) underwent periurethral injections of collagen. In all, 37 procedures were performed; 58 % of the patients underwent the procedure at least twice. A mean of 16 ml collagen was injected. The results were successful directly after injections, leaving all patients continent; however, after 3 months the treatment failed and all patients returned to their incontinence status as seen preoperatively. No perioperative complications were noted. Despite the simple and safe nature of this procedure, men with severe postoperative stress incontinence do not benefit from periurethral collagen injections.
