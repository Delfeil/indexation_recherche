Every 15th case of a bone fracture in patients aged more than 65 years concerns the distal radius in Germany. This means the second rank of all geriatric fractures following fractures of the hip. According to the approved and increased apply of operative stabilisation there are arising more and more reports upon poor results of nonsurgical treatment. Especially in older patients the main reason for the discontented outcome of conservative management is osteoporosis, which is an affirmative circumstance for the genesis of fracture but also for secondary malaligment of comminuted thin cortical walls and crushed porotic cancellous bone. The rational of this perception is either filling artificial bonelike tissue - avoiding the need of harvest cancellous bone graft from a second surgical site - into the resultant cavity following reduction, or supplementary transstyloidal or intrafocal K-wiring until remodeling is obtained within an average of 10 weeks. Both arrangements should be secured in addition with a transarticular external fixation. According to a literature review and our own experiences of 92 follow up cases of distal radius fractures in patients who were older than 65 years this procedure seems to be superior at present for A-2, A-3 and most cases of type-C fractures of the distal radius, despite the disadvantage of joint immobilisation for about 5 weeks. Type B-fractures, however, should be provided better with an internal fixation. Sudeck's algodystrophia is the mostly serious complication of the distal radius fracture and its treatment in older patients. Recognising punctually neurovegetative stimulated patients, treat them cautiously and coming in on their special situation is usually the best way to reduce this risk. To pay attention to the topography of the nerves during the application of the pins and to act at the first signs of complications immediately is also very important. We examined 92 patients who were older than 65 years with a fracture of the distal end of the radius in a follow up study. In this group we treated 62 distal radius fractures of the type A and C of the AO classification with an transarticular external fixateur and with supplementary measures if necessary. Additionally we filled the bone cavity with an artificial bone graft (Endobon) following closed reduction in 32 cases, 12 times a complementary K-wiring was added and in 8 cases the external fixateur was combined with both. Sudeck's disease appeared in 1.1 % of all cases. In 5 cases we recorded complications with an obligation to treatment as well. Lesion of the superficial branch of the radial nerve were noted in 2 cases (2,1 %), as far as we extended the surgical approach for the pin application. Technical problems from the site of the external fixateur appeared in 3 cases, two of them could be attributed to an infirmity of the fixateurs ball joints which is now eliminated by the producer. 4 patients with a type-B fracture was provided by plating, additionally 4 patients with a type-C fracture because of non-compliance. The external fixateur is an essential part of a differentiated treatment with reference to the several types of distal radius fractures in older patients.
