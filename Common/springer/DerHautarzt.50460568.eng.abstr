Polyarteritis nodosa is a multi-systemic vasculitic disease process involving small and medium-sized arteries throughout the body. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa has been described as a limited form involving the skin, skeletal muscles, and peripheral nerves. A protracted course of 20 years or longer, with few cases eventually developing visceral involvement, has been emphasized by many authors. A case of polyarteritis with a 20-year history of exacerbations and spontaneous remissions that never seriously compromised the patient's health is presented. The initial and predominant symptoms were leg pains, Raynaud's phenomenon, and nail defects (onychoschizia).
