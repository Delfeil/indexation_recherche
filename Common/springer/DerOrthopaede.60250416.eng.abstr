From 1971 to 1993, a total of 759 cases of nonunion of both the upper and lower extremities were treated. In recent years the frequency of these cases of nonunion has clearly declined. Analysis of patient data shows a positive trend particularly for nonunion in the lower arm and leg while at the same time nonunion in the upper arm and leg remained essentially constant. Moreover, the proportion of aseptic to septic manifestations has shifted towards the aseptic forms in a ratio of 1:0.5. The treatment results of a representative, randomly chosen group (n = 107 out of a total of 392) from 1981 to 1993 are satisfactory with little statistical deviation for the upper extremity. The least pleasing results were seen in nonunion of the lower leg, which differed from the somewhat better results for the upper leg on the OLERUD score, with a statistical significance of P < 0.05. This study shows a very interesting development in clinical results.
