  A quick and exact diagnosis of a ruptured aorta can be achieved by different imaging methods (CT, TEE, NMR). In this case report, we describe a 36-year-old patient, who suffered rupture of the thoracic aorta in the isthmus region during a car accident. CT was suspicious of aortic rupture and the exact localization of the rupture site was visualized by TEE. It was confirmed during the operation when an aortic prothesis was implanted. The high mortality of aortic rupture could possibly be lowered by early application of TEE. Preoperative angiography seems not to be necessary.
