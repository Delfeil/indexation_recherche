Malformations of the urinary tract are one of the most common types of anomalies in the neonatal period. Approximately 15-20% of all prenatally detected malformations  require acute postnatal imaging. Sonography is the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of nephro-urologic problems in infancy. Hydronephrosis represents the most common pathology, followed by multicystic-dysplastic kidney. Discussion: The result of the sonographic examination directs further imaging. An adequate diagnostic algorithm is decisive  for accurate diagnosis, for the appropriate therapeutic regimen and for the prognosis  of the patients.
