A 36-year old woman was presented to our hospital with congenital ventricular septal defect and one-vessel coronary artery disease (75% proximal left main coronary artery) for CABG and repair of the VSD. After induction, a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) baseline examination was performed, showing a severely dilated coronary sinus (CS) measuring approximately 3 cm (abnormal >1 cm). We suggested a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) draining into the CS. PLSVC is a common venous congenital anomaly, with a reported incidence of 0.5% in general population and in 3-5 % of patients with congenital heart defect. Injection of echo-contrast solution in a left arm vein, visualizing microbubbles passing through the PLSVC into the CS confirmed our suspicion. The diagnosis of a PLSVC and dilated CS is a contraindication for retrograde cardioplegia because of the loss of cardioplegia into the PLSVC resulting in a inadequate myocardial protection. It may be difficult to pass a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) through a left internal or left subclavian vein and it may be associated with arrythmias. A chest radiograph shows the anomalous course of the PAC along the left heart.
