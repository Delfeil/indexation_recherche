We studied the relationship between vocational changes, stresses and psychosomatic complaints in aging patients. In a follow-up study all patients of the Psychosomatic Hospital Bad Neustadt/Saale (Rehabilitation) were assessed at intake and at discharge. 158 older patients (50-59 years) were compared to 97 younger patients (30-39 years) and 157 patients between 40 and 49 years based on standardized and newly developed questionnaires for psychosomatic complaints and vocational stresses. Older patients were less distressed at admission and more satisfied with their lives in general. They reported more vocational changes and dissatisfaction and were more pessimistic about returning to work. The introduction of new computer technologies and the change of their supervisor were experienced as particularly threatening. They responded with more negative work attitudes and heightened distress. Therapeutic strategies are exemplified by the reduction of the fear of the work with computers.
