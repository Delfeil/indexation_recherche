Sézary syndrome is the leukemic and erythrodermic form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Since 1987 extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP) has been available for treatment of erythrodermic CTCL in the USA. Through a group of case reports, we want to emphasize ECP as the treatment of choice for erythrodermic CTCL.
