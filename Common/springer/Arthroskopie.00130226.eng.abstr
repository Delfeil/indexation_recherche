Fixation of SLAP II lesions are often difficult because the posterior-superior part of the labrum does not allow good visualization of the glenoid. With our technique, we pass a suture through a needle which is placed in the supraspinous fossa. The suture is tied over the anterior-superior portal and drawn back through the fossa. Visualization of the posterior-superior glenoid is now allowed and the suture anchor can be placed precisely.
