Patients: We report on four infants with nonketotic hyperglycinemia, three with a neonatal form and one with the milder infantile form. Despite early diagnosis and persistent therapy including dextromethorphan and sodium benzoate, two infants with the neonatal form deteriorated progressively and died at the age of 16 and 50 months, respectively, only one survived severely retarded with seizures, opisthotonus and spastic quadriplegia. The serum concentrations of glycine decreased following sodium benzoate treatment but cerebrospinal fluid/serum glycine ratio remained elevated with no improvement in clinical outcome. The patient with the infantile form has been treated for over three years with dextromethorphan, and is now a severely retarded child without seizure activity and continuous psychomotor development.
