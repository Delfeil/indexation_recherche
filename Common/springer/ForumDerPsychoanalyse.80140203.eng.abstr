 The alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process. The historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts, these being the implicit "standard alliance" of Freud, Zetzel's therapeutic alliance and Greenson's working alliance, are to be described. All alliance concepts refer to a general, essentially reality-oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain, which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work. Nonetheless, the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference. The alliances are therefore not faced with the transference, but rather with the resistance.
