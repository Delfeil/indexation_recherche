To compare the efficacy of digital rectal examination (DRE) and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in early detection of prostate cancer, we initiated a prospective multicenter screening trial. In 12 542 men choosen at random with a mean age of 62 (  +/-  7.5) a suspect DRE or a PSA level > 4.0 ng/ml was found in 2343 (20 %). Of the presently performed 744 biopsies, 157 revealed diagnosis of prostate cancer. Although further biopsies as well as the follow up of the 12 542 men are still missing, combination of DRE and PSA value > 4.0 ng/ml appears to be superior to DRE alone with a positive predictive value of 50 % versus 19 % in early detection of prostate cancer.
