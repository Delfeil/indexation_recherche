Abstract  A rare cause of painful swelling of the knee cavity can be an aneurysm of the popliteal vein. Only 28 cases are reported in the literature. We treated a 20-year-old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies, one operation and one MRI; finally, phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins. To avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed. Twelve months after the operation the patient is free of symptoms with a patent autograft.
