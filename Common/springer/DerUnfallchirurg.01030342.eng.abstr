There are no clear definitions of serious or complex hand injuries in the literature. Multistructural injuries involving a vital risk to the affected part of the body part are usually classified as complex. The quality of the reconstruction, based on sound management principles, determines the aesthetic and functional outcome for the patient. The strategies basically consist of: Careful radical dèbridement, thorough analysis of the defect and evaluation of lost functions, injury classification, Patient oriented reconstructive procedures, careful and realistic explanation of perspectives and risks to the patient. Following these principles will most likely achieve the planned objectives of treatment, such as, best possible restoration of form and function, cost-effective therapy, and early professional and social reintegration. Algorithmic approaches are an important aid in the clinical approach to these kinds of problems, making it possible to reach clear reproducible decisions that are amenable to standardization. Despite all individual decisions necessary to achieve optimal care, this standard theoretical framework will be able to improve the quality of care.
