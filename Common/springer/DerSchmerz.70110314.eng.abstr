Chronic pain has a variety of causes. Therefore patients with chronic pain should be treated in an interdisciplinary way. From a psychological point of view a cognitive-behavioral approach is preferred. This includes training for coping with pain as well as the added option of a comprehensive psychotherapy. This form of treatment seems to be indicated in most cases, but it is not suitable if the patient does not agree with the procedure, preferring instead a special kind of therapy which is not cognitive-behavioral. On the other hand a psychological treatment is not indicated if the therapist is not prepared to cooperate with other therapists in an interdisciplinary fashion.
