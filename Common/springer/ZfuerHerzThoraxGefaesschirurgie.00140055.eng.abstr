 A floppy mitral valve is characterized by dilatation of the valve annulus, abnormal enlargement of the leaflet and elongation of chordae. This leads to prolapse of the leaflet in the atrium which consequently causes mitral valve insufficiency. Considered from an anatomic-pathological point of view, there is myxoid degeneration of the valve. Between April 1986 and June 1995 mitral valve reconstruction has been performed on 531 patients, whereby 171 (103 men, 68 women; meang age: 55.8 years) presented with mitral insufficiency caused by a floppy valve. In 141 cases reconstruction consisted solely of plication plasty with the Gerbode technique or in combination with strengthened through pericardial strip plasty or annuloplasty using the Paneth technique. The remaining reconstructions were more complex and included, among other techniques, shortening or transposing the chordae. Implants were not used in any of the cases. Early mortality was 1.7% (3 patients). Survival at two, five and eight years was 91, 86 and 82%, respectively. During the early postoperative period seven patients (4%) required mitral valve replacement due to a new chordal rupture or breakdown of the reconstruction plasty. During the follow-up period (range: 1-108 months/mean 45.2 months) 13 further valve replacements were made while two patients again underwent valve reconstruction. Postoperative echocardiographic examinations indicated no mitral insufficiency in 38% of the patients, negligible insufficiency in 35.0% and moderate insufficiency in 23%. Based on clinical observations 89% of the patients were assigned NYHA class I or II (preoperatively 75% were in Class III or IV). Mitral valve reconstruction for floppy mitral valves showed acceptable early and intermediate results even without the use of rigid or flexible implants.
