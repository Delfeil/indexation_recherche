Background: Orbitotomies have special place in ophthalmic surgery because of the anatomical structures involved and the variety of perioperative problems. We performed a retrospective analysis of orbitotomies carried out in our department in order to give us some more detailed information about the frequency and extent of the various intra- and postoperative problems of orbital surgery.
