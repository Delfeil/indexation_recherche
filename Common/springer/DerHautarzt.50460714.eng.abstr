Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, a relatively rare, distinctive eruption occurring after hepatitis B infection, is characterized by a lichenoid papular exanthema, usually localized on the face, limbs, and buttocks. Hepatitis B antigenaemia is associated with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome only in some cases. Recent reports indicate that a variety of infectious agents are associated with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. This is a report of 21/2-year-old girl with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome and concurrent primary Epstein-Barr virus infection without evidence of hepatitis B infection.
