The endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way. Between 1 October 1994 and 7 May 1995, 46 patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on 55 hands were documented in a prospective study. The following results were taken from a questionnaire. There were not any complaints, or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in 51 of 55 cases. There were continuing complaints in four cases, and after an additional check two patients were operated on again. The advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative disablement. No complications have occurred.
