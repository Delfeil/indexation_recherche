A case report is given to draw attention to the risk of the occurence of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) under the anticonvulsant tiagabine in higher doses and dosis increases. The patient who had no previous history of status epilepticus developed several NCSE shortly after administration of tiagabine. This represents strong evidence of a causal relationship. Also, in experimental studies it has been shown that in higher doses a disequilibrium between glial and neuronal GABA uptake may aggravate the failure of GABA inhibition thus explaining this adverse side-effect.
