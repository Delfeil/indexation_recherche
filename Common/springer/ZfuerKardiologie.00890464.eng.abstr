 We present the case of a 67 year old woman who was resuscitated due to cardiac tamponade. Examination of the pus fluid showed a bacterial infection with streptococcus milleri. Four days before resuscitation the patient experienced weakness, dyspnoe, increased temperature (39 ° C), swelling of the neck, and pain on swallowing. Using computed tomography, examination revealed an infection extending from the right tonsil to the mediastinum and into the pericardium. After surgery to remove the retropharyngeal abscess, the patient healed well. Therefore, on presentation of a cardiac tamponade, possible hematogenous or lymmphogenous causes or per continuitatem infections should always be considered. In this case the germs in the fluid and the typical patient history indicated an oropharyngeal reason.
