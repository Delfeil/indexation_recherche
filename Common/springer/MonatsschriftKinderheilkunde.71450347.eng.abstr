Three children with primary, nonfamilial hypoparathyreoidism presented with high-grade sensorineural deafness. Based on clinical and molecular evidence, one could be diagnosed as Kearns-Sayre syndrome. The basis of the association in the other cases remains unclear. The combination of symptoms seems to be more frequent than peviously assumed, affecting 3 of 9 children treated at our clinic because of primary, nonfamilial hypoparathyreoidism.  Genetically determined dysfunction of cochlear haircell motility and haircell damage as consequence of reduced calcium concentrations in peri- and endolymph are discussed as pathogenetic factors of sensorineural deafness in cases of hypoparathyreoidism. Two of the children showed a marked renal dysplasia. Similar familial cases with associated kidney malformations have been reported in the literatur, indicating the possibiliy of a common cause for hypoparathyreoidism, sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia. Discussion: As a practical consequence of our experience we recommend laboratory investigations (i. e. parathyreoid hormone) in order to exclude an underlying hypoparathyreoidism in patients with sensorineural deafness. Vice versa, an audiogram should be performed in patients with idiopathic hypoparathyreoidism for early recognition and treatment of associated sensorineural deafness.
