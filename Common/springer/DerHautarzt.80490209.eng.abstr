Sweating (perspiratio sensibilis) due to cholinergic sweat gland activity serves predominantly for thermoregulation and is triggered among others by physical stress. Individuals suffering from atopic eczema usually respond to sweating with generalized itching. Different sweat regulation in atopic patients and healthy controls under cholinergic stimulation and heat chamber provocation tests has already been examined in several studies. However, no clinical trial has yet been done on atopic sweat regulation during physical stress. Sex-specific sweat secretion rates have not been evaluated. In our trial we compared sweat amounts of male and female atopics (14 m, 10 f) and healthy controls (14 m, 10 f) during and after physical activity on a bicycle ergometer. We used a special sweat collector system reliable even at intensive body movement. The individual stress limit had been determined by previous endurance training with lactate level and heart rate measurement. We found a highly significant difference in maximum sweat amounts between atopics and controls. On average, healthy individuals (of both sexes) perspired nearly three times as much as atopic patients. Male controls perspired nearly twice as much as corresponding females. Among the atopics, sex-specific differences were found to be not statistically relevant.
