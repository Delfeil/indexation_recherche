 The polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx is a rare disease. Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma is a minor salivary gland neoplasm which occurs frequently in the mucosa of the soft and hard palates, in the buccal mucosa and in the upper lip. To date this entity has been identified within the oral cavity and only one case within the nasopharynx and some cases in the parotid gland. It has a slow infiltrating growing pattern with frequent perineural invasion and low metastatic potential.  We report on a patient with non-papillary polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma in the nasopharynx which extended intracranially. The patient underwent primary radiotherapy. The CT showed partial response to radiotherapy and the patients is alive 51 months after the diagnosis his state being unchanged.   The treatment for minor salivary gland tumor is primarily surgical. It is reported that the polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma has been known to have poor response to radiotherapy. However, we believe that in addition to its favorable biological behavior, the radiotherapy in this localization may result in longer survival.
