We treated a large superficial basal cell carcinoma (ca. 10x6 cm) on the right breast in a 48-year old woman with photodynamic terapy (PDT). Fractionated PDT was performed by topical application of -aminolevulinic acid (-ALA, 20%) with subsequent red light (570-750 nm; 180 J/cm2) in three sessions. Nearly total remission of the tumor resulted; however, a few residual neoplastic islands partly infiltrating the nipple-areola complex could be detected by photodynamic diagnosis (PDD). These fluorescent areas were marked, excised, and the defect was closed by a rotation advancement flap. Total excision of the tumor was verified histologically. By combining PDT and surgery, this large tumor was treated with excellent cosmetic results. This case demonstrates the efficiency of topical PDT with adjunctive plastic surgery controlled by PDD even in large tumors.
