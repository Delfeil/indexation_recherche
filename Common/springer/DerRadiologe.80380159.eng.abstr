The concept of MR guidance of invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures is based on the excellent morphologic and functional properties of MR imaging. Prerequisites are adequate patient monitoring and adherence to safety guidelines. Fast and ultrafast sequences, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular devices, thermal stability of contrast media and thermosensitive contrast media are discussed. The spectrum of clinical applications includes biopsies, thermal ablation modalities, vascular applications, MR endoscopy and intraoperative MR imaging. The development of interventional MR imaging is still in its infancy. In the future, MR imaging may play an important role in interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
