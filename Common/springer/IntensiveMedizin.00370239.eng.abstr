 Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an infection-triggered, immune-mediated demyelinating inflammation of the peripheral nerves. It often requires treatment in an intensive care unit because of progressive weakness with impairment of respiratory muscle function and involvement of the autonomic nervous system leading to life-threatening dysautonomia. The discernment and prophylaxis of complications in due time needs special expenditure of nursing care. Clinical state, the vital capacity, and blood gases have to be observed regularly to discern the need of intubation and mechanical ventilation (up to 25% of the patients). Dysautonomia may cause blood pressure fluctuations with severe hypertension or hypotension as well as severe tachycardias or bradycardias so that continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, frequent measurements of blood pressure, and readiness for cardiopulmonary resuscitation including transcutaneous demand pacing are recommended. Tetraplegic and therefore immobilized patients are at risk for several complications that can be prevented by adequate nursing, positioning, mobilization, chest physiotherapy, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis. If cranial nerves are involved, the danger of dysphagia and aspiration has to be taken into account, enteral nutrition may require a nasogastric or nasoduodenal probe. Dysautonomia often includes impairment of bladder and intestinal functions, which therefore have to be controlled regularly and to be supported if necessary. Nursing of the alert teraplegic GBS patient needs special empathy and should include psychological support; the desire for pharmacological anxiolysis, sedation or pain relief also has to be taken into account. Besides specific therapeutic measures such as intravenous immunoglobulin or/and plasmapheresis, adequate nursing care can contribute significantly to improve the outcome of patients with GBS.
