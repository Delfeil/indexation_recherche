Primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is burdened by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma, especially in conjunction with craniocerebral or thoracic trauma. This also applies to unreamed medullary nailing. Primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure, the timing of which is not predictable. Plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure, but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation. In a prospective study conducted from 1 September 1994 to 30 June 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients (average ISS: 30 points), simple femoral stem fractures (A-1 to B-3 of the AO-classification) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique. While cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone, a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression. At least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate. This allows micro-movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue. All of the fractures were immediately stabilized on the day of the accident.
