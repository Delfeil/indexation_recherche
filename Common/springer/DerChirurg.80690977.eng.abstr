 The iliac artery-ureteral fistula is a rare complication which becomes symptomatic with life-endangering bleeding. A typical feature is its intermittent occlusion, which makes diagnosis very difficult. Without knowledge of the correct diagnosis the rate of morbidity, through functional loss of the kidneys, and of mortality can be extremely high. In the following a case is described in which, after radiotherapy and chemotherapy following sigmoid resection due to carcinoma, urinary congestion of the remaining functional kidney occurred during the course of treatment. Following the placing of an endoureteral stent an iliac-ureteral fistula with massive bleeding developed. It was demonstrated by means of angiography. For the first time, therapy with endoluminal stent grafts was successfully applied.
