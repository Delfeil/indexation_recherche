Abstract.  A man presented with 100% immotile spermatozoa. Transmission electron microscopy showed the absence of both central tubules in all sperm tails; the nine peripheral tubules, dynein arms, radial spokes and other structures of the sperm tail were normal. Immotile cilia syndrome of the 9+0 tubular pattern was diagnosed. Other anomalies frequently associated with immotile cilia syndrome, such as recurrent airway infections, bronchiectases and situs inversus (Kartagener's syndrome), were not present in this case.
