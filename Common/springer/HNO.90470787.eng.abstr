Category loudness scaling was used to investigate the loudness perception of 31 patients with a cochlear hearing loss (Group 1) by comparing the results with those found in 15 patients with retro-cochlear hearing loss caused by an acoustic neuroma (Group 2). Narrow-band noise signals at four different frequencies (0.5 to 4.0 kHz) were used. In the cochlear hearing-impaired subjects the slopes of the level-loudness functions tended to increase with increasing hearing loss, indicating positive recruitment, whereas the much shallower slopes associated with retro-cochlear lesions were presumed to reflect negative recruitment. The graphic representation of the iso-loudness functions revealed a different dynamic range between Group 1 and 2 with the ability to discriminate small differences of stimulus levels reduced in the presence of an acoustic neuroma. Category loudness scaling has been shown to be a valuable tool describing the individual perception of sound in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Furthermore, the method can be employed as an indicator of recruitment without any restrictive preconditions. For this reason the categorial loudness scaling can be a desirable method for supplementing the audiological diagnosis of a retro-cochlear hearing impairment through the frequency-specific description of a usable hearing-field and its dynamic range.
