Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is standard therapy for urolithiasis. With comparable technical principles, various lithotripters have been developed and are in routine use. Renal pelvic stones, calyceal stones, ureteral stones, and other special forms can be treated with varying results. Currently, the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the recurrence of calculi are under discussion. Whereas the side effects of ESWL are well known, studies comparing ESWL with other endourological procedures are still lacking.
