Since the communication of McCarthy et al. in 1992, applications for distraction osteogenesis in the maxillofacial complex have increased enormously. The advantages as compared to conventional reconstructive procedures are missing donor-site morbidity for bone graft harvesting, reduced blood loss and also a gradual gain in the soft tissue envelope. Meanwhile, even the vertical lengthening of the alveolar process has become a clinically reliable method. The case presented illustrates the treatment of a 16-year-old patient who suffered a sporting accident at the age of 7 years, leading to ankylosis of the upper middle incisors with subsequent underdevelopment of the frontal alveolar process. After fabrication of a custom-made distraction device, an osteotomy of the tooth-bearing segment in the upper front was performed and the segment was attached to the distraction device. Bone lengthening was started on the seventh postoperative day at a daily rate of 0.5 mm. The distraction was maintained until closure of the open bite was achieved. On the 22nd day, the segment was fixed using an orthodontic arch wire and the distraction device was removed. A retention period of 6 weeks was maintained until sufficient stability was detectable. Now, 1.5 years after the treatment, the situation is stable with a good consolidation of the bone fragments and a physiologically shaped gingivobuccal sulcus. Lengthening of the alveolar process by vertical distraction osteogenesis using a tooth-borne device may be indicated in certain cases. With this technique a second operation can be avoided and there is less risk of laceration of dental roots by fixation screws.
