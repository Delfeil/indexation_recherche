 As a result of physical violence to exposed regions of skin (beating, grabbing) it was possible to effect a mutual transfer of epithelial cells between probands. The majority of these cells were corneocytes with a minimal incidence of nucleated stratum granulosum cells. Punching onto foil-covered sandbags resulted in a comparable transfer of cells. Punches afflicted to the upper arms resulted in a successful `perpetrator-victim' assignment via DNA typing. The DNA did not only originate from the few nucleated cells but also from the corneocytes themselves, as positively confirmed by investigations of denucleated cell-suspensions. The cell concentration achieved in model experiments, however, shows that the forensic value of such a sample is dependent on the presence of nucleated cells. The results of this paper justify the requirement - (having weighed up the appropriate case-specific modalities) - that sampling by taking swabs of the skin regions in question must be carried out as soon as possible.
