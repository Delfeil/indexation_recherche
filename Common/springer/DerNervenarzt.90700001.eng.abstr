In children and adolescents motor/vocal tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior are known to be closely related. Thereby, a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics/rituals/obsessive-compulsive traits to clinically relevant obsessions and compulsions could be described. As neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits (sensorimotor circuit in tic symptomatology, orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive-compulsive behavior) were postulated. For both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to counterregulate tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior, respectively, and psychopharmacological agents can be administerd to compensate dysbalances in neurotransmitter systems. In case of a mixed symptomatologic picture it is necessary to include interventions for both pols of the symptom-continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient.
