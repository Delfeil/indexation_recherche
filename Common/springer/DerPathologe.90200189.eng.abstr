Multiple and bilateral oncocytomas are rare. There are only ten cases that have been previously described. Three of these displayed multiple and bilateral oncocytomas and microoncocytomas, a so-called oncocytomatosis. This report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy. In addition, we found an adrenal adenoma, a pheochromocytoma and thoracic cicatrices 4 years after curatively resected large cell carcinoma of the lung. In the distal renal tubules we found oncocytic epithelial cells, with partial transition into microoncocytomas. Immunhistochemically, these and the main oncocytomas were CD 10 negative. These findings support the origin of oncocytoma from oncocytically transformed distal tubular epithelium. CGH analysis of the different tumors revealed no common cytogenetic changes. Coexistence of renal oncocytoma with other tumors is rare. Hitherto, coexistence of a renal oncocytomatosis with multiple tumors has not been described.
