Pyoderma gangraenosum is a rare, chronic type of skin ulceration of unknown aetiology. It occasionally appears following trauma. There are no set standards for the treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum. It is essential to consider acuteness of progression as well as underlying systemic diseases and possible drug side effects before initiating a therapy. Immunosuppressive as well as immunomodulating agents are most often used, with varying degrees of success. We report a 45-year-old patient who suffered from an extensive posttraumatic pyoderma gangraenosum after cardiac bypass operation. With short-term combination therapy consisting of high dose intravenous immunoglobulins and systemic corticosteroids, the progression of the disease could be stopped within a few days.
