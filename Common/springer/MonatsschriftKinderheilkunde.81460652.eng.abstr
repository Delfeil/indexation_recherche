Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most frequent inborn error of metabolism of the urea cycle which causes severe hyperammonemia in hemizygous boys within the first days of life.

Enclosed are the details about the allopurinol challenge test for the detection of heterozygous women and girls.
