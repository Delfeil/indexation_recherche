The dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency-dependent. To date, this has still not been fully investigated or understood. There remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution. The presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser-Doppler vibrometry at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens. Motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical equations. Using a sound stimulus, the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured, and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by Fourier transform. Results were used for verification of the computer models. In the current investigations these models were refined and allow for the detailed investigation of the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain, facilitating the optimal design of passive and active middle-ear implants.
