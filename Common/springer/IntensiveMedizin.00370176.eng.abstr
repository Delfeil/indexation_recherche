Abstract The term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea, cough, and count or purulence of sputum. The management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management, hospital management or intensive care treatment. Cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors. The first-line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug-treatment with 2-agonists and anticholinergics. Systemic steroids as a short-term course are advocated if hospital-treatment is necessary. Infections of the respiratory tract are a frequent cause of acute exacerbations. However, a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state. Antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present. The severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms. This should be borne in mind for the choice of the antimicrobiotic treatment. Noninvasive ventilation in severe exacerbation is able to improve gas-exchange and to reduce the work of breathing. As a consequence the number of intubations and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced. If invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary, the potential of dynamic hyperinflation in acute exacerbation has to be considered.
