In Germany of the pre-war period Ernest Vaubel at Wiesbaden was the most emminent arthroscopist. He collaborated with the manufacturer Georg Wolf at Berlin and developed his own arthroscope, a jacobaeus-type thoracolaparascope with a 45  °-optic and an in- and outflow connecting piece. The optic was definitely longer than the trocard and the electric bulb at the tip was in danger during manipulation in a narrow joint. - Vaubel did a rather small series of arthroscopies from 1936 to 1939 at the University hospitals of Leipzig and Frankfurt, using local anaesthesia and air medium. 1938 he held a paper at the International Congress of Rheumatologists at Bath. In the same year he published a monograph titled "Die Arthroskopie", the first book of world literature on this issue. 1939 he leaved the Frankfurt university hospital and went in his own private practice. 1941-1944 he did military service as medical officer of the air force. After war he hadn't more facilities to practice arthroscopy. - His ideas and his instrument were revived in the german speaking countries in the late fifties by the sports surgeons Gottwald Heiss at Stuttgart and Reinhold Suckert at Linz.
