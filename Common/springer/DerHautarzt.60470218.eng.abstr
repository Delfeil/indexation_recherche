In this paper we present two patients with T-cell lymphomas, who presented with unique skin lesions, but later developed extracutaneous involvement. The first patient showed marked edematous infiltration of the trunk and legs as well as grouped, umbilicated red-to-blue papules limited to the body folds. The second patient had lesions reminiscent of poikiloderma vasculare atrophicans, with erythema, teleangiectasia, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, and bizarre scarring, followed by development of papules and nodules. The first patient also had marked leukocytosis and lymph node enlargement. Histology, immunohistology, and immunophenotyping revealed an unclassifiable CD8+, ,+, CD10+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with leukemic involvement. Unclassifiable cutaneous T-cell lymphoma was also diagnosted in the second patient: it was associated with a monoclonal proliferation of T-cell receptor V9,+ large granular T lymphocytes and finally developed into frank, acute pre-T lymphatic leukemia.
