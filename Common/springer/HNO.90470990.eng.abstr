We report our experience in managing a temporal bone fracture after head trauma that had no apparent clinical signs. Recurrent CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures. Operative exploration of the temporal bone demonstrated a fracture line along the horizontal part of the carotid artery. The location of the fracture did not cause such typical symptoms as hearing impairment, facial paralysis, vertigo or tinnitus. Only CSF liquorrhea through the Eustachian tube indicated a fracture at the lateral skull base.
