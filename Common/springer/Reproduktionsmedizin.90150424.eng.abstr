Knowledge of the biology of progesterone and progesterone receptors has increased tremendously over the past decade. The range of progesterone receptor modulators, including agonists and full antagonists, has been extended. Thus, the great potential of medical uses, ranging from the treatment of specific diseases such as hormone-dependent cancer and endometriosis to post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy and to new methods in fertility regulation, has been made possible. Early research on progesterone receptor modulators focused on abortion, and this application received much attention by the media and pressure groups. This obscured the non-abortion uses, and both real and perceived barriers have slowed down the development of these agents. Given continuing research and development, it is very likely that progesterone receptor modulators will contribute significantly to improvements in the health of both women and men. Because of these beneficial effects on health, it is unethical not to continue to conduct scientifically sound medical research in this area. Physicians and scientists, including representatives of academia, organizations involved in medical research and the pharmaceutical industry, who attended the Symposium on Progesterone, Progestins and Antiprogestins in the Next Millennium held in Jerusalem, Israel, on 31 August to 3 September 1999, are calling for continuing intensive research and development in the field of progesterone receptor modulators.
