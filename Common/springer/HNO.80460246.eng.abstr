Learning microsurgery of the middle ear requires preparations of temporal bones. Ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult. Due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities, the manufacture of facsimiles up to now has been impossible. Rapid prototyping techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one. By using CT scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3D pictures on a CAD workstation. We are now able to incorporate data in a stereolithographic system to create an anatomic facsimile of the temporal bone. It is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object. With this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching, training and research. Our artificial preparations of temporal bones correspond to both the material characteristics and anatomic details of human structures, allowing various surgical exercises to be carried out.
