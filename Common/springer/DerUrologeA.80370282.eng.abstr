1493 patients were enrolled in 55 centers in Europe, Canada, Australia and the USA comparing the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in daily doses of 2 and 3 g with placebo/azathioprine (PLA/AZA) for the prevention of acute rejection in renal transplant patients. Acute rejections and graft loss and death at 1 year were measured per trial and these data were combined and analyzed in a pooled fashion. The three pooled treatment groups were well balanced regarding demographic characteristics and cause of renal failure leading to transplantation. At one year the graft survival rate was 90.4 % and 89.2 % in the MMF 2 g and 3 g groups compared with 87.6 % in the PLA/AZA-group. MMF 2 and 3 g were significantly better than PLA/AZA in reducing biopsy proven rejection at one year: 40.8 % placebo/aza vs. 19.8 % in the MMF 2 g group and 16.5 % in the MMF 3 g group.
