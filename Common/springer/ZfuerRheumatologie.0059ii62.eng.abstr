 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood, especially IL-6, but also IL-1 and TNF, for example, in different concentrations, depending on disease activity. A disturbed circadian rhytm of cortisol secretion and an overall elevated cortisol release in active RA, depending on disease activity, is known.
