 The author investigates the relationships between the concept of functional pleasure as defined by Fenichel and some other psychoanalytic concepts. It is argued that in the realization of formations of repressed genital-sexual drive-wishes the erogenic pleasure which is intended changes into a functional pleasure in which successful defense can be subjectively experienced. At the beginning of a sexual interaction there is an anxiety whether it is possible to keep the repressed wishes with their substitutes out of consciousness. The pleasure-unpleasure-principle as defined by Freud is read as an unpleasure-functional pleasure-principle which is only valid for the realization of substitutes of the repressed. Furthermore the reasons for a solution of the oedipus complex as put forward by Freud are rejected and sublimations are understood as the result of different defense mechanisms which lead to substitutes of the repressed which are in accordance with society and the ego of an individual.
