 Acute exacerbation of COPD is most often caused by pulmonary infections. This may necessitate support by mechanical ventilation (non-invasively via nasal or face mask or invasively via endotracheal tube). For ventilation settings and strategy, a profound understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms is mandatory. The main principles are reducing dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation, decreasing work of breathing by reduction of obstructive load, and avoiding patient-ventilator dyscoordination. Careful and repeated adjustment of the ventilator settings is mandatory. After the acute phase, the weaning process has to be initiated as early as possible.
