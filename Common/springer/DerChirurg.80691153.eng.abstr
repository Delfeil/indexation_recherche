 Basically, four post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be improved by corrective osteotomies: recurring luxations and subluxations of the hip joint; necrosis of the femoral head; non-unions; deformities. Dependent on the individual situation, the following procedure can be recommended, including diagnosis of deformities and indication and therapy of corrective osteotomies: analysis of the problem from the viewpoint of history, clinical findings and imaging techniques; indication for corrective osteotomy; graphic planning; operation technique. Particularities of post-traumatic conditions with regard to diagnosis, indication and surgical technique are indicated. Only with perfectly tailored concepts can we respond to the individual situation of an individual patient and reflect the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur.
