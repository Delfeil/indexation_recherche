  The leading pathophysiology of acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock is acute or subacute myocardial infarction. Reperfusion of the occluded coronary vessel accompanied by adequate support of cardiac function via assist systems, preferentially the intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, is the therapy of choice. Adjustment of preload (high pulmonary capillary pressure in acute myocardial infarction with small heart, low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with large ventricles and chronic heart failure, high central venous pressure in patients with right heart failure, and right ventricle myocardial infarction) and afterload (peripheral arterial vasodilatation, recommended systolic arterial pressure 80-90 mm Hg) but not maximization of cardiac output play an important role. Positive inotropic drugs should be considered when these strategies fail. In acute right heart failure in pulmonary hypertension, a preferential pulmonary vasodilatation with intravenous or inhalative prostaglandins or inhalative NO are of utmost importance. Systemic hypotension is not a contraindication in this pathophysiology.
