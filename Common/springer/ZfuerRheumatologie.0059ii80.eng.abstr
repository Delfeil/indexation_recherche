 We investigated the relationships between prolactin (PRL) levels and antibody occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). No significant association between PRL levels and the majority of the autoantibodies studied (anti-U1 RNP, anti-rRNP, anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, anti-DNP, auto-LCA, anti-EACA) could be confirmed (P > 0.05), anti-Ro/SSA antibodies being an exception. Our results showed significantly increased frequencies of these antibodies in the group of female SLE patients with normal PRL levels (< 20 µg/L): anti Ro/SSA in 53% (P < 0.025, 2 = 5.80, RR = 4.0) and anti-Ro/SSA + anti-Ro/La in 60% (P < 0.05, 2 = 4.05) compared with female SLE patients with hyperprolactinemia.
