Sexological time diagnoses indicate a dramatic cultural change of sexuality, a "neosexual revolution". In this paper, some symptoms leading to this diagnosis will be summarized, e.g. changes in sexual values, a dissolution of sex differences and differences in sexual orientation as well as changes of relationships. All these phenomena must influence psychotherapy, especially the treatment of sexual problems. The potential consequences of the cultural change for psychotherapy is discussed in this review related to "new" disorders, the importance of sexual violence and traumatization, medicalisation of sexuality, and psychoanalytic theory.
