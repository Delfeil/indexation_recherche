  The success of interventional catheter based therapy of coronary artery disease is still limited by a high rate of chronic restenosis. Using alternative mechanical techniques, there is increasing evidence that restenosis can be prevented in certain subsets of patients by optimized balloon angioplasty, DCA and stenting as well as by the combined approach of primary tissue removal with adjunctive stent implantation. This article summarizes the mechanical techniques of restenosis prevention or reduction that have been documented in controlled trials. Additional pharmacologic interventions and possibly genetic and/or radiotherapeutic approaches will be highly important for future reduction of restenosis.
