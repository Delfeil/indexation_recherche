The use of resorbable osteosynthesis materials spares the need for metallic implants and second operative procedures, which are often necessary, to remove the material. Appropriate substances are polymers and copolymers of glycolic and lactic acid. In a literature review, material characteristics, their degradation, and applications in animal experiments and clinical studies are presented. Particularly, the possible reasons of foreign body reactions occurring during the degradation period and material-related difficulties in practical use are discussed. It is evident that the use of low crystalline or amorphous polymers with in vivo long-lasting strength offers a secure and uncomplicated healing of fractures. Therefore, in future these substances will be an interesting alternative to common metallic osteosynthesis materials.
