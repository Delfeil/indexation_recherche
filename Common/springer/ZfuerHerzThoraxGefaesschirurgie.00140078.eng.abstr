 Thirty two patients with 82 aortocoronary vein grafts and 23 mammaria interna grafts were interviewed 24 +/- 7 months postoperatively and their symptoms were classified according to NYHA and CCS. To determine graft patency, electron beam tomography (EBCT) was used, which was performed 27 +/- 8 months postoperatively. In 16 patients at least one graft was occluded, and in only 2 of these patients was there a clinical deterioration when compared with the preoperative status (2/16: sensitivity: 12%). No clinical deterioration occurred in the group without graft occlusion (16/16: specificity 100%). The conclusion of the study was that coronary graft occlusion on the one hand is rarely accompanied by clinical symptoms, but on the other hand if there were clinical symptoms graft occlusion was present.
