The complex injury is characterized by a fracture and/or dislocation of the elbow in association with a serial injury of the upper extremity, or a severe soft tissue trauma , or a prolonged ischemia caused by vascular injury or compartment syndrom. They are defined as complex injuries because their treatment differs from that of a simple fracture implying that standardized concepts usually cannot be employed. The results of primary treatement show a high rate of complications. They are accompanied by functional deficits including pseudarthrosis and ankylosis. As a consequence, ulnar neuropathy may occur. Inadequate treatment leads to delayed rehabilitation and several secondary operations. The main goal points at the reconstruction of the elbow joint to restore function. Therefore, the logistical pathway of individual therapy is the key for success. The operation has to include fracture stabilisation of all injuries of the upper extremity. Only stable osteosynthesis makes early mobilisation possible. Transfixation of the elbow joint should be reserved for exceptional cases. The principals of AO have proven to be practical both for the distal humerus and the proximal forearm. Successful reconstruction of the elbow joint often demands extended approaches. ORIF of the proximal ulna can be achieved by indirect reposition techniques. Dynamic stabilisation should be established by conservation of the radial head and coronoid process. For treatment of soft tissue injury it is necessary to undertake local reconstructive measures. Operative treatment is widely indicated for forearm compartment syndrom. Diagnosis and therapy of possible accompanying vascular injury should be made early to avoid prolonged ischemia. Operative treatement of nerve injury is only indicated in case of sharp dissection of the nerve. Otherwise the reconstruction should be performed, but not earlier than three months. Rehabilitation outcome depends on primary therapy. Sufficient functional results are only achieved after early mobilisation and intensive physiotherapy. If necessary, arthrolysis is planned early and combined with removal of implants at 6 months post injury.
