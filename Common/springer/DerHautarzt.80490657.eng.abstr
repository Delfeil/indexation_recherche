Glomus tumors (glomangiomata) are benign tumors arising from glomus cells. Multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant, which is usually located subungually. Nonetheless multiple glomangiomata - sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature - may cause considerable discomfort. Treatment of multiple glomangiomata is problematic because of the often large number of tumors. Sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and cryosurgical therapy. We report on sclerotherapy in a 35 year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors.
