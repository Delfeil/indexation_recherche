 We report on two patients with subcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) emphysema that developed during laparoscopic surgery with CO2 pneumoperitoneum (PP), in whom pulmonary elimination of CO2 (ECO2, Servo ventilator with integrated CO2 analyzer 930, Siemens) was continuously monitored. Patient 1 was a 61-year-old man with laparoscopic herniotomy. ECO2 immediately before PP was 120 ml/minxm2 and increased rapidly after 45 min PP to a maximum value of 340 ml/minxm2. At that time, minute ventilation had been increased from 7 to 11 l/min and PaCO2 had risen from 35 to 57 mm Hg. At the end of the procedure the patient showed excessive subcutaneous emphysema. Patient 2 was a 71-year-old woman in whom diagnostic laparoscopy was performed for staging of a pancreatic tumor. ECO2 immediately before PP was 140 ml/minxm2, increasing dramatically after 45 min PP to a maximum value of 529 ml/minxm2 (Fig. 1). At that time minute ventilation had been increased from 6.2 to 12.5 l/min and PaCO2 had risen from 40 to 77 mm Hg. PP was terminated and the patient was found to have extreme subcutaneous emphysema. She was mechanically ventilated for a further 40 min to normalize PaCO2 and ECO2. It seems reasonable to suppose that an increase in ECO2 by more than 100% of control during CO2-PP is an early sign of CO2 emphysema. In this situation hypercapnia is potentially life-threatening. Evidently, reabsorption of CO2 from loose connective tissue is far more rapid and effective than CO2 resorption from the peritoneal cavity. The incidence of CO2 emphysema during laparoscopic surgery is said to be in the range of 0.3 - 3%, but even higher incidences may be found when it is carefully looked for. Continuous observation of ECO2 is non-invasive and relatively inexpensive and may give new insights into pathophysiological changes during CO2-PP in the future.
