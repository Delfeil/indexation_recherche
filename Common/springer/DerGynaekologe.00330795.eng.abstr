Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not presently performed in Germany. According to PGD's opponents there, existing laws for the protection of embryos forbid this type of diagnostics. Proponents feel that these laws do not stand in the way of PGD, depending on legal viewpoint. This controversy has hindered PGD's application in Germany. The nature of this longstanding, emotional discussion is not easy to describe to scientists abroad.
