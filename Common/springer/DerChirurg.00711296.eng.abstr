Abstract.  The development of the modern intestinal suture began with the invagination operation, performed by the German surgeon P. F. Ramdohr in Wolfenbüttel in 1727. Today this fact is largely forgotten. Yet this operation stimulated not only Jobert de Lamballe (1824) but also Lembert (1826) to perform their animal experiments on sutures in the intestine. Also all later modifications of these suture techniques took into consideration the principle of invagination.
