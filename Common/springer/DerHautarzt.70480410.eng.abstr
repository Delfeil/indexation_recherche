A 35 year old patient developed swellings in the red colored areas of his tattoo. Histological examination revealed a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous infiltrative pattern, that could be distinguished from frank lymphoma by means of electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology. The presence of dermal dendritic cells suggests a dermal-allergic pathogenesis of non-granulomatous tattoo reactions. Therapy of choice is an excision of the inflamed areas.
