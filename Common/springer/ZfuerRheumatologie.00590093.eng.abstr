 Problem: To date, therapy of osteoarthritis of the knee is aimed at relieving pain and changing behavior patterns, which usually leads to reduced activity. The weakening of the quadricep's musculature leads to an increase in both joint instability and arthritis. Walking time is prolonged and the pain-induced reaction of knee angle velocity is onset by increased stress on other joints. The progressive muscle atrophy correlates to the degree of pain. The aim of this study was to demonstrate an improvement in strength and pain based on 4-week isokinetic strength training in gonarthritis patients.
