 Late postoperative arrhythmias are a common problem associated with significant morbidity following Fontan operations. We analyzed in our patients whether age at the time of a modified Fontan procedure (total cavopulmonary connection) has an influence on the frequency of late postoperative arrhythmias.   We examined all 66 long-term surviving patients who underwent a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) in our center during a nine year period. At the time of TCPC, 31 children were younger (group I) and 35 children were older than 4years (group II). The follow-up period was almost identical in both groups (group I: 4.29 years, group II: 4.52 years). We evaluated all ecgs performed at maximum intervals of 6 months and all Holter ecgs performed at intervals of 12 months.   Atrial tachyarrhythmias (supraventricular tachycardias, atrial flutter) were registered in six patients (9%). All of these patients belonged to group II (17%). Ventricular arrhythmias (couplets, ventricular tachycardia) were found in 3% of the younger and 17% of the older patients. Abnormalities of sinus node function were registered in equal frequency in younger and older children (group I: 35%, group II: 31%), while pauses with a duration of >2s where present only in older children (group II: 14%). Pacemaker implantation or antiarrhythmic therapy became necessary in 10/66 patients (15%) affecting none of the children who underwent the TCPC <4 years (group I) but 10/35 children (group II) who underwent the TCPC at an older age (29%).   According to our findings in the medium-term follow-up after TCPC, atrial tachyarrhythmias and complex ventricular arrhythmias are registered less frequently in children who underwent the modified Fontan procedure at an age of less than 4years. Although further studies will have to show whether these differences persist in the long-term follow-up, these findings represent an additional argument for the elective performance of modified Fontan operations at an age of less than 4 years.
