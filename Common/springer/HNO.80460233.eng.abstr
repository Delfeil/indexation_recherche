A comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens (p53, PCNA, Ki67), DNA flow-cytometry and ultrastructures of neoplastic cells from 120 cases of laryngeal cancers. Clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority (T3, 43%; T4, 18%). A 5-grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei. Positive staining was obtained in 70% for p53, 57% for Ki67 and 80% for PCNA. Sixty-two percent of the cases were DNA-diploid and 38% DNA-aneuploid. The DNA-diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei, preservation of wide margins of nuclear heterochromatin, enlargements of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei. In the aneuploid-polyploid cancers the nuclei had a substantial polymorphism, with large cleaved nuclei showing significant variations in size and having a nuclear envelope. A frequent finding was euchromatization of chromatin. Dense chromatin appeared in the form of small clumps spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei. Enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found.
