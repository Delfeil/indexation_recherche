Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is mostly found in middle aged women in skin areas exposed to sunlight. Our 17-year-old female patient had a widespread reddish-brown lesion on the abdomen that met the histological criteria for annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma. However, the clinical findings and the localization were uncommon. UV light was excluded as a trigger. Other, still unknown, factors that might change antigenicity of elastic fibres must be considered. Spontaneous resolution suggests a transient influence of such factors. Differential diagnosis includes skin disorders with elastolysis; discrimination especially from mid-dermal elastolysis is not well defined.
