Abstract.  Introduction: The aim of this literature review is to classify current knowledge on nine questions of current interest for endocrine surgery and their classification with regard to levels of evidenced-based medicine (EBM). Methods: The literature in Medline and EMBase was reviewed. Only retrospective or prospective comparative studies with statistical analysis were selected. Results: (See Table 8.) Conclusion: With respect to the current literature, only routine identification of the RLN and the minimally-invasive approach for adrenalectomy can be regarded as EBM. To answer the remaining questions prospective studies are needed.
