Background: Rocuronium is a non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent structurally related to vecuronium. The compound has a rapid onset and an intermediate duration of action. The rapid onset is of importance in patients at risk for pulmonary aspiration, for elective induction of anaesthesia slower onset properties generally are accepted. In this context, we asked whether the induction dose of rocuronium may be reduced to doses smaller than 2xED95 in situations in which slower onset properties may be acceptable.
