Dilative cardiomyopathy is characterized by dilatation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles. In childhood it has often unknown causes or is the sequela of myocarditis with or without virus persistence with or without autoimmunological components. Other causes are systemic or metabolic disorders or a previous adriblastintherapy.  Dilative cardiomyopathy is rare. It presents clinically as congestive heart failure, in a quarter of the cases there are thromboembolic complications. Diagnosis is made by echocardiography, but invasive procedures can disclose specific causes and give further therapeutic options. Therapy consists of digitalis, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors. It should be augmented by a careful -blockade and anticoagulation. Concerning the bad prognosis (1 year survival 75 %, 5 years survival 60 %) dilative cardiomyopathy is the most frequent indication for heart transplantation.
