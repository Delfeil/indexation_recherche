 Assisted mode of ventilation is often more comfortable for the patient as compared to controlled ventilation not only during weaning but also during the acute phase of ventilation. Aim of mechanical ventilation in assisted mode is to get optimal synchronisation between ventilator and patient and reduction of work of breathing. To optimize assisted mode of ventilation new techniques were developed to reduce or compensate the resistance of the tube (automatic tube compensation (ATC)). Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) allows not only to reduce resistive components of work of breathing but also to reduce elastic properties of airway mechanics of the intubated patient.
