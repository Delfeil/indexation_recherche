In this study we present morphological, cytological, immunophenotypical, and molecular genetic features of ten cases of AIDS-related primary brain lymphomas obtained as sterotactic biopsies, autopsy specimens, or cerebrospinal fluid samples. Histologically, a very characteristic perivascular and diffuse lymphomatous spread in the brain parenchyma was observed. By applying a highly sensitive in situ hybridization technique (ISH) using digoxigenin-labeled anti-sense riboprobes, abundant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small nuclear RNAs (EBER) transcripts could be demonstrated in each case studied. A combination of ISH with immunohistochemical staining for latent membrane protein (LMP-1) and EBV nuclear antigen-2 (EBNA-2) showed different patterns of EBV latency with a predominance of the broad spectrum (EBER+/EBNA-2+/LMP-1+). Clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes were demonstrated in four cases using a sensitive polymerase chain reaction. In one patient the rearrangement pattern suggested biclonal lymphoproliferation. Our observations confirm the implication of the EBV in the etiology of AIDS-related primary malignant lymphomas of the brain. The demonstration of EBV gene products and clonal IgH rearrangements even in small biopsy samples is a useful tool for distinguishing between reactive and neoplastic lymphocytic infiltrates, which are frequently observed in brain and cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained from AIDS patients.
