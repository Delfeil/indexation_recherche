Patients and methods. We have studied mid-latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) during general anaesthesia with sufentanil in ten patients scheduled for elective major urological surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with sufentanil 2-3 µg/kg; for maintenance of anaesthesia a further bolus of sufentanil (1-2 µg/kg) 10 min before the start of surgery (skin incision) was given. MLAEP were recorded before and 10 min after the last sufentanil bolus on the vertex (positive) and mastoids on both sides (negative). Latencies of the peaks V, Na, Pa, Nb, and P1 (ms) and amplitudes Na/Pa, Pa/Nb, and Nb/P1 (µV) were measured.
