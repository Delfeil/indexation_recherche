In haemodynamically unstable patients with an unstable pelvic ring injury the primary stabilisation of the pelvis and thus reduction of pelvic volume is important for the success of the treatment. The pelvic C-clamp is an approved emergency device for these unstable pelvic ring injuries. A secondary procedure though is necessary in most of the cases with a hig rate of wound problems in already traumatized soft tissue areas. The ventrally placed external fixator is a simple and quick procedure with little soft tissue damage. Though primary stability is sufficient even for C-type injuries, biomechanic stability of the posterior pelvic ring is often isufficient for mobilization. Based on biomechanic considerations, a new dorsal oblique pelvic external fixator was developed for pelvic C-type injuries. With the advantages of the supraacetabular fixator and two additional Schanz screws the ventral fixator should stabilize the posterior pelvic ring with comparable stability to the pelvic C-clamp. A primary and already definitive minimal invasive stabilization of the posterior pelvic ring was the aim. In the first series several variations of this asymmetric fixator with two different Schanz screw applications were tested biomechanically. In a second series the favorite version was tested versus the supraacetabular fixator and the pelvic C-clamp. Both of the biomechanic test series were performed with artificial pelves in the one leg stance model in the material testing machine. SI disruption and sacral fracture were the posterior instability types in 6 pelves each. There was no statistically significant difference between the dorsal oblique fixator and the pelvic C-clamp. But the new fixator was significantly more stable than the supraacetabular fixator or the new fixator without pretension.
