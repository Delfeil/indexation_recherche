 Diagnosis of bacterial infection and/or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine. White blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) due to noninfectious causes. There is a number of non-infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and CRP elevation. In the last 3 years, Procalcitonin (PCT) was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection, especially sepsis. PCT appears to have several advantages; it is of non-hepatic (yet unknown) origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency. There is no PCT-increase in acute graft-rejection, viral disease, and autoimmune disorders. Some studys showed a prognostic value of PCT in sepsis due to peritonitis and pancreatitis. PCT appears to be a new and helpful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients. Further studies are needed to finally established PCT in the daily management of critically ill patients. At this time significantly higher costs are the major detraction to daily or frequent measurements.
