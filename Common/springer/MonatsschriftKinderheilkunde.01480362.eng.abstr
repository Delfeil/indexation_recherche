This case report is on a 15-month old child who became intoxicated by methadone prescribed to his father, a drug addict. He at that time was treated with methadone as a substitute for heroin. This fact was not known to the doctors on duty. In spite of the classical signs of opiate intoxication miosis, coma, and respiratory insufficiency, the presumed diagnosis was rejected because the father denied taking any drugs when being asked. It was not before the father admitted to be a drug addict that the child's history became clear: The sweet and reddish methadone solution had been put into a baby's bottle by the members in his doctor's office. Back home the child took it as "his" bottle and swallowed some recalculated 30 mg of methadone. As soon as laboratory examination showed 1.2 mg/l methadone in the urine and 0.1 mg/l in the serum, repeated antidote treatment with 0.01 mg naloxone per kg body weight was started. After 2 days the child was able to breath sufficiently without taking the antidote and was discharged healthy 1 day later.
