Modern network technologies provide the basic infrastructure for information and communication systems in the hospital today. The goal to build up a universal network infrastructure which meets the broadly varied requirements. Analysis of data communication in the hospital and the evaluation of established network technologies, as well as new developments, leads to the switching concept as the suitable solution. Two technologies play the major role in building enterprise networks: the Ethernet family, based on frame switching, and ATM, based on cell switching. Orientation on established standards is the key to free system choice and grants interoperability between systems from different manufacturers. However, the network design must meet the application and system architecture of the information technology in order to achieve successful mapping of the involved communication profiles. This means scaling of the bandwidth as needed, suitable segmenting of the network and resilient links. In a further step, policy-based networking takes advantages of prioritizing critical applications and therefore reduces interdependencies across the network.
