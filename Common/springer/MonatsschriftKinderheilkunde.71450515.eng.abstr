The diagnosis Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) in the neonate is difficult because features like neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems are easily misdiagnosed as a consequence of peripartal asphyxia. Craniofacial abnormalities like narrow bifrontal diameter, almond shaped palpebral fissures and openend downturned mouth are underdiagnosed especially if respiratory treatment is necessary. Hypogonadism in girls and in milder expression in boys (for example cryptorchism) are common and unspecific signs at that age. Typical features like obesity and hyperphagia, small hands and feet and small stature are not expressed until the second year. The clinical course of PWS in the neonate is demonstrated in two cases. Diagnostic criteria and therapeutic intervention are discussed. Hydrops fetalis as a seldom feature in PWS has to be taken into consideration.
