Purpose: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to provide immediate occlusion of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), followed by recurrent leakage after single PDT in the majority of the cases after 3 months. Indocyanine green angiography (ICG-A) was used to evaluate completeness of CNV occlusion, effects on physiological choroid and patterns of CNV recurrence.
