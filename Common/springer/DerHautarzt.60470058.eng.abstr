A HIV-infected patient in stage CDC 3A with porphyria cutanea tarda (type I) was treated with chloroquin for some months and this led to full remission. The patient course is compared with earlier reports on HIV-infected patients with porphyria cutanea tarda. Possible provocation factors for porphyria cutanea tarda in HIV infection are considered. The increased prevalence of porphyria cutanea tarda in HIV infection, the interaction of HIV and UV irradiation as a prediposing factor for porphyria cutanea tarda and the photosensitivity present in HIV infection are discussed.
