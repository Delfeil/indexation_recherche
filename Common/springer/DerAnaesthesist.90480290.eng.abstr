A paper published in various US journals on Emergency Medicine in 1997 [9], has raised considerable concerns. The authors [9] question if it is justified to continue to recommend initial ventilation as part of basic CPR when performed by lay-bystanders. A few aspects need to be discussed and some  questions have to be answered before any changes in the current recommendations may even be considered: e.g. 1. How convincing does the available evidence support the following hypotheses: 1.1. Lay CPR without mouth-to-mouth-ventilation provides better outcome after cardiac arrest than lay CPR with mouth-to-mouth-ventilation. 1.2. Endotracheal intubation may be detrimental in patients suffering from hemodynamic compromises, particularly from VF [46]. 2. Is it scientifically and ethically acceptable to design and perform prospective randomized controlled trials(RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of those components of BCLS and ACLS which have in accordance with AHA-, ERC Guidlines and ILCOR Statements in the past been applied in millions of cardiac arrest victims and have obviously enabled the patients to lead a meaningsful life after survival; under conditions of the proposed study design patients of the study group would be left without the treatment option ventilation, thus diminishing their chances of survival.
