 Within a 10-year period, 50 patients with postoperative ulcer recurrence after gastric resection were treated; 31 of these had one, 8 two, 5 three and 6 four previous gastric operations. Ulcer recurrence was attributed to surgery-related causes in 78 % of the cases: excessively large gastric remnant 56 %, anastomotic stenosis 18 %, loop problems 4 %. Some 22 % of the patients had causes independent of previous surgery: abuse of non-steroidal antirheumatics (NSAR) 10 %, hyperacidity of normal gastric remnant 6 %, Zollinger-Ellison-Syndrom 6 %. The most important co-factor of ulcer genesis was chronic abuse of NSAR (38 % of the total series). The interval between onset of complaints of ulcer disease and the last ulcer-dependent operation amounted on average to 13.8 (0.5-36) years. The definitive treatment of recurrent ulceration was surgery in 34 cases - indicated by ulcer complications (73.5 %) or failure of medical therapy (26.5 %) - and conservative treatment in 16 cases. Surgery comprised 21 re-resections, 7 thoracic truncal vagotomies, 4 total gastrectomies, 1 Whipple procedure and 1 enucleation of gastrinoma (hospital mortality 0 %). During the follow-up period (median 7.1 years, follow-up rate 96 %), the cumulative ulcer re-recurrence rate was 57 % for the conservatively treated group and 17.6 % for the patients treated by surgery (p < 0.05). In none of the eight patients who died during long-term follow-up was the cause of death ulcer-related.
