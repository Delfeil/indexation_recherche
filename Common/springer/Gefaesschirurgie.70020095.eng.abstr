 Revascularization in cases of recurrent occlusions following aorto-iliac vascular reconstructions, particular in high-risk patients, poses a therapeutic dilemma. We report the case of a 78-year-old female patient who presented - after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries - with Leriche syndrome, resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease. Due to the high surgical and anesthetic risk we implanted an axillo-bifemoral PTFE graft. The preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high-grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid-subclavian bypass on the left. This stenosis was dilated and then stented by way of the proximal end of the axillo-bifemoral graft, which in turn was distally anastomosed to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery. Postoperative angiography verified a good run-off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained. Duplex sonography 6 months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms. These results demonstrate that, combined with intraoperative stent application, an axillo-bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results.
