A study is presented where after educative counselling HIV-negative partners of HIV-positive people are provided with an emergency pack of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) medication. This enables them to start a post exposure prophylaxis immediately in a case of HIV exposure and helps to avoid delays until a physician with experience in HIV care can be consulted. The study is aimed to investigate how often HIV exposures occur in serodiscordant couples, whether the availability of PEP increases risk behaviour, whether the individual participants are able to distinguish PEP-justifying exposures from those with a lower risk of transmission, and whether an emergency pack is adequate to enable timely initiation of PEP.  13 participants were recruited so far. Of these, 5 couples were aware of the HIV-serodiscordance at the time the relationship started, while the other 8 found out about the HIV infection of one partner while the relationship was already going on for some time. The first group had a median number of 35 sexual contacts within the last three months prior to the start of the study, whereas the second group had a median number of 3,5 sexual contacts. In the course of the observation which included a cumulative time of 56 patient months, three HIV exposures occured. In two cases PEP was initiated within less than an hour, in one case no medication was taken.  Whether the number of risk contacts increases in these couples as a consequence of the availability of PEP medication remains to be seen.The current data support the assumption that an emergency pack is a reasonable and feasible intervention for HIV-serodiscordant couples.
