 Purpose The treatment of aortic aneurysms with endovascular stent graft prostheses is receiving increasing attention. Concerns still remain regarding the long-term results of endovascular aortic endografting. The most troublesome problems have been blood leakages around the graft system with continued risk of aneurysm rupture. The shrinkage of the aneurysm sack as a good sign of excluded aneurysm is discussed controversially. The aim of our study was to evaluate contrast-enhanced color duplex ultrasound scans (CECDU) in detecting endoleaks.
