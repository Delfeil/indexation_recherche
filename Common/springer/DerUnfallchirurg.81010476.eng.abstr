The results of early conversion of war fractures by the application of AO osteosynthesis in A group (n = 32) of the injuried, were compared with B group (n = 187) of injuried, treated definitely with external fixator. There were statistical evaluations and X-ray observations of healing in both groups, as well as the appearances of the most frequent complications such as: Pintract infection, osteitis, pseudoarthrosis and reoperation. Statistically less significant appearance of complications in A group during 2th and 6th month (p < 0.001) was observed. In 12th month of observation, these differences statistically disappeared. Healing observed by X-ray in 2th, 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups.
