 Hospital mortality from acute myocardial infarction has decreased in the last two decades. Left ventricular dysfunction therefore have been mainly due to ischemia. After extensive myocardial infarction, there are processes of adaptation (remodeling) which result in altered geometry of the left ventricle. The effects of this on neurohormonal systems (organ regulation), on the changed ratio of myocyte mass and collagen content owing to reactive and reparative fibrosis (organ texture) and on the molecular and cellular mechanisms (organ structure) are of crucial importance. Depending on the structural changes, the myocardial contractility decreases. This associated with an activation of the circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).
