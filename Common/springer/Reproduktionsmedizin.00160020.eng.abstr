Transvaginal ultrasound and Doppler sonography can be used to assess the chance of implantation in cycles undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation. To this end, endometrial tickness, uterine, subendometrial and ovarian blood flow are measured. Three-dimensional ultrasound, which has recently been introduced into clinical practice, allows precise and reproducible volume calculation of the reproductive organs. For the first time quantification of vessel density and blood flow within any given area is made possible by 3D power Doppler sonography. Nevertheless, for most of above parameters, the results in the literature are controversial. The newer techniques of follicular blood-flow analysis and quantitative measurement of subendometrial perfusion and vascularization, however, have shown promising results in early studies.
