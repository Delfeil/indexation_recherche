 This case report shows the symptoms, aetiology and surgical treatment of a rare disease, Werner's syndrome (progeria adultorum). This patient suffered from diffuse calcification of the vascular system with critical limb ischaemia and occlusions of the popliteal artery and the postpopliteal trifurcation. The arterial reconstruction consisted of a femorotibial venous bypass. Only in the proximal third of the anterior tibial artery was it possible to demonstrate a short vessel segment with less calcification. The anterior tibial artery was the only vessel suitable for reanastomosis. The postoperative course was uneventful and the graft patency was verified by computed tomographic angiography without the use of contrast medium. With this type of imaging, flow and configuration of the bypass and of the anastomoses could be demonstrated. In general, the prognosis of Werner's syndrome is fatal as a result of general arteriosclerosis; collateralization and regeneration of the arterial vessel system is insufficient.
