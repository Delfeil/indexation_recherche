Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a naturally occurring transmitter in the mammalian brain, related to sleep regulation and possibly to energy balance in diving or hibernating animals. It has been used for almost 35 years as an intravenous agent for induction of anaesthesia and for long-term sedation. Its convincing pharmacological properties, without serious adresse effects on circulation or respiration, are compromised by its unpredictable duration of action. This is not a major problem with long-term sedation during ICU treatment. GHB has been used with good results for sedation of patients with severe brain injury, where it compares favourably with barbiturates. In animal studies, it seems to possess a protective action against hypoxia on a cellular and whole organ level. However, in some experimental animals GHB has been shown to produce seizure-like activities, and the compound is being used to produce absence-like seizures. GHB has been used in our ICU for years to provide adequate sedation for patients under controlled ventilation or for patients figthing the respirator during spontaneous respiration. No serious side effects were observed in these patients, while in some patients under haemodialysis hypernatraemia and metabolic alkalosis developed; both were reversible after discontinuation of GHB and restriction of additional sodium input (Somsanit, the commercially available GHB preparation in Germany, contains 9.2 mmol sodium/g; the daily dose averages 20-40 g GHB, i.e. 180-370 mmol sodium).
