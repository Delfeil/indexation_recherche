In a prospective, randomised, double-masked, parallel-group study we compared the antiinflammatory effect of diclofenac sodium 0.1%, flurbiprofen 0.03%, and indomethacin 1.0% ophthalmic suspension in 99 patients undergoing phacoemulsification and posterior chamber lens implantation. The reduction in anterior chamber flare from day 1, as measured with the laser flare-meter (FM-500, KOWA) on day 4 - 5 postoperatively was significantly greater in the diclofenac group than with flurbiprofen (p = 0.022). Patients treated with diclofenac had significantly less burning and stinging than patients on flurbiprofen and indomethacin on postoperative days 4 - 5 (p<0.0001) and 12 - 14 (p = 0.001). Diclofenac sodium appears to be more potent than flurbiprofen in controlling intraocular inflammation after cataract surgery, while having better local tolerance than flurbiprofen or indomethacin.
