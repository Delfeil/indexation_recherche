The German Social Law has required quality assurance (QA) procedures since 1989. The measures must be suitable to allow "comparing investigations". In 1992 the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine published recommendations for QA in anaesthesia: most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner, and thus, a list of 63 pitfalls, events, and complications (PECs) and five degrees of severity were defined. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of PECs in anaesthesia and to correlate PECs with procedures and preoperative health status.
