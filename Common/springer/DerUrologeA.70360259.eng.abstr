Epidermoid cysts are rare, benign tumors of the testis or, less frequently, the inguinal cord. Generally, they affect males between 10 and 39 years. In newborns they are rare. We report on a newborn with an epidermoid cyst of the right testis that had been diagnosed in utero and was removed with preservation of the testicle.
