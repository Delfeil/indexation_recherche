Men suffering from varicocele have lower mean sperm counts and "worse" seminal parameters than those without a varicocele. Also in those with a varicocele, who already fathered a child, the mean sperm count is lower than in other fertile men. The observations, however, do not refer specifically to an existing varicocele, but are common also in other spermatogenic defects. This holds also true for the frequency of tapering forms.
