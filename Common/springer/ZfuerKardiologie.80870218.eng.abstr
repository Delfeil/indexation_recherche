  Imaging of cardiac masses is technically highly demanding. Imaging techniques should fulfill the following requirements: excellent spatial and temporal resolution, short imaging time, broad availability, low cost. Diagnostic questions include: tumor origin, size, extension, tissue type, functional consequences of tumor involvement. Transthoracic echocardiography is the imaging technique of choice in most patients. If clinical questions remain, TEE, CT or MRI can be used as secondary imaging techniques. Advantages of MRI include: excellent spatial and temporal resolution, multiplanar capabilities, large field of view, lack of radiation. Pericardial and intracardiac as well as paracardiac masses are depicted in great detail and therapeutically relevant information is usually obtained in addition to what is known from echocardiography. Although tissue differentiation is possible, a histologic diagnosis cannot be obtained. Disadvantages of MRI are artifacts in patients with severe arrhythmias or dyspnoea.
