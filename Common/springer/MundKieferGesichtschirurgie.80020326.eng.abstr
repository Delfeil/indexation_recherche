Objective: The Uppsala-definition of leukoplakia has recently redefined oral leukoplakia. Based on this definition, the aim of our study was to reevaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with histologically proven primary oral cancer. Design: A total of 101 inpatients in four tumor centers in Berlin were interviewed and clinically examined just prior to surgery of an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Results: The prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15.8%. Additional leukoplakias without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4% of the patients. There were no significant differences in age- or sex-distribution, history of tobacco habits or diet  between patients with or without leukoplakia. T1 carcinomas were found in 62.5% of patients with, and 24.4% of patients without associated leukoplakia, whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre-operative staging of the tumor. Conclusions: The prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with OSCC was low, compared to retrospective studies. The presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor, except of tumor size. The results emphasize that most OSCC develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa.
