A one year old girl suffered a traumatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery after a fall with a pencil in her mouth. The resulting stroke with massive cytotoxic edema and an intermittent SIADH caused a life threatening cerebral coma 18 hours later. Due to therapy of the cerebral edema and anticoagulation with intravenous heparin the neurologic condition stabilized after one week. Within one year the child regained the ability to walk. A left sided hemiparesis persisted despite intensive physical- and occupational therapy.
