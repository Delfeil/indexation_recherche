The use of autogenous transplants and the application of intraoperatively customised alloplastic materials show, in cases of secondary orbital reconstruction, a higher postoperative morbidity caused by additional approaches to the transplant donor site. On the other hand, thorough surgical exploration and fitting of the transplants or alloplastic materials greatly prolongs operating times. For these reasons we designed ceramic implants (Bioverit) on the basis of stereolithography models and prefabricated them using a commercially available dental copy milling unit (Celay). In five cases up until now seven customised implants have been inserted for reconstruction of the lamina papyracea, zygomatic complex and infraorbital floor and rim. Encouraged by the good postoperative aesthetic and functional results, with significantly reduced operating times and morbidity in all cases, we will continue to take this technique into account for reconstruction after complex orbital fractures.
