The syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumour disease of the neuroendocrine system with manifestations in the parathyroids, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland and rarely also in the stomach and thymus. Recently, the MEN 1 gene locus has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 11. This gene most likely belongs to the tumour suppressor genes, the allelic loss of which causes tumour development. The pancreatic and duodenal tumours may metastasize, but usually have a low malignant potential. Clinically, most MEN 1 patients present between the age of 20 and 35 with hyperparathyroidism and/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
