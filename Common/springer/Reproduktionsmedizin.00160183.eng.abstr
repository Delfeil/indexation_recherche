Human seminal plasma anaphylaxis has to be differentiated from allergic reactions to latex, spermicidal substances, local anesthetics or components of lubricants. In this review article, IgE-mediated (type I) allergic reactions against seminal plasma antigens are discussed. Corresponding symptoms have rarely been reported. However, it is likely that a significant number of cases remain unpublished or undiagnosed. Most patients are younger than 40 years. Human seminal plasma anaphylaxis is not always associated with female infertility. Symptoms start immediately or within 1 h after exposure to the ejaculate. Local reactions include itching, burning, erythema and edema of the perivaginal region or other areas that have been exposed to seminal plasma. Systemic reactions are dyspnea, dysphagia, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal symptoms, anaphylaxic shock or exacerbation of atopic eczema. These complaints may become manifest during the first sexual intercourse. Available data imply that seminal plasma allergens are of prostatic origin and that prostate specific antigen is one of the clinically relevant components. The diagnostic procedure is based on medical history, evaluation of specific IgE antibodies in the serum of patients and skin tests. Patients are advised to avoid allergen contact by proper use of condoms. In occasional cases specific hyposensitization has been performed successfully.
