  New ideas in the support of the elderly such as self determination of residents on the one hand, normalization, individualization and opening of geriatric care centers on the other, led to an increasing importance of social work in homes for the elderly. Full quality-management and basic data are instruments for forming a professional profile. On the other hand there is a lack of empirical studies on this topic. This paper presents the results of an activity analysis of 16 persons employed in the social services in homes for the elderly of one non profit organisation in Baden-Württemberg. The main work in direct help for the residents consists in the realization and organisation of social activities and in offers of groupwork. This involves measures to structure the day and to promote social contacts. Besides social legal advice, the psycho-social advice for residents and their relatives in order to help them to master critical events and master changes in behaviour caused by gerontopsychiatric illness is of special importance. In an indirect way social work concentrates on the internal organisation of coordinating managed care and social support in a multiprofessional team and other service sectors of the institution. The opening of homes and their integration within the community is achieved by information and public relations work, for example by the cooperation with local clubs, external services and help, and last but not least, by recruting and advising volunteers.
