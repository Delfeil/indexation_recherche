Sudden hearing loss and tinnitus were the clinical findings of a 36-year-old soccer player after playing ball with his head. ENT therapy confirmed the diagnosis by an audiogram and a conventional intravenous application was performed. A reduction of the tinnitus was observed but the hearing loss persisted. 6 days after the initial hearing loss a single manual therapy was able to restore the normal hearing function. Audiograms before and after manual therapy are presented.
