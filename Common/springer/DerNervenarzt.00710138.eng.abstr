In 1998 Minor et al. described a new variant of perilymphatic fistula: the "superior canal dehiscence syndrome". This syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure. It is caused by a dehiscence of bone overlying the superior (anterior) semicircular canal. Due to this dehiscence, a third, mobile window (in addition to the round and oval windows) is formed, and changes in pressure are pathologically transduced to the anterior semicircular canal.
