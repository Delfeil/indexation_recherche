The exteroceptive suppression period (ES) of the temporalis muscle activity is a trigemino-trigeminal brain stem reflex. It will be elicited most when stimulating trigeminal sensory afferents by painful stimuli and typically leads to a biphasic interruption of voluntary muscle activity. The first phase of decreased voluntary activity is called the early exteroceptive suppression period (ES1), the second, the late exteroceptive suppression period (ES2). Between these two suppression periods a phase of increased muscle activity, the so-called facilitation period (FP), can be seen. This phenomenon can be modulated by different stimulating parameters and usually, in healthy subjects, this normal pattern of the exteroceptive suppression can be elicited regularly. The reflex answer may occur at low non-painful stimulus intensities; typically, however, it appears to be most pronounced with highintensity stimuli. Because of the obvious relationship between stimulus intensity, pain perception and reflex, the reflex is regarded as an antinociceptive reaction. The absence of an inhibition of motor activity can be visualized, for example, in hemimasticatory spasm or dystonic disorders. However, above all the ES nowadays attracts most attention as a tool to analyse different pain syndromes. One main advantage of this method in man is the ability to evaluate certain antinociceptive brain stem mechanisms functionally by means of a simple noninvasive technique. A large number of results have been obtained showing that chronic pain syndromes such as chronic tension-type headache and migraine cause changes within the normal ES recording pattern. Furthermore, some substances used in pain therapy, such as serotonin agonists or antagonists, acetylsalicylic acid or naloxone, may also alter the general appearance of the ES. This review will summarize different parameters that influence the ES reflex answer. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of changes in the ES for pathophysiological processes regarding pain perception and processing in certain painsyndromes will be discussed.
