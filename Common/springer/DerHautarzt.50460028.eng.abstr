Abstract.  Primary cutaneous large cell anaplastic non-Hodgkin lymphomas positive for Ki-1-antigen are rarely described. There are 100 published cases worldwide. Typically large cell anaplastic lymphomas have an inflammatory appearance, which often leads to false diagnosis and unsuccessful treatment with antibiotics. Histological examination reveals a highly malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The tumour is composed of large pleomorphic lymphoid cells composed of T-cells in 80% of the cases and of B-cells in 10%. The immunological phenotype in the remaining 10% remains unclear. Crucial for the diagnosis is the expression of CD30 antigen in >70% of the tumour cells. This article presents 5 cases of cutaneous Ki-1-positive lymphoma seen in our Berlin department during the last 10 years. In 4 patients the diagnosis was established in clinical stage I of cutaneous lymphoma without further manifestation; 1 patient had lymph node involvement and was in stage II. Total excision of the primary tumour in stage I with adjuvant polychemotherapy in stages II - IV led to complete remission in all cases. Long-term remissions were seen in case 1 (2 years) and in case 5 (1 year), whilst 2 patients showed local relapse, and 1 patient showed generalized lymphogenic and haematogenic metastasis. After repeated surgical removal or irradiation of the tumour and adjuvant polychemotherapy, further complete remission was achieved in 2 patients (up to now lasting 1 and 4 years). Another patient has been in partial remission for the last 2 years. Our observations underline the high relapse rate of large cell anaplastic lymphoma. There was no difference in the incidence of relapse whether the primary tumour was surgically excised or treated with total excision plus adjuvant polychemotherapy. In anaplastic tumours of the skin the diagnosis of Ki-1-lymphoma should be considered.
