Objective: To study the concentrations of TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 in the human lower uterine segment at 4 stages of cervical dilatation during term and preterm parturition. Methods: Specimens were obtained from 35 women in term and of 33 women in preterm parturition undergoing non-elective cesarean section at various stages of cervical dilatation (less than 2 cm, 2 - 3 cm, 4 - 6 cm, and more than 6 cm). The concentrations of TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 in protein extracts prepared from the tissue samples were measured by enzyme immunoassays. Results: At term the median concentration (cervical dilatation less than 2 cm) of TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 ws 7.9 pg/ml total protein (TP), 1.3 pg/ml TP, 12.6 pg/mg TP and 17.2 pg/mg TP, respectively. The concentrations of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 increased significantly in the 4 - 6 cm dilated cervix. No further increase was detectable at more than 6 cm dilatation. In preterm parturition the median concentration (cervical dilatation less than 2 cm) of TNF, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 was 16.5 pg/mg TP, 1.1 pg/mg TP, 10.3 pg/ml TP, and 13.6 pg/mg TP, respectively. The concentrations of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 were significantly higher at 2 - 3 cm dilatation. Conclusion: During parturition at term, concentrations of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in the lower uterine seg-ment increase. Similar changes seem to occur during preterm parturition.
