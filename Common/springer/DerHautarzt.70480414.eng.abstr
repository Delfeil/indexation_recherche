Solitary or bilateral, symptomless exostoses on the lingual surface of the mandibule are called mandibular torus. It is mainly seen in young males and has a benign clinical course. The etiopathology is not known. Both genetic and environmental factors such as the anatomy of the lower jaw are considered. Syndromes associated with facial exostoses such as Proteus syndrome or Gardner's syndrome should be clinically excluded. A 40-year-old man with exostoses of the jaw is reported. With this case report we would like to draw attention to a disease which has rarely been described in the German dermatological literature.
