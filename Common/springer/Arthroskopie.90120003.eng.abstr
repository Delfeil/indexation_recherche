The biochemical properties of articular cartilage rely on the biochemical composition and integrity of its extracellular matrix. This matrix consists mainly of a collagen network and the proteoglycan-rich ground substance. In osteoarthritis, ongoing cartilage matrix destruction takes place, which leads to a progressive loss in joint function. Besides the degradation of molecular matrix components also the destabilization of supramolecular structures such as the collagen network takes place. These processes as well as the cellular reaction pattern explain the histomorphology of osteoarthritic cartilage degeneration: the loss of histochemical proteogylcan staining reflects the damage on the molecular level, whereas the supramolecular matrix destruction leads to fissuring and finally to the loss of the cartilage. The chondrocytes react by increasing matrix synthesis, and also by proliferation and changing their cellular phenotype. For the management of osteoarthrits, early and prognostically relevant diagnostic criteria are desired, but new analytical tools are needed in order to supplement conventional histopathological evaluation.
