Considering demand, utilisation and effectiviness of psychosomatic consultation-/liaison services, the present study investigated for the first time more accurately the effectiveness of a psychosomatic-dermatologic consultation service. The extent of compliance with recommendations was correlated with clinical and demographic characteristics as well as with potentially influencing aspects like frequency of contacts, attitude towards the consultation and satisfaction with it. For this purpose, two years after the consultation the medical records were analysed and a catamnestic questionnaire was sent out. In the sample of N  = 69 patients with a recommendation for further activities we found a compliance rate of 78,3%, in the subgroup of those with a recommendation for psychotherapy it was 69%. There was no significant correlation neither with clinical or demographic characteristics nor with frequency of contacts. However, 70,5% of the patients had only one contact. A positive attitude towards the consultation and experiencing the contact atmosphere as pleasant had enhancing effects on compliance. In conclusion, a high effectiveness could be achieved with a relatively small effort of time and manpower.
