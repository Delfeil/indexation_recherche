For patients with carcinoma of the breast the detection of distant metastases means that definitive recovery is no longer possible, since any further treatment can only be palliative in nature. Consequently, the holistic approach of palliative medicine centres on the patients' quality of life, which is determined not only by their physical condition but also by their level of psychosocial wellbeing. In view of the pain experienced by 75 % of patients with metastatic mammary carcinoma and the effect of pain on their general wellbeing, adequate pain therapy, which can almost always be given by the oral route, so that outpatient treatment is possible, is the first priority. In addition, therapeutic control of other symptoms associated with the tumor or with the treatment is of fundamental importance. Care of these patients makes particular personal demands on the doctors, care staff, etc., to enable them to provide psychological and human support for those incurable patients in the final stage of their life.
