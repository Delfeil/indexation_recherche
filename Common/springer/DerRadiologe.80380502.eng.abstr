Malignant cartilaginous tumors (chondrosarcomas) are, with a relative frequency of 20%, the second most common malignant tumors of bone after osteosarcoma. The diagnosis of chondrosarcoma can usually be made confidently based on combination of clinical information, radiographs, Gd-enhanced MR imaging, and histologic examination of a biopsy sample. The combination of these parameters is important because accuracy of histologic diagnosis is adversely affected by unrepresentative sampling of these usually large tumors. The prognosis of patients with chondrosarcoma becomes poorer with more axial location, higher histologic grade, larger tumor size and inadeqaute resection. By careful analysis of radiographs and Gd-enhanced MR imaging the radiologist has the ability to improve the management of patients with chondrosarcoma.
