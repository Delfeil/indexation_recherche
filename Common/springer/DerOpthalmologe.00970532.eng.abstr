Background. The pathobiology in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is complex. The mechanism of the release of retinal cells from their cellular bond is unknown. The metalloproteinase stromelysin cleaves proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This may liberate retinal cells. The expression of stromelysin in human RPE cells has been demonstrated. Here, stromelysin gene expression under all-trans-Retinal (atR) was investigated.
