 A case of delayed death after a low-voltage accident is presented. At first, an obvious source of electricity was not found. However, electric marks were found on the fingers. The identification of the conductor was performed by analysis of the metallisation of the electric marks. The location of the probable conductors in a boiler under the hand basin and the discovery in a standing position prior to collapse in a bathtub indicates that the capability to act was preserved for a short time period. In such rare cases death seems to be a result of cardiac arrhythmia resulting in ventricular fibrillation.
