 The arterial blood supply of the arm is unique, as the collateral circulation is especially good. Because of this anatomic peculiarity it is possible to deal with lack of peripheral pulse without critical ischemia occurring in fractures in the elbow region. We present two children with supracondylar fractures of the humerus with damage to the brachial artery and the different management results. It is necessary to carry out the immediate diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in order to prevent late complications. We conclude that Volkmann's ischemic contracture can always be prevented.
