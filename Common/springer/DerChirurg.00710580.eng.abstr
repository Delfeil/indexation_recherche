Abstract.  The potential for improvement of the results of laparoscopic operations as well as necessity of enhanced efficiency in the health-care systems are the main reasons for development and practical use of robotic systems in the field of laparoscopic surgery. While robotic systems imitate the human camera-holder the Image Tracking System (ImagTrac, Olympus,Tokio) is based on another principle: A voice-activated zoom function allows change between overview and detailed view. In the zoom-in position it is possible to select four different fields of view. The results of a clinical trial with control group show that the system: 1. Makes it possible to dispense with the human camera-holder without compromising patient safety, sometimes at greater convenience to the surgeon. 2. Makes it possible for routine laparoscopic operations such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy and laparoscopic hernia repair to be performed (as solo surgery) by a team of a surgeon and a nurse only. 3. Is more cost-effective than robotic systems with a similar range of features.
