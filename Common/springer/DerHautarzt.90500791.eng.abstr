The present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease-specific stress of eighty-six patients with psoriasis and fifty-eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the PsoriSol Clinic, Hersbruck, Germany. In addition to receiving instruction about their stain disease, the patients were offered, practice in relaxation techniques, social contacts and scratching control as well as individual psychological counselling. The clinical change was assessed by PASI and SCORAD, respectively. The Marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases (MHF) and a questionnaire for health-related control attributes (GKÜ-S) served as psychometric measures. Patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre-post comparison. Social fears, avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups. Patients with psoriasis also showed an increase in internal control attributes. Dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
