Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and lactation has great preventive importance for the health of the young child. Important determinants are the pregravid nutritional status of the mother, the quantity and quality of the nutrition and gestational weight gain. Diseases of the mother that have to be treated by a special diet like diabetes mellitus or maternal PKU can complicate the maternal situation. Optimal nutrition during pregnancy includes at least in the 2nd or 3rd trimester increased energy supply (+300 kcal/day) and an increase in all nutrients, including minerals and vitamins. Of special importance are -3-fatty acids, iron, magnesium, zinc, iodine, and folic acid, vita-min B12 and vitamin K. Under- and overnu-trition and deficiencies in the above nutrients may have an influence on the outcome of pregnancy and the health of the baby: more spontaneous abortions, prematurity, low birth weight, birth defects, intra- and extrauterine developmental disturbances and organ dysfunctions.
