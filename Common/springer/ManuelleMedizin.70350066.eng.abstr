In a retrospective study on 71 injured patients, the symptomatic and recorded data were evaluated to evaluate the value of diagnostic procedures in patients with whiplash injury. Then followed orthopedic, radiologic, neurologic, ophthalmologic, psychiatric and MRT examinations. In the anamnestic data, extracervical symptoms like vertigo, blurred vision and weakness in the shoulders are symptoms that usually mean a prolonged recovery (more than 4 weeks). In the diagnostic procedures, orthopedic and X-ray standard technics are only valuable as screening or elimination techniques for severe injuries. A functional X-ray diagnosis gives a non-exact overview about segmental function. None of these procedures verified the subjective symptoms. Neurologic and psychiatric examinations demonstrated normal findings even in patients with acute symptoms and were thus not helpful in finding responsible disturbances. Ophthalmological examinations are indicated in patients with visual disturbances in the early posttraumatic phase. In Purtscher disease acute visual disturbances can be explained as caused by trauma. MRT tested successfully for screening or for exact documentation of post-traumatic lesions in bone, discoligament, vascular and neurological structures.
