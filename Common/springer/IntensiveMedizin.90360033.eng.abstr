 The onset of sepsis often represents a life-threatening complication in an intensive care setting. Early diagnosis is crucial to the further course of the disorder and the prognosis for the patient. Scoring systems for early diagnosis of postoperative and wound sepsis have already been developed for groups of surgical patients. However, these systems cannot by applied without restriction to groups of nonsurgical patients. The purpose of this study was to develop an easily implemented scoring system for confirming the diagnosis and monitoring the course of sepsis in a group of nonsurgical intensive care patients without having to resort to invasive catheterization to measure cardiac output. A sepsis score was developed with seven individual parameters: respiration rate, heart rate, body temperature, C-reactive protein, lactate, leukocytes, and thrombocytes. The highest point value of each individual parameter is 3; the score for a maximum septic circulatory situation is 21.
