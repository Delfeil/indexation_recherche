We present a case report of a 15 year old girl suffering from a hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with the symptoms of oligodontia and teeth anomalies. Her hair growth pattern was generally reduced and the Minor-sweat-test showed pathological results. On histological examination there were no sweatglands and only rudimentary adnexal structures. In the mother and sister of the patient only a hypodontia could be diagnosed.
