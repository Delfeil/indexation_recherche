 A 25-year-old woman with Kartagener's syndrome was admitted to hospital for laparoscopy because of sterility. Kartagener's syndrome is a rare disorder involving the combination of situs inversus, bronchiectasis and sinusitis. A dynein deficiency leads to ciliary dyskinesia. When general anaesthesia is to be induced in a patient with Kartagener's syndrome the following points must be borne in mind: ascertainment of the preoperative pulmonary status, antibiotic coverage, recognition of dextrocardia, necessity for aseptic techniques because of the possibility of abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis. Anticholinergic and antitussive medications are relatively contraindicated, as are nasal tubes. In the present case an intubation anaesthesia with thiopental, nitrous oxide, enflurane and succinylcholine was carried out; cefoxitin was administered for antibiotic treatment, and the patient made an uneventful recovery.
