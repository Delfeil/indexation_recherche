  A case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented. The diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid. This is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy. Myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of intraparietal masses visualized at echocardiography.
