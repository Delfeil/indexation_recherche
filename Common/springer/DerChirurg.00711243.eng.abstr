Abstract.  Background: Slippage (SP) of the stomach is the most common postoperative complication after laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB) for morbid obesity. Methods and patients: A randomized prospective study was constructed in order to determine whether laparoscopic placement behind the cardia (RKP) is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative SP and pouch dilation than after a retrogastric placement (RGP) of the LAP band using a common technique. Morbidly obese patients presenting for LASGB were randomized to undergo either an RKP (n = 50) or an RGP (n = 51). Results: There were three postoperative SP and three pouch dilations in the RGP group versus no postoperative complication in the RKP group. Conclusions: The placement of LAP band by the RKP technique is safe and followed by a lower frequency of postoperative complications than with the RGP technique. Clear anatomical landmarks are a benefit to the education and learning curve of LASGB.
