Between November 1993 and September 1995, we carried out visual laser ablation of the prostate (VLAP) in 72 high-risk patients (ASA 3-4; severe cardiovascular and/or pulmonary diseases) aged 60-88 years (mean 76.7 years); the prostate volume was 22-136 ml (mean 56 ml). The urinary peak flow rates (Qmax.) ranged from 2 to 15 ml/s (mean 4.4 ml/s) preoperatively; 42 patients (58.3 %) suffered from acute urinary retention for up to 2 weeks and had an indwelling catheter. The residual urinary volume (RUV) was 0-320 ml (mean 142.3 ml) in those 30 patients with spontaneous micturition. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) ranged from 10 to 33 (mean 21.8). In the first 37 patients, pressure-flow studies were carried out only in cases of doubt to verify obstruction. In the last 35 patients, pressure-flow studies were carried out in every case. Perioperatively, there was no appearance of blood loss of absorption of irrigation fluid. None of our patients needed transfusions or intensive care perioperatively. Further complications were not severe and could be handled without problems. In two patients with large benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) a second operation (VLAP, no conventional transurethral prostatectomy) was necessary. After 6 weeks, 29.4 % of the patients suffered from symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTI). After 6 months, only 7.1 % of the patients had symptomatic UTI. After 6 weeks (n = 61), Qmax. was 6-34 ml/s (mean 15.3 ml/s), RUV was 0-230 ml (mean 51.5 ml), and the IPSS was 12.3 (8-28). After 3 months (n = 54), Qmax. was 9-45 ml/s (mean 19.8 ml/s), RUV was 0-96 ml (mean 31.6 ml), and the IPSS was 1-23 (mean 7.4). After 6 months (n = 52) Qmax. was 12-33 ml/s (mean 20.4 ml), RUV was 0-53 ml (mean 26.4 ml), and the IPSS was 1-12 (mean 4.1). VLAP provided no further risks for our high-risk patients, while Qmax., RUV, and IPSS were improved noticeably (improvement of more than 75 %). It represents a step forward in the treatment of obstructive BPH in high-risk patients. Particularly in high-risk patients with cardiac diseases, this procedure lessens the perioperative risk. Despite the minimal appearance of UTI after 6 months, UTI seemed to be the most important complication during the first few weeks after VLAP by virtue of the bothersome symptoms.
