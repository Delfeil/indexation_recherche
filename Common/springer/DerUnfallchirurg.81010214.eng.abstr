Fractures of the cuboid are very rare. During the last 10 years four patients with isolated fractures of the cuboid have been treated in our hospital. The displaced fractures were treated by open reduction, bone grafting where necessary, and internal fixation. At the time of follow-up the results concerning pain and function were good to excellent and better than those previously reported for conservative treatment. We recommend this treatment for fractures with displacement of one or more of the articular surfaces or with shortening of the lateral arch of the foot.
