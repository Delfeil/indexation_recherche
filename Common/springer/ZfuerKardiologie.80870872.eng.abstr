  Objectives: In a retrospective study the effect of a combined pretreatment using ticlopidine and aspirin (ASA) in patients undergoing elective PTCA procedures was investigated with respect to in-hospital complications of PTCA and with respect to the efficacy in avoiding a subacute stent thrombosis in case of stent implantation. The systematically performed pretreatment with ticlopidine and ASA takes the delayed begin of full antiplatelet effect of ticlopidine into account.
