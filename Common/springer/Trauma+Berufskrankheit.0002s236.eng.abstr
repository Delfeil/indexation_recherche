There are several steps in the diagnosis of fresh spinal injuries. At the site of the accident there is a rough ascertainment of neurological findings with a clinical examination. After the injured person has been admitted to hospital a basic imaging diagnosis is made by means of X-ray investigations of the injured segment of the spine in two plains and a further, more thorough, neurological diagnostic examination is carried out. The basic examination consists in X-ray examination in the a-p and lateral planes. If the clinical symptoms and the basic X-ray examinations suggest a spinal injury or if the extent of a spinal injury is not clear further diagnostic procedures are necessary: conventional tomography, oblique X-ray examinations, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance tomography (MRT). A further important step is the examination of concomitant injuries. Particularly in the case of injuries to the upper and mid-thoracic section of the spine and at the thoracolumbar junction, injuries of the rib cage, the shoulder girdle and the thoracic and upper abdominal organs are often also present. A spinal injury must be expected in up to 30% of polytraumatized patients. The use of spiral CT allows simultaneous and rapid diagnosis of spinal injuries and of concomitant injuries specifically in this group of patients, and such a diagnosis is valuable in assessment of the prognosis. The introduction of core spin tomography has made further improvements in the diagnosis of spinal trauma possible. MRT is better than CT for visualization and assessment of the surrounding soft tissues and the content of the spinal canal. At present, conventional myelography is still indicated for visualization of spinal canal stenoses, for intraoperative monitoring following spinal canal revision and for postoperative monitoring following the insertion of implants for internal fixation. SCIWORA syndrome (spinal cord injury without radiological abnormalities) in paediatric patients is a special case as far as diagnosis is concerned. This cannot be adequately investigated and diagnosed except by MRT. Myelography, ultrasonography and instrumental palpation can be used for intraoperative diagnosis following spinal canal revision.
