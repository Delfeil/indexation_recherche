In this article we report a very rare case of simultaneous and bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendon in a 38-year-old patient. The initial diagnosis was "herniated vertebral disk". Although there was an extensive neurological and psychiatric examination in combination with several operations, it took almost 3 months until the real reason was found. In this case report we describe our postoperative treatment of early mobilization and compare it with other therapies.
