In Germany, there is a special situation that racemic dl-methadone and the (biologically effective) l-form (levomethadone) are both used as a substitute for heroin. The therapeutic effect of methadone is stereo-specific and the metabolism is also enantioselective. Therefore an approach to the dose-effect relationship of methadone requires an enantioselective analytical separation. For this a HPLC method was optimised especially for post-mortem blood samples. After liquid/liquid extraction with 1-chlorobutane, the extract was separated on a column combination of 4 cm CN and 10 cm chiral AGP phases with the solvent AcN/ 0.01 M PO4 buffer pH 5.0/ dimethyloctlyamine (15/85/0.5). The methadone enantiomers elute baseline separated at approx. 15 min (l-form) and 18 min (d-form). The two EDDP-enantiomers and drugs which are frequently consumed supplementary to methadone such as heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics etc. , do not interfere with detection. With this method the methadone l/d-ratio was determined in 93 serum samples from living addicts and 106 post-mortem blood samples from drug deaths. From the l/d-ratio and the concentration of total methadone as determined by other methods (GC-MS or RP-HPLC) the l-methadone concentration was calculated. In approximately 50% of the post-mortem samples the l-methadone concentration was higher than 0.3 mg/l, whereas this level was exceeded in only one of the living persons. If dl-methadone was taken, the individual l/d-ratio in blood samples from living as well as deceased persons differed greatly ranging from approx. 25/75 to 75/25, with a mean of 50/50. In samples from 1999, l-methadone was found exclusively in approx. 20% of the cases. In some cases it was obvious that both l- and dl-methadone had been used. Fatal cases with high l-methadone concentrations (>1 mg/l) gave rise to concern, because the l/d-ratio greatly exceeded 50/50in all cases . This could be considered as an indication of an individually extremely slow metabolism of l-methadone in these cases, resulting in an accumulation of l-methadone. These examples from the forensic casework demonstrate the necessity of an enantioselective quantification of l-methadone as used for therapeutic drug monitoring and in forensic cases.
