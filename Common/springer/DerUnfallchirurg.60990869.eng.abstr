At the university hospital of emergency surgery in Innsbruck and at the emergency services department of the hospital in Schwaz, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was performed in 467 patients between January 1992 and September 1993. In 117 cases, a double semitendinous tendon was used as an autograft. A total of 60 of these patients were followed up at an average of 20 months (13 - 33) after reconstruction. The results were rated according to the OAK and the Tegner scores. Objective measurements of instability were carried out by a KT 1000 arthrometer. In addition, 21 patients underwent computer-interfaced dynometer testing using a Cybex 6000. Standardized loading of the thigh muscles was performed at angular velocities of 60 °/s (3 repetitions) and 240 °/s (30 repetitions); peak torques and total work were analyzed. The mean age was 23.5 years (17 - 55); 48 were male, 21 female. The main reasons for the ACL ruptures were sports injuries (51 cases). The patients were classified into three groups according to the data of the repair (group 1: reconstruction up to 1 week after trauma - 28 patients; group 2: reconstruction between the 2nd and 6th week after trauma - 15 patients; group 3: reconstruction 6 and more weeks after trauma - 26 patients). In group 1, additional ruptures of the menisci, lesions of the MCL, and chondromalacia were seen in 71.4%, in group 2 in 73.3% and in group 3 in 80.8%. The average rating in the OAK score was 90.16 points; 38 patients (55.70%) had excellent results, 18 (26.09%) were good, 9 (13.04%) were fair and 4 (5.80%) were poor. The Tegner activity score showed a reduction of 0.36 points on average. The largest amount of anterior translation was performed with the KT 1000 manual drawer test (2.29 mm on average compared with the contralateral side). Dynamometer testing showed a statistically significant difference in flexor and extensor mechanism (compared with the noninvolved side) in both peak torques and total work. A repeat arthroscopy became necessary in five cases: arthrofibrosis in three and incipient joint infection in two cases.
