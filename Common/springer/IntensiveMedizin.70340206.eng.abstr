 Paracetamol (Acetaminophen, N-acetyl-para-aminophenol) ingestion is the commonest reported cause of intensional drug overdose in both the United States and the United Kingdom but despite the large number of overdose cases severe complications occur in a relatively small percentage. Severe hepatotoxicity can be anticipated in any individual who has a serum paracetamol level above the standard treatment line or who has ingested more than the minimum hepatotoxic dose of 125 mg/kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a 60 kg individual). In these cases treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be commenced as soon as possible. In addition, every patient where either the size or timing of the overdose is unclear should receive a full course of N-acetylcysteine regardless of their serum levels. In all cases where N-acetylcysteine has been started it should be continued if there is evidence of worsening hepatic function. At the earliest sign of severe hepatotoxicity a specialist liver unit should be contacted to ensure optimal management or immediate transfer if there is a likelihood that acute liver failure may develop. Liver transplantation in the most severe cases has significantly improved the outcome of a previously unsalvageable group of patients but a further improvement in outcome can only be achieved by closer cooperation between referring hospitals and specialist liver units.
