  From January 1996 untill February 1997 6,376 patients were treated by our group with PTCA and 3,859 (60.5%) received one or several stents. An angiographic follow up was achieved in 63% of the patients with 1,267 experiencing restenosis (32.8%). Of those beeing treated with re-PTCA 302 were randomly selected for further analysis. In-stent-restenosis was treated with rotablator in 8 patients (2.7%), with eximer laser in 21 (7.0%) and with another stent in 48 patients (15.9%). 225 patients (74.4%) of this subselection were treated with balloonangioplasty only.
