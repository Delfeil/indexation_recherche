 In the course of an infection with human immunodeficiency virus, a large variety of complications affecting all organ systems can occur. However, complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare. In the case presented we report a 67-year-old HIV-seropositive patient who underwent surgery for a huge abscess in the thigh. Intraoperatively unexpectedly we found a mycotic aneurysm of the femoral superficial artery and the causactive bacterium proved to be Salmonella enteritidis. Because of the rising number of HIV-infected patients we suspect that the amount of complications involving the vascular system and demanding surgical intervention will also increase. Therefore, when diagnosing and deciding on therapy for patients with AIDS, the physician must be awaren that vascular complications due as a result of HIV infection might occur more frequently in the future.
