Scar sarcoidosis is one of the rare cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis. Apart from the clinical picture, suppression of the cell-mediated immunity can often be determined when tuberculin tests and testing for recall antigens are carried out. In the present case of a 68-year-old woman patient scar sarcoidosis and pulmonary sarcoidosis were detected. Remarkably, a strongly positive tuberculin reaction was found, while acute tuberculosis and former BCG vaccination were excluded. Both references in the literature and the case presented demonstrate that a positive tuberculin test, while very unusual in sarcoidosis, does not however, preclude the diagnosis. On the basis of some case reports in the literature, our patient was treated with allopurinol; impressive improvement of both the skin and the pulmonary manifestations was noted. Despite the well-known phenomenon of spontaneous regression in sarcoidosis, we recommend a clinical trial with allopurinol as this substance is well tolerated.
