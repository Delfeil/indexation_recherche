  Myasthenia gravis (MG) in about 80% of cases is associated with pathological alterations of the thymus. These alterations are described here with reference to distinct models of autoimmunization against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). In MG with thymitis intrathymic production of AChR-specific autoantibodies is the result of a classical antigendriven immune reaction that occurs completely inside the thymus and probably involves AChR on myoid cells as the myasthenogenic antigen. In thymoma-associated MG, intratumorous autoantibody production does not occur and intratumorous T cell activation is exceptional. Instead, abnormally hyperexpressed proteins in conjunction with abnormally low MCH class II levels may trigger autoantigen-specific, non-tolerogenic T cell selection by neoplastic epithelial cells, followed by export of potentially autoreactive T cells to extratumorous sites. Thus, the initial steps in the pathogenesis of most MG cases take place within abnormal thymic microenvironments, be they inflammatory or neoplastic. The different pathogenetic mechanisms imply that MG is an early symptom in thymitis but a late symptom in thymoma patients. Early srgery after onset of MG is essential in thymitis to prevent "dissemination" of autoreactive T cells to extrathymic organs and to improve MG symptoms. By contrast, "dissemination" of autoreactive T cells has already happend during many months or years before a given thymoma becomes symptomatic. As a consequence, surgery in thymoma patients aims mainly at the oncological and local cardiovascular complications of thymomas but rarely achieves alleviation of MG symptoms.
