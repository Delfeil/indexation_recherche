We report the clinical and laboratory results of a family where one boy and one girl presented with a clinical picture resembling the X-linked agammaglobulinemia known as Bruton's disease. Both children showed severe bacterial infections starting at the age of around 6 months, a lack of all immunoglobulin classes and absence of mature B-cells in the peripheral blood. With respect to reports from the literature these results are yet another indicator for the existence of an autosomal-recessiv disorder with the same clinical make-up as Bruton's disease. A deletion on chromosome 14 leading to the disorder was identified.
