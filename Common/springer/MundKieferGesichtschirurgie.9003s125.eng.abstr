A comparative study was carried out of 276 Brånemark fixtures in the irradiated and nonirradiated anterior mandible with a mean follow-up period of 58.2 months. Postoperative radiotherapy with 60 Gy and 100% isodose for the anterior mandible using a 6-MV linear accelerator, conventional fractioning, and a split-course technique was administered in the irradiated patient group. HBO therapy was not applied. A statistical difference in the 5-year success rate between the irradiated and nonirradiated group was not found. Nevertheless, a significantly higher rate of perioperative soft tissue complications at implant insertion was seen in the irradiated group. The statistical analysis showed no significance for sex, interval between radiation and implant insertion (with a minimun of 10 months), or type of periimplant soft tissue (regional vs. flap). The prognosis for implants in the irradiated mandible was, however, statistically improved (n = 0.0035) when the healing period was longer than 4 months. Mobile periimplant soft tissue proved to be the main problem regardless of radiation load. Late complications have not been observed so far. The available results and clinical studies support a positive assessment of the regenerative potential of the irradiated mandible with regard to osteointegration of endosseous implants. A preceding radiotherapy up to 60 Gy should therefore not be considered as a contraindication for an implant/prosthetic rehabilitation.
