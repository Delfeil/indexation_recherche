As laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established, interest in legal aspects increases. The legal cases dealt with in Germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in 1989 were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications. Of 40 cases, 16 were judged to be cases of malpractice, whereas 24 were not. The most common cause was injury of the common bile duct (26 cases). Seven of these 26 cases were judged to be cases of malpractice, 2 of these as grave errors. The main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy, delayed revision, laparoscopic revisions and not reverting to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations.
