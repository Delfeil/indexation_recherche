As it is the driving force in the development of a multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), the gastro-intestinal region is at the centre of current discussion. Recently, hepatovenous oximetry has been used increasingly to monitor the relationship between oxygen supply and consumption in the splanchnic system. In the present paper we report an exclusively oximetrically controlled catheterisation procedure that can be carried out at the bedside without the use of imaging procedures. In the inferior vena cava a typical venous oxygen saturation profile can be expected. Near the opening of renal veins there is a peak in venous saturation due to the large extent to which the kidneys partake in the cardiac output and their relatively low oxygen consumption. Correspondingly there is a significant drop in saturation in the area around the opening of the hepatic veins. At the right atrium the oxygen saturation increases again due to admixing of more highly saturated blood from the superior vena cava. Taking these physiological facts into consideration it was attempted to find the opening of the hepatic veins into the inferior vena cava using only continuous in vivo oximetry and to insert a hepatovenous catheter.
