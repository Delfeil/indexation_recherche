Incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear. Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is characterized as an acute, protein-rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure. NPE is infrequently diagnosed, usually in association with head trauma. Pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left-atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability. In contrast to NPE, cardiac complications are frequently observed, most consistently in patients with subarachoid hemorrhage. Typical ECG changes are repolarization abnormalities, similar to those observed in coronary heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. The CK-MB may be slightly elevated; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left-ventricular function. Pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis. Cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines. For adequate treatment, close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions.
