 A menstrual migraine occurs in approximately 7-10 % of women suffering from migraine. The migraine occurs from 2 days before until 3 days after the end of the menstrual period. The choice of treatment depends on the duration of the attack, which ranges from 3 to 7 days. An attack of up to 3 days duration should be treated with acetylsalicylic acid, ergotamine tartrate or naproxen, each in combination with an antiemetic (domperidone, metoclopramide). If there is no response, sumatriptan can be administered orally (25-100 mg) or subcutaneously (6 mg). In the attacks continue for more than 3 days, short-term prophylaxis with naproxen or the application of an estrogen-containing patch is indicated. Neither ovulation inhibitors nor traditional migraine prophylaxis has an influence on menstrual migraine. Patients should keep a headache diary. Short-term prophylaxis with ergotamine tartrate or tamoxifen is obsolete.
