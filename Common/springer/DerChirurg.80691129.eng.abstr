 Teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work-up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics. Due to more complex therapeutic strategies and legally defined formal requirements, the need for teleconsultation will increase significantly in the future. Rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation (based upon an ISDN network in the beginning, later on by the use of a national health network). The medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery. However, the question of adequate financial compensation for this type of medical service is still unclear.
