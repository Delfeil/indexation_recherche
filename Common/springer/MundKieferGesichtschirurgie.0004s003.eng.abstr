The recognition of a medical discipline on a European level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the European Union. With supreme effort, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the EU reached this goal in 1989. The UEMS - Section of Stomatology and Oromaxillofacial Surgery - became the forum for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and officials of the European Commission. Thanks to its activities, oral and maxillofacial surgery is now recognized as an independent specialty with about 3800 specialists in 11 European countries.
