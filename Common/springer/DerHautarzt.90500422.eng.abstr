The aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria. Moreover, the patients' motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined. 228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies (ins), food intolerance (food), drug hypersensitivities (dru) and urticaria (urt) were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments. Patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance. Patient education was the favourite technique for the patients (food 78%, urt 57%, dru 24%, ins 17%), followed by relaxation treatment. The most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self-responsibility, a feeling of helplessness and social limitations. If strong indication criteria are applied, psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group. In spite of that, the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support.
