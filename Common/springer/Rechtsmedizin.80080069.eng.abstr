 The results of a systematical histological investigation of the conducting system from 100 autopsy cases are presented. Regularly a "tubular myopathy" (vacuolar degeneration of the sarcoplasm) could be shown if an agonal cardiac or non-cardiac hypoxaemia occurred. The presence of a "tubular myopathiy" with exclusion of a non-cardiac cause of death allows the diagnosis of a sudden heart failure due to an arrhythmia. The correctness of this diagnosis will be even more probable if the coronary arteries are altered e.g. by arteriosclerosis. A simple technique for preparation and histological examination is presented.
