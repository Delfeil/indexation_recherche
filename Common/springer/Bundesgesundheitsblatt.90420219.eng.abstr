The increasing importance of Lyme-Borreliosis in Saxony was the reason to perform this study with the intention to get information about the infection rate of ticks with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The infection rate was determined by PCR and testing slide-fixed ticks by immunofluorescence. For this analysis 3234 ticks from Saxony and neighbouring regions were collected and investigated. 252 of 1378 ticks checked by immunofluorescence were positive (18,3%), 440 of 1856 ticks examined by PCR were infected (23,7%). 50 ticks with multiple infection by several genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi were found. The importance of these findings and possible conclusions are discussed.
