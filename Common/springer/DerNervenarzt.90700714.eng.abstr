In four patients presenting with acute nontraumatic intracerebral or intraspinal hemorrhage, T2*-weighted gradient-echo MRI showed numerous residual hemosiderin deposits due to old intracerebral hemorrhages that were missed on initial CT and spin-echo MRI. The demonstration of additional chronic bleedings and their anatomical distribution provided important diagnostic information. In a hypertensive patient, the hemosiderin deposits were most pronounced within deep brain structures suggesting hypertensive cerebral microangiopathy. In a second patient, the cortico-subcortical distribution of the hemorrhages was typical of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In a third patient, the diffuse distribution including spinal bleeding, the marked calcification, and the characteristic appearance on spin-echo MRI were consistent with multiple cavernomas. In another patient with cerebral and spinal hemorrhage, T2*-weighted gradient-echo MRI revealed new subclinical hemorrhages during follow-up. Based on these findings, we recommend that T2*-weighted gradient-echo MRI of the brain should be performed in all patients with acute intracranial and spinal bleedings.
