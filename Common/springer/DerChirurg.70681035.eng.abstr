 A 68-year-old woman suffering from severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding underwent an urgent laparotomy. A necrotizing cholecystitis was found. The source of the bleeding was the eroded cystic artery. Perforation of a giant gallstone led to a fistula into the duodenum. The gallstone was removed from the distal jejunum. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Later on a choledochal stenosis had to be treated by stenting. One year after the procedure the patient is alive and well.
