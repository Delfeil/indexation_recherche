 There is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance. Intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enables Doppler measurement of mitral inflow pattern (E/A ratio). The E/A ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation. In the present study we compared the time course of the E/A ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation () assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). After ethical approval, 12 patients undergoing CABG surgery were studied. Measurements of the E/A ratio and  were performed after induction of anesthesia (I), immediately prior to CPB with the pericardium open (II), 5 min after CPB (III), and after sternal closure (IV). Time constant of myocardial relaxation was calculated as the reciprocal value of the slope of the left ventricular dP/dt and left ventricular pressure plot. The E/A ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery (IV). In contrast,  was increased immediately after CPB, but decreased after sternal closure (IV). Cardiac index and heart rate both increased after CPB. The results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after CPB, as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation. However,  improved rapidly to pre-CPB values. The E/A ratio alone failed to detect the initial post-CPB alteration in left ventricular relaxation.
