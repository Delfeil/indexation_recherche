Introduction: In recent years most industrialized nations have been confronted with a dramatic increase in cases dealing with back pain which, because of the associated costs, has put a strain on health care systems. Because of the tremendous costs caused by patients with chronic illnesses, there is a common interest in identifying determinants responsible for the pain becoming chronic. According to the fear-avoidance model, chronic back pain is the cause of specific patient beliefs according to their perception and appraisal of back pain and their assumptions about the connection between pain and work activities. These fear-avoidance beliefs are assumed as the main cognitive factors of adapting to chronic invalidism. In this study a German version of a self-reporting instrument that assesses fear-avoidance beliefs (FABQ, Waddell et al. 1993) is presented.
