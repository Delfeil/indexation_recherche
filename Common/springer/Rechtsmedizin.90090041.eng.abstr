 In this complete documentation of the early published and unpublished reports of the medico-legal use of arthropods (forensic entomology) we give an overview over the initial work of the German and French forensic scientists Mégnin, Reinhard and Hofmann who were the founders of the discipline (since 1881) and the work performed shortly after which was influenced by them. We show that the initial difficulty in determining postmortem intervals of corpses led past scientists to look closely at the effects of the insect fauna on buried corpses. Furthermore we report an observation of Leclercq which confirms an ancient forensic entomology case reported by Sung T'zu in the thirteenth century.
