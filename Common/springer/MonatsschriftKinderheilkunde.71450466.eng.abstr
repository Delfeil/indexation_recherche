Idiopathic congenital QT syndrome in childhood often presents with cardiac arrest, syncope and seizures. Symptomatic patients are basically treated with beta blocking agents. Additional pacemaker implantation or left cardiac sympathetic denervation may be helpful for non responders. We present a successful implantation of an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator in a 95/12 year old boy.  Discussion: Due to lower weight and volume devices and new transvenous rate-sensing and defibrillation spring electrodes this therapy may be feasible and effective even in younger pediatric patients.
