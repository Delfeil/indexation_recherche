The possibilities of using different material combinations for the replacement of knee joint endoprostheses are very limited. Therefore, cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys are currently being used for femoral components and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene for tribologically stressed tibial components. Titanium alloys can be considered for the tibial component only.
