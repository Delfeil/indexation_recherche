ACL reconstruction with patellar tendon autograft is a standard procedure which can be performed arthroscopically with a femoral half tunnel drilled from the joint or using the two-tunnel technique with medial miniarthrotomy and additional femoral approach. The arthroscopic procedure with single incision was supposed to increase stability and to improve proprioception by earlier rehabilitation. 29 patients with ACL deficiency were included in the study. 15 patients were treated endoscopically, 14 patients by using the two-tunnel technique. Proprioception, Lysholm and Tegner scores as well as stability (KT-1000) were assessed preoperatively, 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
