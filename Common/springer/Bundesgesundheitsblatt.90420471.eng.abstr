In a retrospective study examination- and spermiogram-data were collected from 3821 men. The data came from the vicinity of the andrological department of the Leipzig university-clinic. It should be examined, whether first-examined patients without anamnestic or abnormal clinical findings did show a deterioration of the sperm-quality within the examination-years 1985 to 1996. Furtheron information should be collected concerning a possible dependence of the spermiogram data from the year of birth. Within the group of the 25 to 34 year old men (n=1650) in the time frame from 1985 until 1996 the absolute sperm count of 195 millions changed to 138 millions, the sperm concentration of 79,7 was reduced to 52,6 Mio/ml and the fraction of morphological normal sperm was diminished from 64,6% to 59,6% (all results with p<0,001). With increasing birth-year sperm count as well as sperm concentration decreased. The causes for the observed decrease remain unresolved.
