 Surgeons treating a patient with lower abdominal pain of uncertain etiology are caught between the extrems of conservative and operative treatment. After clinical examination and ultrasonography, explorative laparoscopy has been shown by several studies to solve this therapeutic dilemma. Using laparoscopy prolonged observation, the incidence of perforation and unnecessary laparotomies can be reduced dramatically, in particular, the rate of negative appendectomies is lowered from 30-40 % to about 15 %. This leads to shortened stay in hospital, increased efficiency and decreased financial costs.
