In this paper the problems that arose with the accident at Eschede and the consequent massive number of injured persons present at one time and the decisions made at the scene are presented in chronological order. The aim of these decision was to be operating one-to-one medical care at the earliest possible point after the accident. A total of 87 injured persons were taken away by the rescue services and shared out among 22 hospitals within a circumference of 150 km. This scattered distribution of the injured persons was made possible by the massive mobilization of the air rescue service. By 2 h after the accident most of the injured were on the way to the hospitals or had already reached them. The problems encountered as a result of the massive number of deaths and the procedure followed in Eschede are also presented. A total of 96 bodies were taken from the wreckage at the scene of the accident.
