 A 23 year old male presented with hypertension and a systolic murmur. ECG and echo revealed signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. Aortography showed aortic coarctation (p max. 40mmHg) in combination with an aneurysm originating from the coarcted segment distal from the origin of the left subclavian artery. Coarctation and aneurysm were treated using direct placement of a stent graft and subsequent balloon dilatation. On final aortography, the outline of the stented segment was smooth with good stent apposition and the aneurysm entry was closed. The residual gradient was 10mmHg (max). Six months later, the patient has no symptoms and a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg on both arms.
