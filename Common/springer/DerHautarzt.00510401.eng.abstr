Background and Objective. Psychological problems in children and parents related to children's atopic eczema (AE) may impede the success of treatment. We studied the question, if behavior-based parental education in groups (DPE) or standardized video-education (VPE) could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin-damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers.
