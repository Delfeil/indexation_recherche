 Highly conformal radiotherapy techniques require precise patient positioning. We report our first experience with a new cast system for fixation of the pelvis during stereotactically guided intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of the prostate with respect to positioning accuracy of the prostate.  The immobilization device consists of a custom-made wrap-around body cast that extends from the abdomen to the thighs and a seperate head mask, both made from Scotchcast, and attaches to a frame for extracranial stereotaxy. Sixteen CT-studies (>= 25 slices, thickness: 3 mm) of 2 patients who were immobilized for IMRT of prostate tumors were evaluated with respect to set-up accuracy of bony structures and the prostate itself. CT-studies were performed immediately before or after a treatment fraction. Deviations of bony landmarks and anatomical landmarks inside the planning target volume were measured in all 3 dimensions.  Mean patient movements of 0.15 +/- 0,3 mm (latero-lateral), 0,9 +/- 1mm (anterior-posterior), 1 +/- 1 mm (transversal vectorial error) and < 3 mm slice thickness (craniacaudal) were recorded using bony landmarks and 0,9 +/- 0,9 mm (latero-lateral), 1,8 +/- 1,5 mm (anterior-posterior), 2,2 +/- 1,5 mm (transversal vectorial error) and < 3 mm (craniocaudal) using the confines of, or landmarks within the prostate. Standard deviations of absolute positioning error as an often used metric for positioning accuracy ranged between 0,3 and 1,7 mm in the transversal plane. The worst case transversal vectorial deviation for the prostate was 4,4 mm. Figure 4 summarizes the set-up accuracy of bony landmarks and the prostate.  The presented combination of a body cast and head mask system in a rigid stereotictic body frame ensures reliable noninvasive patient fixation for fractionated extrcranial stereotactic radiotherapy. It provides precise and reliable positioning of the prostate and meets the requirements for highly conformal radiotherapy such as IMRT. No further improvement of reprositioning can be achieved with external immobilization devices since the positioning error of the target relative to the skeleton exceeds the accuracy of the positioning of the skeleton itself.
