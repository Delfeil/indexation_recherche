 We report on a 64-year-old patient with a huge adrenal pseudocyst. These are rare cystic lesions of the adrenal gland with an unclear etiology. Recent studies suggest that the majority of adrenal pseudocysts are of vascular origin. All cystic masses in the epigastric region have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. The treatment of choice is surgical removal.
