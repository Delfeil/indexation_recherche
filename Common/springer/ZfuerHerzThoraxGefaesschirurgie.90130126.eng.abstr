  In Europe, saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery. From the pathogenetic point of view, it is a colonization of preexisting lung or pleural cavities following other severe pulmonary diseases. The incidence amounts to 0.4% among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases. Concerning this review, the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all 66 patients we operated on between 1961 and 1996. Preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult. The majority of patients (77%) are male. There is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand. A higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in agriculture, in the building trade, and in paper mills. Pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47% of the patients. Usually, the tentative diagnosis is based on chest x-ray, especially if hemoptysis is present. Major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma. Clinical presentation and chest x-ray findings are non-characteristic. Nowadays, the typical x-ray of pulmonary aspergilloma, almost always localized in the upper lobes, became a rare finding. If an aspergillus infection is suspected, serologic methods are reliable and sensitive. A surgical procedure is absolutely indicated in patients with major hemoptysis in their history, in case of disease progression or indeterminate mass and in order to avoid fungal dissemination. If a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings, clinical examination, and patient's social history, an operation is justified. Relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the mycotoxins. The lobectomy, if necessary carried out as pleuro-lobectomy, is the adequate resection in most patients (68%). However, this operation is technically demanding and it usually requires a longer operating time as compared to lobectomies for other underlying diseases. Peri- and postoperative complications occur in 60% of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma. A higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections, like segmentectomies or wedge resections, as compared to lobectomies. Persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem. It requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients. The operative mortality rate is 3%. A systemic antifungal therapy is not an appropriate treatment for saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis and can even cause specific complications.
