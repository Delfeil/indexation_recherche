  The aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement (AVR) due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired LV systolic function prior to surgery. 74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (29 female, 45 male, mean age 66  +/-  18 years) were divided into 2 groups according to LV ejection fraction (EF): Group 1 with EF > 50% (n = 40); Group 2 with EF <= 50% (n = 34). Furthermore, patients were differentiated into a group A without (n = 53) and a group B with aortic regurgitation (<= II °, n = 21). All patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 month after surgery. There was a significant decrease of LV enddiastolic and endsystolic valume indices following AVR in group 2 and group B. Patients with preoperatively lower EF (group 2) showed an increase in LV ejection fraction from 39  +/-  10% before AVR to 47  +/-  11% after AVR (p < 0.001), whereas patients with preoperative normal EF (group 1) showed a significant decrease in EF (from 62  +/-  8% to 57  +/-  10%, p < 0.05). Also patients with combined aortic valve disease before AVR had an increase of EF after surgery (from 45 %plusmn; 14% to 56  +/-  14%, p < 0.03). There were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and LV posterior wall thickness in group 1 and group A, whereas a significant decrease of LV anddiastolic diameter index was noted only in group B. Improvement of the NYHA functional class could be demonstrated in group 2 from 2.8  +/-  0.7 before to 2.2  +/-  0.6 after AVR, as well as in group B from 2.9  +/-  0.7 before to 1.9  +/-  0.7 after surgery. In conclusion, patients with impaired LV function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after AVR, while patients with normal LV function presented a slight decrease of EF. There was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status.
