By varying the light spectrum, impulse length, impulse sequences and fluences, the PhotoDermVL allows a large choice of individual treatment parameters. Superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations (essential telangiectases, port-wine stains, Poikiloderma of Civatte, hemangiomatous malformations) and cosmetically bothering hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity polychromatic pulsed light source.
