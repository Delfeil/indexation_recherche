The method using transvers retubularized segment of ileum as an efferent conduit in Hautmann's neobladder is easy to perform and it an be repeated in revision procedures. We performed the procedure in nine patients who underwent radical cystectomy. At 8-16 months after operation, the resulting stomas were easy to catheterize. Of the nine patients, eight were continent. We find the procedure to be a good alternative when the appendix is absent and a cutaneous stoma is needed. It could be the prefered method in ileal neobladders with cutaneous outlet.
