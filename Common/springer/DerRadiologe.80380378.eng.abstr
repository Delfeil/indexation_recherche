The aim of this study was to evaluate the sonographic anatomy of the elbow joint in children and adults and to point out the indications for an ultrasound examination after elbow joint trauma. The study was carried out using isolated joint specimens, muscle specimens and cadaver limbs. Additionally, a clinical trial was performed using high-resolution ultrasound probes (7.5-12 MHz). When assessing standard sections, one has to consider both the position of the elbow joint in the frontal plane and the position of the forearm during pro- and supination. The outstanding advantage of this method, especially in children, is the possibility ofa dynamic examination with evaluation of the articular cartilage and with a comparison to the healthy contralateral elbow joint.
