Background: The gold standard for the diagnosis of glycogen storage disease type Ia is still the enzyme assay necessitating fresh liver tissue. In 1993, the gene encoding for the human phosphatase (G-6-Pase) of the glucose-6-phosphatase system was isolated and consequently, mutations have been identified in glycogen storage disease type Ia patients. We analysed the G-6-Pase gene of 18 patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia. The diagnosis had previously been established by the enzyme assay in 13 patients. The remaining 5 patients were diagnosed on the basis of the clinical presentation.
