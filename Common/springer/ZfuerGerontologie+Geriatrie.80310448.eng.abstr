  Within the longitudinal study on nutrition and health status in an aging population of Giessen, Germany, baseline measurements with regard to antioxidant status were obtained in 85 free living elderly persons. The subjects were at least 60 years old, non-smoking, feeding themselves, and not supplementing any vitamins or minerals. Dietary intake of nutrients was assessed by means of a 3-day estimated food record, which was especially developed and validated for this study. Antioxidant status was evaluated by fasting plasma concentrations of vitamin C, E, -carotene, and selenium. The results show that in this study group self-determined nutrition provides enough nutrients to yield a good antioxidant status in the advanced age. Although no differences could be detected in dietary intake of vitamin C, E, and -carotene between males and females, significantly higher plasma concentrations of all substances investigated were found in females when compared to males.
