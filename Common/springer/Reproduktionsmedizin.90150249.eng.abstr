German in vitro fertilisation (IVF) groups have been voluntarily participating in a national IVF register since 1982 and in 1997 seventy five centres sent their results to this register. Since 1998 participation has become mandatory. Prior to 1997 results could be forwarded as a written compilation or as D-base file, but since 1997 only computerised files have been used. The catalogue of items covers all aspects of IVF treatment which could be completed in a retrospective or prospective manner. Overall, 37 962 treatment cycles were reported to the German IVF register, 8387 of them being collected prospectively. While in the retrospective analysis pregnancy rate per transfer was calculated to be 24.4 % for IVF and 23.3 % for IVF with ICSI, these rates dropped to 18.5 % per transfer for both treatment modalities in the prospective data. Although a retrospective database of over 30.000 treatment cycles may provide interesting information, such as the fact that over 70 % of these treatments were performed according to the socalled long agonistic protocol, retrospective compilation of data will never lead to a reliable register, whether national or international. As with scientific studies, prospective database, capturing information from the beginning of egg stimulation is preferable. This should allow the register to become a reliable instrument for measurement of quality control.
