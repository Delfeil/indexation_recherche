 The ca. 1000 drug-related fatalities that were examined in Hamburg from 1990-1996 by the Institute of Legal Medicine were analysed with respect to consumption of substitute drugs such as methadone. The incidence of methadone-related fatalities has increased in the last two years. The highest incidence was found in 1995 when methadone was detected in the blood of about 20% of all drug-related fatalities. Lethal monointoxications or combined intoxications with a dominant role of methadone were experienced rarely (about 1% of all drug-related fatalities). Of the persons who were enroled since 1990 in a methadone maintenance programme 2% have been registered as drug- related fatalities. The mortality of street addicts without comparable medical help was about 10% in the same period. There is further need for improved methods of registration, documentation and forensic/sociological analysis of all drug-related fatalities for reliable conclusions concerning mortality rates of drug users who are enroled in methadone maintenance programmes.
