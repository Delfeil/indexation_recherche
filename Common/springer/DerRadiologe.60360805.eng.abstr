 The prognosis of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children is mainly influenced by early diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotic and surgical therapy. In this age group, two forms of manifestation are differentiated: osteomyelitis in infants up to 18 months and juvenile osteomyelitis until the closure of the epiphyseal plate. Osteomyelitis in infants is often accompanied by septic arthritis of the adjacent joint. In juvenile osteomyelitis, the disease is mostly confined to the metaphysis. Plain films and ultrasonography represent the basic imaging modalities. Depending on the age of the child, the clinical course of the disease and the availability of the various methods, MRI and multiphase bone scintigraphy can be performed for further imaging. CT is of only limited value and should only be used for special cases concerning chronic osteomyelitis.
