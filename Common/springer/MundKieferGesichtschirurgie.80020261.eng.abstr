A possible correlation between the thermal effects of the weather and the frequency of odontogenic soft-tissue infections was investigated with special regard to the so-called felt temperature (gT). Clinical data of 2111 patients of the years 1992-1996 in whom an incision was made because of an odontogenic soft-tissue infection were evaluated retrospectively and correlated to meteorological data for Aachen, collected or calculated by the "Deutsche Wetterdienst". In order to describe the thermal exchange between the human organism and the surroundings in a satisfactory way, the gT was chosen. The gT is a complexly calculated meteorological parameter which allows physiologically adequate estimation of the thermic surroundings of humans.
