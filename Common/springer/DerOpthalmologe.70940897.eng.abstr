Background: Problems with epithelial healing are the main cause of corneal graft failure in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency. This post-operative complication cannot be eliminated by conventional penetrating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbal grafting, which is, however, highly immunogenic. We report here our 3 years' experience with a new surgical procedure which we developed called homologous central limbo-keratoplasty.
