Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method for the detection of chromosomal imbalances between a tumor and a normal genome. In order to produce quantitative and reproducible results, we developed an image analysis program that allows the detection and mapping of the genetic alterations. The result is represented as a CGH sum karyogram in which the genetic changes are documented as color coded-chromosomes. The aim of our investigation is to correlate the genotype with the phenotype on the basis of CGH sum karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization that will supplement the morphological tumor description.
