The contribution gives the outlines of a treatment approach for guided affective imagery based on analytical and systemic sources. It draws on analytic short-term therapy in concentrating therapeutic work on a specific focus and actively shaping the therapeutic relationship. The classical conception of focus is widened through a perspective on resources and aims and transformed into a bipolar development-centred focus. Likewise, the therapeutic repertoire is enlarged by techniques of intervention from guided affective imagery designed to actualise conflicts and to activate resources and aims. The resulting clinical procedure is illustrated by a case study.
