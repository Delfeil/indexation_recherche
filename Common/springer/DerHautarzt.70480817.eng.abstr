We surgically treated twenty patients with axillary hyperhidrosis by liposuction using tumescent regional anesthesia. After a description of the surgical technique results are presented. Except for trivial hematomas, no complications were seen. Every patient noted a significant reduction of sweat gland activity in the follow up period. Long-term results remain to be seen.
