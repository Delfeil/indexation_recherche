The cell activity of human bone derived cell cultures was studied after mechanical stimulation by cyclic strain at a magnitude occurring in physiologically loaded bone tissue. Monolayers of subconfluently grown human bone derived cells were stretched in rectangular silicone dishes with cyclic uniaxial movement along their longitudinal axes. Strain was applied over two days for 30 min per day with a frequency of 1 Hz and a strain magnitude of 1000 µstrain. Cyclic stretching of the cells resulted in an increased proliferation (10-48 %) and carboxyterminal collagen type I propeptide release (7-49 %) of human cancellous bone derived osteoblasts while alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin release were significantly reduced by 9-25 % and 5-32 % respectively. These results demonstrate that cyclic strain at physiologic magnitude leads to an increase of osteoblast activities related to matrix production while those activities which are characteristic for the differentiated osteoblast and relevant for matrix mineralization are decreased.
