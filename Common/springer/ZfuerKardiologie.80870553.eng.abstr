  A coronary artery perforation is a rare complication after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The therapy will be determined by the hemodynamic failure of the left or right ventricle. A case of a coronary artery perforation with a shunt from the right coronary artery to the right ventricle after coronary angioplasty is reported. The shunt was detected by coronary angiography and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and doppler echocardiograpy.
