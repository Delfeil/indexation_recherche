This retrospective study shows the results in 30 patients of revision surgery on their reruptured ACL. The follow-up time was 30 months on average (range 10 - 54 months). The follow-up examination included subjective (Lysholm score, Tegner activity level rating score), clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer. The overall evaluation was done according to the IKDC score. The follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on ACL. The IKDC score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results, which demonstrated that revision ACL surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery. Nevertheless, we recommend reconstruction of a torn ACL even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration.
