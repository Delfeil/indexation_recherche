To compare patient dose and image quality of electron-beam-CT vs. spiral-CT by means of phantom measurements. An EBCT scanner (C-150 XP) and a spiral-CT scanner (GE  HiSpeed Advantage) were used to scan three different phantoms. Administered dose, high contrast (HC) resolution, low contrast (LC) lesion detectability and the width of the radiation beams were measured. EBCT showed 25-35% lower HC resolution in comparison to spiral-CT. LC lesion detectability showed equivalent results for S/N vs. patient dose using 3 mm collimation with EBCT and spiral-CT, whereas spiral-CT was superior for 1,5 and 6 mm collimation. Dose measurements revealed a 2 fold higher patient dose using EBCT with 1,5 mm or 6 mm collimation compared to spiral-CT using equivalent scan parameters. No differences were seen using 3 mm collimation. Differences were due to insufficient beamside collimation of the EBCT. The use of EBCT with 6 mm collimation should be avoided, because of impaired performance. Using 3 mm collimation, EBCT showed comparable performance like state of the art spiral-CT despite lower HC resolution.
