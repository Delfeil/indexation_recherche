A 56 year old mentally disabled woman of short stature was admitted to our hospital because of severe chest pain and dyspnoea. An extended myocardial infarction in the anterior wall was clinically found and confirmed by autopsy. On admission cretinism with massive myxedema was diagnosed, which was confirmed by subsequent laboratory findings. Only at the base of the tongue thyroid tissue 3 mm in diameter was found. In the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland areas with nodular hyperplasia and microadenomas of TSH-producing cells were detected. Thyrotroph adenomas in long standing hypothyroidism are rare. There are only few reports on congenital hypothyroidism as primary underlying disease.
