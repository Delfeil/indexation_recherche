Audit in outpatient psychotherapy in Germany has been based largely on the assessment of individual patients applying for financial support by their insurance company. Surveys on greater samples of patients are lacking. The study presented gives an overview on patients and interventions in private practice psychotherapy in a non representative sample of 40 psychotherapists in South-West Germany. Over a three-months period 800 patients in psychotherapeutic treatment were included. 500 patients answered questionnaires on their treatment process and outcome. The results of the study are reported in two sections: Section 1 describes patients and psychotherapists participating in the study. Section 2 reports on treatment process and outcome. The results are extensively discussed in section 2.
