 In a population-based study of 110 women between 53 and 82 years of age (mean age 64.5 +/- 7.9 years) static posturography data were compared to functional items of gait and balance in common geriatric mobility scales. Posturographic data of double-stance with eyes open and eyes closed (DSEO; DSEC) did not differ from those of a group of healthy women previously tested for intact nervous system function. The total neuromuscular score - roughly corresponding to the well-known Tinetti score - did not correlate to the posturographic measures. DSEC correlated with the items "rapid walking" and "single-stance left leg". Age, vision, and neuropsychologic test results correlated with DSEO, "rapid walking", "single-stance right leg", "single-stance left leg", and "walking a figure eight". Multiple linear regression confirmed the impact of age, vision, DSEO, and DSEC on "rapid walking" with a 34% variance explanation. Posturographic parameters did predict other selected gait and balance items. When used in older women living independently in the community, parameters of static posturography reflect to some extent the functional disabilities of gait and balance.
