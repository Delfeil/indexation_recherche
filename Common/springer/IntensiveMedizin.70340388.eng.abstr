 The principles of nutritional therapy, i. e., to maintain lean body mass, to stimulate immunocompetence and reparatory functions such as wound healing, are similar for patients with acute renal failure and with other catabolic clinical conditions. The objectives, however, differ from those for patients with chronic renal failure because diets that satisfy minimal requirements will not be sufficient for an acute catabolic illness.
