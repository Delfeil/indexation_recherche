 In cardiac emergencies, the correct diagnosis of the underlying cause is the first step to optimal treatment. For accurate and effective decision-making in cardiac emergencies, careful search for clues during the physical examination and an informed and systematic approach to the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is necessary. Important physical findings in supraventricular tachycardias are neck vein pulsations ("frog sign"); this sign is typical for the presence of AV nodal reentrant or circus movement tachycardias. In atrial fibrillation, irregular pulsations in the neck veins are present. The physical signs of AV dissociation (present in ~ 50% of all ventricular tachycardias) are irregular A waves in the jugular pulse, beat-to-beat changes in systolic blood pressure and varying intensity of the first heart sound. Typical ECG signs are visible during sinus rhythm in some patients at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and/or sudden death. The most common type is preexcitation (WPW syndrome) with the trias  - wave, short PR interval and ST segment depression. In the Brugada syndrome the ECG typically shows right bundle branch block with ST segment elevation in leads V1-V3. The predominant feature in the long QT syndrome is QT prolongation; the QT interval in these pts is >550ms, the QTc averages >>0.39s in males and >0.44s in females. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) dysplasia/ cardiomyopathy is characterized by peculiar RV involvement and electrical instability. Epsilon waves or localized prolongation (>110ms) of QRS in V1-V3 with/without inverted T waves in V2-V3 are typical ECG findings. Careful physical examination and correct interpretation of the ECG in the emergency situation leads to a better outcome for many of the patients. Correct treatment based on an understanding of the mechanism that caused the cardiac emergency may not only be lifesaving in the immediate situation but may also improve the quality of life.
