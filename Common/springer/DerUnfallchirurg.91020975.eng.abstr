By using UTN in the treatment of very distal tibia fractures delayed fracture-healing and pseudarthrosis with breakage of the nail are described. The removal of the distal solid part of the nail shows a special difficulty. We report about two cases of broken UTN in 1997. A simple extraction device to remove the distal part of the broken nail is demonstrated.
