 The results of a retrospective study concerning percutaneous catheter drainage of 62 intra-abdominal abscesses in 60 patients were demonstrated, including the procedure and complications. For the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control. We placed a pigtail or van Sonnenberg catheter by Seldinger or trocar technique into the abscesses. The primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was 85 %. Complications occurred in 6.4 % of the cases with a mortality of 0 %. This method is an acceptable alternative to surgery for many patients. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses, especially in the critically ill patient.
