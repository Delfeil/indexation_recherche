Abstract.  In the United States of America (1991), in Canada (1998), in the UK (1993, 1994) and in Germany (1999) recommendations have been published concerning performance of "exposure-prone procedures" (EPP) by persons infected with Hepatitis-B virus (HBV), Hepatitis-C virus (HCV) or HIV. This review summarises the definition of EPP, methods to reduce the transmission of blood-borne pathogens, immunisation and screening policies, constitution of an advisory panel and the question of trace-back investigations described in these regulations.
