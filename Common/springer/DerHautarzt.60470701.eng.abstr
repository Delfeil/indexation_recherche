A 35-year-old woman suffering from Crohn's disease for 3 years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the dorsa of her hands and feet, as well as on her elbows and wrists. The clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum. No improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids. In contrast, treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions. During a new attack of her Crohn's disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions flared again. The parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and Crohn's disease, as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases, strongly suggest a common etiology. This hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature.
