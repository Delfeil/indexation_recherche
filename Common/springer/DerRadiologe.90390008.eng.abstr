The demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher. In the region of the ankle joint, it is therefore ideal to use the arthroscope for pathology. Indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are: soft tissue impingement, ligament instability, impingement in the syndesmosis, osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, arthrosis, and loose os trigonum of the talus. In the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments, loose bodies, and synovitis with soft tissue impingement. A new indication is arthroscopically assisted arthrodesis of the talar and subtalar joint. The reported high incidence of complications, especially in terms of neurovascular lesions, can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non-invasive distraction of the joint.
