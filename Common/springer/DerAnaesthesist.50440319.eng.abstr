The physiological pattern of regional pulmonary blood flow is mainly determined by the relationship of pulmonary arterial, venous, and alveolar pressures [12, 32]. Changes in alveolar pressure and pulmonary geometry may therefore be expected to influence regional perfusion, which is a key determinant of pulmonary gas exchange. Unilateral thoracotomy is usually performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position. The present study examined the influence of mechanical factors on regional pulmonary blood flow distribution in rabbits in the lateral decubitus position during normoxia and unilateral hypoxia.
