Open reduction and rigid fixation with maxillomandibular fixation at least intraoperatively is the method of choice for treatment of mandibular fractures. We report an effective method of internal temporary fixation which significantly facilitates fracture reduction and stabilization. The technique is used in combination with special FAMI screws and a monocortical miniplates system according to Champy, which eliminates in most cases the need for maxillomandibular fixation. Our results in 78 patients with mandibular fractures confirmed the reliability and the efficiency of the internal temporary fixation.
