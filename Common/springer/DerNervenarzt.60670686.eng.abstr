Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (BT) induce a localized, long-lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the BT dose administered and that is free of major side effects. With this profile, BT can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle hyperactivities. These disorders occur frequently in patients in institutions for neurological rehabilitation. They are difficult to treat with conventional methods, can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system. In the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of BT in rehabilitative neurology. Regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome, five main indication groups are identified: (1) improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles; (2) relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles; (3) improvement of patient care; (4) avoidance of sequelae in joints, tendons, ligaments, and teeth; (5) various special indications.
