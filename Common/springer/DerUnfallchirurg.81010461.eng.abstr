50 patients following talar fractures type Marti 2, 3 and 4 during the years 1972-1993, could be analysed retrospectively. Evaluated factors effecting posttraumatic avascular necrosis of the body of the talus are: type of fracture, age of the patient, additional fracture of the medial malleolus and time of non weight bearing. The Hawkins sign is reliable to show vitality in the body of the talus. We could see vascular impairment in 51 % of all Marti 3 fractures and in 100 % of all Marti 4 fractures. Patients with a concomitant fracture of the inner malleolus showed positive influence on the blood supply of the talus. In this case the ligamentum deltoideum and the ramus deltoideus of the arteria tibialis posterior remained intact. In addition to this the prognosis was better in young patients. A long period of non weight bearing could not preserve vitality of the talus. Necrosis of the talus did only appear in 34 % of the Marti 3 and in 51 % of the Marti 4 fractures. This means that early anatomic reconstruction of the talus is necessary. Primary arthrodesis of the ankle joint and talectomie are not up to date.
