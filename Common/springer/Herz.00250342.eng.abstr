For clinical evaluation and decision-making in patients with valvular heart disease, the diagnostic armamentarium expands steadily. This evolution makes it difficult to choose the most appropriate approach for a specific valvular lesion. It may also reflect our uncertainty of what are the findings that best predict clinical outcome of patients, e. g. after surgery. Accordingly, for each type of valvular lesion, some pathopysiological considerations are stated in order to derive the most important measures that would allow optimal guidance of patients. Based on the considerations the value of an MR study is discussed for each valvular lesion.
