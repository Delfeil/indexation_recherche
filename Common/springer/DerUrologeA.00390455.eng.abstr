One hundred and twenty-five consecutive patients with prostate cancer underwent an extended, radical perineal prostatectomy according to the technique described by VE Weldon. This technique was modified by an initial complete mobilization of the posterior aspect of the prostate and seminal vesicles from the rectum and pelvic wall, incision of the endopelvic fascia, and partial resection of the dorsal vein complex after suture ligature. The perioperative morbidity was low.
