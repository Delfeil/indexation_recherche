By means of a visual tristimulus colorimeter according to Guild-Bechstein, the following items were determined for a male deuteranopic observer on a foveal, i. e. 2 ° diameter visual field: (1) the deuteranopic missing color, by means of the perceptual criterion "indistinguishably equal", (2) the neutral zone, by means of the perceptual criterion "neither blue nor yellow," (3) the alychne trace, by means of the perceptual criterion "heterochromatically equally bright." The evaluation in the chromaticity chart resulted in two straight lines forming a dichromatic pencil, the deuteranopic missing color providing the carrier point (vertex). These two straight lines represent the referential chromaticities of a deuteranopic opponent color system.
