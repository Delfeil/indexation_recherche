Free muscle transplantation with motor innervation offers the posibility to add contractile elements to upper extremities with extensive loss of musculature due to direct trauma or untreated compartment syndrome (Volkmann's contracture). The functional cross section area and the mean resting fiber length determine the maximum power and the contracting amplitude of the donor muscle. Although considerably weaker than the finger flexors to be replaced, the gracilis muscle was the preferred donor muscle because of its neurovascular pedicle and the minimal donor site morbidity. In a series of 15 gracilis transplantations, all 13 muscles that survived regained function. Finger motion was dependent on the preoperative condition of tendons and joints. Even after complete loss of the flexor and extensor compartment a useful upper extremity could be restored, which was preferable to the only alternative - amputation.
