Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients, especially in AIDS cases. The present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign-body reaction in a patient with successfully treated PCP who was known to have AIDS. This form of residues of completely healed PCP tends to be rare. Other infectious granulomas, foreign-body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed. After cautious decalcification, pneumocysts can be demonstrated with methamine silver (Grocott). It is important to be aware that PCP can also undergo spontaneous cure, so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of AIDS.
