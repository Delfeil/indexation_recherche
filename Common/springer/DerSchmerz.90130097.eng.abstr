Complementary medicine is not a therapy without side effects. Undergoing acupuncture can result in hazardous complications. Therefore patients should be advised of adverse events associated with acupuncture. A consent form for acupuncture is presented. Only physicians with good anatomical and clinical skills should use acupuncture.
