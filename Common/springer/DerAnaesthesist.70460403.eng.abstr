The mucociliary escalator of the lung is an important protective transport system by means of which inhaled particles and microorganisms are removed from the tracheobronchial system. In general, it is assumed that anaesthetics inhibit mucociliary clearance [3, 5, 6, 19, 27]. In the present prospective study the effect of combination anaesthesia with isoflurane, fentanyl, vecuronium, and nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture on bronchial mucus transport velocity (BTV) was investigated.
