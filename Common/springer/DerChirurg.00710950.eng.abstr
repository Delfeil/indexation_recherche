Abstract.  Purpose: Evaluation of quality of life data and patient satisfaction to estimate the outcome of laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) is nowadays an important issue, the long-term outcome of this has not yet received much attention. Methods: In the present study we evaluated the outcome of quality of life data of 70 patients who underwent "floppy" Nissen fundoplication at our institute 3 years after surgery. Quality of life was evaluated with the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI). Additionally the subjectivity and objectivity of the quality of the procedure and possible side effects were evaluated with a questionnaire. Results: Three years after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, patients gave their quality of life (GIQLI) in an overall score of 123.9 points. This is comparable to 122.6 points in the normal population. There was no difference detectable in the subdimensions of GIQLI. Ninety-eight percent of the patients estimated their satisfaction with the procedure as excellent or good and would undergo surgery again if necessary. Four patients suffered from minimal side effects from the procedure, but had no decrease in their quality of life. None of the patients needed antireflux medications postoperatively. Laparoscopic redo-fundoplication was performed in two patients 3 months after initial surgery because of persisting dysphagia. Conclusion: The efficacy and long-term outcome of treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with laparoscopic "floppy" Nissen fundoplication can be evaluated by objective testing, but also by subjective judgment of the patient and with an evaluation of quality of life.
