The requirement of blood transfusions was evaluated in a two compartment (retrospective/prospective) study in our renal transplantation program. Between July 1st, 1993 and December 31st, 1994 (observation period I) we retrospectively investigated 110 patients with end stage renal disease and anemia undergoing kidney transplantation. Between January 1st, 1995 and December 31st, 1996 (observation period II) the requirement of blood transfusions was followed prospectively in 134 patients after allogenic renal transplantation. The amount of blood drawn for preoperative diagnostic investigations was in observation period I significantly higher (280 ml) than in observation period II (150 ml) (p = 0.02). For postoperative diagnostic tests in observation period II significantly less blood (240 ml) was needed than in observation period I (510 ml) (p = 0.01). The intraoperative bloodloss was similar in both periods (170 ml vs. 190 ml; p = 0.6). The need for closer graft observation was the reason for significantly increased amount of blood transfusions in patients with delayed graft function. The number of blood transfusions was significant lower in patients with primary graft function (p = 0.0001). There was no correlation between blood transfusions and the use of ATG/OKT3, surgical complications and reoperations. With an improved management of blood drawing for diagnostic tests after allogenic kidney transplantation the number of perioperative blood transfusions can be reduced significantly.
