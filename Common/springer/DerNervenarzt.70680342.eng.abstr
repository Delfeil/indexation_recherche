Legionella is a frequent etiologic agent in the development of both nosocomial and community acquired pneumonias. Involvement of the nervous system is common in Legionella infections. We present a case of Legionnaires' disease which illustrates distinctive neurologic findings including delirium and cerebellar dysfunction. Furthermore, this paper reviews the neurological and psychiatric features of 609 Legionella infected patients with involvement of the nervous system. The most common signs were disorientation (58%), headache (52.4%), and somnolence (39.7%). Less frequent or rare were: cerebellar dysfunction (11.2%), hallucinations (8.4%), agitation or stupor (4.1%), affective disorders (3.1%), peripheral neuropathy (2.8%), pyramidal disturbances (2.1%), memory loss (1.6%), seizures (1.5%), cranial nerve palsies (1.5%), incontinence (0.7%), and extrapyramidal disturbances (0.3%). Cranial CT scans, cerebrospinal fluid findings, and nerve and muscle biopsies were usually unremarkable. Neuropathologic examinations failed to demonstrate specific characteristics. Hyponatremia and serum CPK level elevation were present in up to 89% and 50% of patients, respectively. Prognosis of disturbances of the nervous system was mainly good. We conclude that in the presence of definite neurological findings, pulmonary infection, hyponatremia, and CPK elevation Legionella infection should be considered.
