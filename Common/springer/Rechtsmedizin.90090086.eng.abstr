 A population study of HUMF13B locus in a population sample of 426 unrelated individuals was carried out to investigate the allele distribution in north Poland. HUMF13B alleles were identified using a precisely optimised PCR method. Amplification products were separated on horizontal non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by silver staining. The most frequent alleles were 10 (42,6%), 9 (23,9%) and 8 (21,4%) and one rare variant (allele 12) was observed with a frequency of 0,23%. Relatively high indices of discrimination power (0.866), polymorphic information content (0.661) and heterozygosity (0.704) confirm the usefulness of HUMF13B locus for forensic identification purposes.
