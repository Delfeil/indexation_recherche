 Electrical atrial remodeling during rapid atrial activation is known to be an important phenomenon for perpetuation of atrial fibrillation. Recent studies have demonstrated that electrical remodeling is mediated by an increase in calium currents through L-type calcium channels during atrial fibrillation. Electromechanical factors may also contribute to the observed shortening in the effective refractory period (ERP) during atrial remodeling. The purpose of our study was to examine the influence of right atrial pressure on electrical remodeling during high frequency pacing in an intact animal model.  10 closed-chest dogs (25+/-1kg) were studied during continuous autonomic blockade with i.v. Atropine (bolus: 0.04mg/kg followed by 0.007mg/kg/h) and i.v. Propranolol (bolus: 0.2mg/kg followed by 0.04mg/kg/h). The right atrial appendage was paced for 7 hours at a rate of 800bpm (4mA). Right atrial pressure and systemic blood pressure were continuously recorded. Atrial ERP was determined at a different right atrial site every hour at a basic cycle length of 350ms. After 7h pacing, animals were divided into two groups according to the mean right atrial pressure (group 1: 4+/-0.2mmHg versus group 2: 7+/-1mmHg; p<0.01).  Despite autonomic blockade, significant electrical remodeling was observed in all animals. The decrement in ERP was significantly greater in group 2compared to group1 (group1: 166+/-12ms to 145+/-16ms versus group2: 164+/-14ms to 126+/-17ms; p<0.05). The duration of induced atrial fibrillation was significantly longer in group 2 compared to group1 (59+/-22s vs. 19+/-12s; p<0.05). The mean AF cycle length was not significantly different in both groups (135+/-27ms vs. 142+/-24ms; p=ns). While ERP reached baseline 30 minutes after cessation of rapid pacing in group 1 the ERP remained shorter in group2 (91+/-8%; p=0.054). There were no differences in blood pressure, mean atrial or ventricular rates between the two groups.  Atrial remodeling is accentuated by elevated right atrial pressure despite complete autonomic blockade. Thus, increases mechanical stretch produced by elevated atrial pressure may be an additional factor which contributes to electrical remodeling during atrial fibrillation.
