We were interested in the efficacy and morbidity of the ureteroscopy (URS) in the treatment of "steinstrasse" after ESWL. From 1991 to 1996, 27 patients with "steinstrasse" were treated with a total of 32 ureteroscopic procedures. The URS alone had a stonefree success rate of 43.7 % (n = 14). URS combined with ESWL was effective in 43.7 % (n = 14), leading to an overall success rate of 87.4 %. In 4 cases (12.6 %) a second therapy was necessary (in 3 cases a second URS + ESWL and in one patient a nephrectomy due to septic pyonephrosis). The overall rate of auxiliary ESWL after URS was 53.1 %. Mean operating time was 72 minutes (20-180 min). The rate of complications was 21.8 % (n = 7) and mainly due to ureteral perforations or postoperative fever but none suffered from late complications like ureteral stricture. All treated patients received a double-J-stent and antibiotics. The treatment of "steinstrasse" in the middle portion of the ureter proved to be more difficult due to the anatomical position of the ureter and lasted in a longer operating time as the upper or distal "steinstrasse". The stone extraction and the lithoclast-lithotripsy alone or in combination were the most frequent used ureteroscopic procedures to eliminate stone fragments. The URS alone or in combination with the ESWL for the treatment of "steinstrasse" is a highly effective and safe approach.
