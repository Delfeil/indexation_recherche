Abstract.  The most common causes for small-bowel obstructions with subsequent strangulation are intra-abdominal adhesions and external hernias. We report an unusual case of strangulated small-bowel hernia through a congenital window in the falciform ligament. The diagnosis and surgical treatment are discussed.
