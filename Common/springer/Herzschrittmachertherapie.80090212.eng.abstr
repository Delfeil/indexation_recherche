 The description of heart rate variability (HRV) by statistical and spectral parameters is a problem not yet satisfactorally solved. Methods of the fractal geometry might provide some advantages because not only the length of RR-intervals (RRI) but the information derived from the order of RRI is considered. This method is expected to allow differentiation between chance and deterministic chaotic behavior. Hence, we developed techniques for the description of HRV by means of dimension analysis.  The course of information dimension (ID) over 24h in 20 healthy probands was estimated from a digital holter monitor recording (sampling rate 1000Hz, holter recorder FD3 Oxford Instruments). For that we calculated ID from a time window of 2500 RRI for the embedding dimension 2 up to 6. The analysis window was subsequently moved forward along a time axis in steps of 1000 RRI.  The graphical reproduction of ID courses over 24h showed irregularly alternating phases of chance and deterministic chaotic behavior during the day. Conversely during the night two different patterns were demonstrated: either a persistant phase of increased chance or a period of deterministic chaotic behavior predominated. A significant correlation neither with heart rate nor with other collected or calculated data could be shown.  Our method is able to asses ID over time as well as with increasing embedding dimensions. So beside statistical and spectral parameters there is a further new tool for HRV description available. Following studies have to elucidate clinical aspects.
