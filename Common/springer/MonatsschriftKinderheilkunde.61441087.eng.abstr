 Objective: Incidence, symptoms, diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of cardiac myxomas in childhood and adolescence.  Methods: Literature research, case reports of three patients 61/12 to 167/12 years old.  Results: Cardiac myxomas are very rare benign neoplasias of which 75 % arise in the left atrium. There are general symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, anaemia, and accelerated blood sedimentation rate, symptoms of mechanical obstruction (pulmonary oedema, reduction of cardiac output, pre-syncope and syncope), and the sequelae of tumour embolisation. Heart murmurs are frequent. Echocardiography is the best method for finding the diagnosis. Immediate surgical extirpation of the myxoma is the therapy of choice to anticipate dangerous embolism or syncope. The reported overall mortality rate ranges from 0 % to 5.5 %, for children the risk seems to be lower.  Conclusion: In patients with general symptoms, heart murmurs, circulatory or neurological symptoms a cardiac myxoma should be taken into account. Echocardiography is the best method to confirm or to reject this diagnosis.
