A 50 year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical infraclavicular blockade of the plexus brachialis (VIP). Postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia, which resolved completely after treatment. The blockade of the plexus was performed correctly, failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded. Therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the VIP, which might occur despite correct technique, and requires that the patient be informed of this eventuality. Nevertheless, the VIP is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet. The risk of a pneumothorax is about 0.2 to 0.7%.
