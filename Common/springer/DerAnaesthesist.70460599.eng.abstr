Reproduction of an ancient Egyptian mouth-opening device raises certain technological and historical questions. The most effective variation has proven to be a device made of strip iron built exactly according to the proportions given in the Hunefer papyrus. This device allows quick and safe intubation of intubation dummy CLA 8 without a supplementary light source. Originally, the device was a metal instrument made of meteoric iron, apparently produced only in small numbers. To date, the form of production remains a mystery, since the smelting and processing of iron was totally uncommon in ancient Egypt. Based on the material structure of the device and certain portrayals in graves in Deir el-Medina, mouth-opening as it was actually performed reveals a methodology that can be reconciled with modern pre-clinical polytrauma management. In principle, this indicates that the introduction of artificial respiration thousands of years ago would have been possible.
