The volume of preoperative screening investigations for outpatient anaesthesia ranges from few, selectively ordered investigations to extensive routine diagnostic procedures. It seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs. The purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient. As shown by a number of studies, preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance. Abnormal laboratory results in otherwise healthy patients rarely alter the anaesthetic management of the patient and are not related to perioperative complications. Extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care budgets. A more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable savings. To achieve costeffective evalulation an efficient organisation of properative assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on-day-of-surgery-cancellations. There is no medicolegal obligation to perform routine diagnostic testing. The anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary. According to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease. Careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated.
