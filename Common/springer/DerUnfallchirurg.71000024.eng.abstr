Patello-tibial transfixation using the MPT-fixator is a new kind of external fixation. The device works biomechanically transferring the quadriceps tension forces from the patella to the lower leg and converting them into extension of the knee. The fixator can be applied in two different configurations. When performing configuration A, a Steinmann pin with a central thread is transversely placed through the patella and proximal tibia. Both pins are joined to connecting rods. Configuration B differs from type A in that a Schanz screw is inserted from anterior to posterior through the proximal tibia. The frame construction is a-cheived by fastening the tibial-sided Steinmann pin with a special clamp at the Schanz screw. Patello-tibial transfixation is indicated in the repair of fresh extensor mechanism disruption and reconstruction of neglected rupture of the patellar tendon. The technique provides a secure protection of the repair and reconstruction against mechanical overloading during the healing period. It enables immediate functional aftertreatment and mobilization with early full weight bearing.
