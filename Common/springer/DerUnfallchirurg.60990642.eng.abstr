Early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function ("gut injury hypothesis") and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or postinjury patients. Nineteen severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score 40.3+/-11.6) were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube. Despite maxillary fractures, rhinoliquorrhea and blunt abdominal trauma the enteral feeding was mostly started immediately after trauma. Intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within 1 or 2 days. Total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases; a central venous line was always additionally necessary. However, the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut. The study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients. The expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified. Enterally fed patients may have a better outcome that those in whom only parenteral is employed.
