500 melanocytic lesions were examined by dermatoscopy using the ABCD rule prior to excision and histologic diagnosis. Regular nevi (n=272) exhibited a score of 3.55+/-0.87, nevi with histologic signs of dysplasia (n=190) a score of 4.0+/-0.68 and melanomas (n=30) a score of 5.08+/-1.24. This study suggests that the ABCD rule of dermatoscopy greatly facilitates the evaluation of melanocytic lesions. When the dermatoscopic score is higher than 4.2, melanoma should be considered.
