Abstract.  We report on a 76-year-old female patient with clinical findings consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema. Plasma glucagon levels were slightly elevated, but advanced radiologic techniques revealed no evidence of an underlying pancreatic tumour. The dermatosis responded excellently to oral therapy with dapsone. The possible aetiology and pathogenesis of the "pseudoglucagonoma syndrome" are discussed.
