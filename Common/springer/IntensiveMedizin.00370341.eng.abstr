 Altered mechanical properties of the chest wall may influence different aspects of respiratory function, such as ventilation, work of breathing, respiratory muscles, and gas exchange. Up to now, different methods have been used to study the static and dynamical properties of the chest wall, including the rapid airway occlusion and the forced oscillation technique, but the role of the chest wall during passive and active ventilation has not been widely investigated due to the difficulties of compartmental analysis.
