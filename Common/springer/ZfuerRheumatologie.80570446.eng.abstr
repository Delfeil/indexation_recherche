 Only during recent years have intensive attempts been made to install a program for more objectively based quality criteria instead of the traditional subjectively and empirically determined therapeutic decisions for the application of DMARDs. The optimized quality management for this treatment should focus on factors such as: diagnosis as early as possible (basic for the introduction of DMARD therapy), reliable assessment of the individual long-term prognosis (as an important aid in the choice of the appropriate drug), prompt determination and establishment of the chosen therapy, and an optimal long-term application of this treatment (including competent control of effectiveness, tolerance, and compliance). Instrumentation for these purposes have been so far only partly available, e.g., diagnostic criteria and control guidelines. Besides the partially missing appropriate measures, maximum quality management is presently opposed by  insufficient rheumatological specialist care for many RA patients - caused by the lack of specialists and a dilatory attitude towards involving them, respectively. Nevertheless, there is hope that in the course of new developments the gap between needs and benefits of quality management will grow smaller.
