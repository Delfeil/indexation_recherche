Purpose: Although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago, the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear. Recent OCT studies have shown schisislike spaces in connection with the disc. None of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven. Besides the hypothesis of exudation, the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion. We describe a case of macular detachment associated with optic pit that regained full vision after pars plana vitrectomy with laser coagulation and gas tamponade over a follow-up of 26 months. The purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits.
