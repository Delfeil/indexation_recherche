Clinical observations consistently show that persons physically or sexually abused in infancy tend to become revictimized in subsequent relationships and, further, that these abusive relationships show a high degree of stability. One major finding of attachment research is the high occurrence of insecure attachment to primary attachment figures in abused persons. Among the typical patterns of relationship, role reversal (parentification) has been emphasized. From the psychoanalytic point of view, the theory of introjection of abusive relationships along with the newer theories on masochism have been making invaluable contributions to an understanding of the attachment behavior of abused persons. Finally, some consequences for the treatment of traumatized persons are discussed.
