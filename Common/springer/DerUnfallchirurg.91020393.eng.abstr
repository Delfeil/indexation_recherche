The posterior luxation of the shoulder joint is a rarely reported and often not recognized lesion in the clinical workday. The authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation. In that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint. Finally they draw the readers attention to operative steps to prevent a reluxation of the shoulder joint.
