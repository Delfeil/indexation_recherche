 Introduction The TALENT system has made it feasible for the first time to use endovascular stent placement in the treatment of infrarenal aneurysms of the abdominal aorta with neck diameters greater than 26 mm. The following paper presents the experience of 29 German vascular surgical centers using the TALENT system. Materials and Methods Between October 1996 and September 1997, a total of 123 aortic aneurysms in 122 patients were treated endovascularly. Ninety-five infrarenal aneurysms of the abdominal aorta were treated using bifurcated stents, while in 28 cases tube stents were implanted. In nine cases, tube stents were used to treat aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. A total of 111 patients (112 aneurysms) presented for follow-up. The average proximal diameter of the bifurcated stents in infrarenal aneurysms was 30 mm (range 24-36 mm), while the average iliac stent diameter was 14 mm (range: 10-20 mm). In tube stents, diameters ranged from 24-30 mm in abdominal stents and from 32-40 mm in thoracic stents, respectively. In this series, each stent was individually manufactured for the patient on the basis of findings from computed tomography (CT) and calibrated angiography. Results Endovascular treatment of aneurysms was successful technically in 96% of patients. During a follow-up period averaging 4.3 months, the following complications were observed: 5 perioperative death (4.1%), 4 conversions to open surgical therapy (3.3%), 7 endoleaks (5.7%), 2 stent dislocations, 2 iliac stent thromboses, 2 perforations of iliac arteries, 1 inguinal hematoma, and 1 inguinal infection. Conclusions These preliminary findings show that aneurysms with larger neck diameters are amenable to endovascular treatment. Despite the wide distribution of participating vascular surgery centers with varying degrees of experience and many first-time implantations, the results of the present multicenter study hardly differed from those reported in larger series in established institutions. Through the use of larger-diameter stents, up to 50% of all infrarenal aneurysms of the abdominal aorta may be possibly successfully treated using endovascular methods.
