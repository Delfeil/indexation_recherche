Dysmorphophobia shall be described as an example for a communicative disorder and be deliminated from other syndromes under which it has been subsumed so far. On the background of available literature, the "fear of deformity" is to be elaborated as feeling ashamed of the contemptuous look of another person, whose look has turned into the own view. This results in a discrepancy with the ego and the own self conveyed by others, finally leading to depersonalisation. This basic interpersonal appearance shall be further illustrated by two individual examples.
