Purpose: Purpose of this study was to test a triple slice saturation recovery turbo FLASH sequence for myocardial perfusion imaging. In addition data-evaluation-tools for qualitative and quantitative perfusion parameters are presented and preliminary tested. Material and Methods: We examined 8 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with myocardial infarction. Parameters of the saturation recovery turbo FLASH sequence were as follows: TR = 2.5 msec, TE = 1.2 msec,  = 8  °, 3 slices, thickness 10 mm. For data analysis signal-intensity time curves were calculated pixel by pixel and evaluated for signal-intensity-increase over baseline and signal-intensity-upslope. Images were displayed color-coded. For quantitative data analysis we used the indicator dilution theory and developed a deconvolution algorithm which takes the arterial input function into account to calculate the myocardial mean transit time (MTT). Results: The color-coded parametermaps showed uniform conditions in normal myocardium of volunteers, but reduced signal-intensity-increase over baseline and signal-intensity-upslope for infarcted areas in patients. The MTTs calculated using our algorithm were significantly shorter than those assessed with previous methods and matched better with values derived from literature. Infarcted areas show prolonged MTTs in comparison to normal myocardium. Conclusion: A triple slice saturation recovery turbo FLASH sequence is suitable for myocardial perfusion imaging. Color-coded parametermaps can visualize hypoperfused areas. For calculating myocardial MTTs using indicator dilution therapy a deconvolution algorithm is necessary.
