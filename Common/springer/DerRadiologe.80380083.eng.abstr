Therapeutic choice in laryngeal carcinoma is influenced by the nature of the tumor and a variety of factors involving the patient and physician. Small (T1) and exophytic (T1, T2) tumors are suitable for radiotherapy. Limited lesions (T1, T2) can be cured by functional endoscopic resection techniques or external partial laryngectomies. Extensive tumors (large T2; T3) are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation, especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy. When radiation treatment fails, surgery succeeds in more than half of the cases. Tumors infiltrating or transgressing the laryngeal framework (T4) can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy. Subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts. Lymphatics are preferentially treated with the same modality as used in the primary disease. Inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases, with the exception of early glottic cancer.
