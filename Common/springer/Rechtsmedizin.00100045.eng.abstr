The dramatically progressing changes in age distribution confront our discipline with new issues. The main forensic problems result from geriatric nursing (1.7 million), in particular neglect and violence are involved. Nursing maltreatment is at the fore front. Competition intensifies due to the permanently increasing numbers of ambulant nursing services (1998: 11 730), especially since quality controls only take place on special occasions (e.g. filing of complaint). Thus, nursing maltreatment frequently remains undiscovered or is only detected after a postmortem examination. Annually, approximately 16 000 (!) people over the age of 60 become victims of criminal violence in the Federal Republic of Germany. Knowledge from other fields of forensic traumatology (e.g. traffic medicine) gains special importance in connection with the injuries sustained. The danger of a limitation of therapy increases in injured elderly people and in diseases mainly due to financial reasons. The reasons for propagating active euthanasia, partially arising from the social sector, are discussed. Here, long-term therapy with e.g. psychoactive drugs also lead to further problems. Legal medicine as an "early warning system" and co-ordinator of all prevention possibilities plays a central role in the recognition of new dangers for old people.
