Objective. In the German physician-based emergency medical system (EMS) psychiatric emergency situations (PES) rank on third place contradictory to it's importance during emergency physician training program. The aim of our study was to examine the relevance of PES and the stress which PES imposes upon EMS physicians. Further, the interest of training programs on that issue was determined. Knowledge about PES was investigated by a short test. Methods: 952 emergency physicians were sent a questionnaire about following: demographic data, frequency of PES, strain by PES, own knowledge, interest about training programs. Further five typical PES were presented for diagnostic and therapeutic judgement. Results: 222 responded (183 men/37 women/2 without gender data, average age: 40.1 +/- 6.7, qualification as emergency physician: 9.6 +/- 5.1 years, most frequent subspeciality in-hospital physicians: anaesthesiology 67.5%, in-practice physicians: general medicine 72.1%). PES frequence was estimated at 9.4%, personal knowledge judged only by 13% as sufficient, 14.2 felt incapable by PES. 73% saw importance of training, especially expressed by the more experienced (P<0.05). Test presented 65% correct diagnoses, 33% correct therapy, 26% incorrect decision of hospital admission. Conclusion: PES are a frequent problem of pre-hospital patient care for emergency physicians. As personal knowledge was estimated to be insufficient, the interest for courses concerning PES issues is high.
