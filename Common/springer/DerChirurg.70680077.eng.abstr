 The aim of our study was to observe the incorporation and induced immune response of sterilized bone allografts. We performed an orthotopical tibial segment transplantation using two different inbred rat strains. We compared irradiated (25 kGy), autoclaved (134  °C) and cryopreserved (-80  °C) bone grafts. The observation took place 6 and 12 weeks post-operativelely. Results: The incorporation of irradiated grafts took longer than cryopreserved transplants. Autoclaved grafts were not incorporated and only bridged by new callus formation. A cell-mediated immune response against the cryopreserved grafts could be demonstrated. Irradiated grafts induced a minor immune response; autoclaved grafts did not. Conclusion: There seems to be a correlation between loss of antigenicity and failure of graft incorporation. Therefore, it seems probable, that some bone antigenicity is necessary for the induction of cellular mechanisms during graft incorporation.
