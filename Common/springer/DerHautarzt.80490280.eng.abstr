The development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in housewives. In 1986 we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife. Now, we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the household and grade them in comparison to the data of 1986. The results are based on the analysis of a large population of 2633 patients with the occupation "housewife" and the diagnosis "eczema" who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK).
