Clinical course. We present a potentially fatal case of acute methaqualone (M) poisoning with very low serum concentrations of M but extremly high levels of its metabolite, 2-methyl-3-(2-hydroxymethyl-phenyl)-4 (3H)-chinazoline (Met-1). A 23-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit 2 days after ingestion of 4-5 g M in an suicidal attempt. On admission he was somnolent and poorly responsive to painful stimuli. Physical examination revealed a heart rate of 95 bpm, a blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg, and a normal body temperature. His chest was clear to auscultation, respirations were shallow, and the skin was cyanotic. The electrocardiogram was unremarkable. The chest radiograph showed a normal heart size without pulmonary infiltrates or venous congestion. The pupils were dilated but reactive to light. The neurologic examination was further remarkable for increased limb reflexes, myoclonia, and positive pyramidal signs. During the next 2 days the patient became comatose and developed respiratory insufficiency due to non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, which was confirmed by chest radiograph and haemodynamic investigations by means of right heart catheterisation. He required mechanical ventilation for 6 days. Finally, he recovered completely and was discharged in good condition.
