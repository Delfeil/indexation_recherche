The incidence of giant cell tumors accounts for less than 5 % of all bone tumors. In the thoracic spine these tumors are extremely rare (1-1.5 % of the giant-cell tumors). The potential malignant character of giant cell tumors of the spine usually leads to wide surgical extirpation by ventral approach. The filling of bone defects with palacos cement after tumor resection is sufficient in the metaphysis of long bones. The case presented here is a giant cell tumor of the upper thoracic spine with primarily posterior destruction of the vertebral body and left arch. A single dorsal approach allowed for intralesional resection and filling of the defect with bone cement. This procedure was sufficient to achieve a solid fixation without recurrence of the giant cell tumor.
