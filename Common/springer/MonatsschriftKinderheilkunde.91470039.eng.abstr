In a male newborn a continuous systolic-diastolic murmur on the left sternal border was caused by a large coronary artery fistula from the left coronary artery to the right ventricle. Repeated echocardiographic evaluation revealed normal ventricular function and a slight increase in fistula diameter from 3,5 mm in the newborn period to 5 mm at the age of 18 months. Interventional catheterization was carried out electively. Complete occlusion of the fistulas was achieved using a flexible coil delievered with a 4 french catheter without any complication. Echocardiographic follow-up confirmed the postinterventional angiographic finding of complete occlusion of the fistula and documented normal ventricular function.
