 Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in patients 80 years of age and older (82.3  +/-  2.0 years) was performed in 51 patients over a period of 10 years from 1985 to 1995; 34 of these patients underwent elective aneurysm repair and 17 emergency operations for rupture. Of these 51 patients, 50 cases were reviewed for long-term survival, and 44 case reports were reviewed for preoperative risk factors, postoperative complications, discharge to nursing homes and duration of hospitalisation. After 30 days, the mortality for asymptomatic or symptomatic intact aneurysm repair was 5.9%; in the case of emergency repair for rupture the mortality was 64.7%. After elective operations 9.4% of the patients were discharged to nursing homes. All patients who survived emergency operations went on to live normal lives in their previous housing areas. The survival probability was 81% for 1 year, 56% for 3 years, and 42% for 5 years. After surviving the emergency operation, life expectancy was similar to the group of elective aneurysm repair. The analysis did not show any risk factors with predictive value for long-term survival after elective surgery. The results justify elective abdominal aneurysm repair in octogenarians. Even in the case of aneurysm rupture every patient should be operated on. The mortality in elective surgery did not differ very much from that of other patients younger than 80 years old, and life expectancy after surgery was similar to the general population of 80 years of age and older.
