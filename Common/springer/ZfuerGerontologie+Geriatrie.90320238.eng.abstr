  In a community sample of 165 elderly aged 61 to 96 years (mean 69.65 years) from East and West Germany, present diseases, subjective health, impairments, health-related control-beliefs, social support (F-SOZU; Sommer & Fydrich, 1989), and health related coping-styles ("Bern Coping Styles Questionnaire" BEFO; Heim et al., 1991) were assessed. By means of a stepwise multiple regression analysis, the differential impact of control beliefs, subjective morbidity, subjective health, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables (age, sex, educational level) was analyzed. Elderly with little health related impairments, emotional support, and a relatively high educational level tried to cope with diseases by lowering the affective burden by cognitive and behavioral strategies. A growing number of diseases, a high level of practical help by others, but also a high degree of social burden were the best predictors for a health related coping strategy that is characterized by avoiding the preoccupation with the disease and by searching for emotional support. A health related coping style that is characterized by lamentation, brooding, and resignation was predicted best by poor subjective health, a high degree of social burden, and a low educational level.
