 Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery is technically difficult and demanding owing to its retroperitoneal location and its complex anatomic relationships. Performing these operations requires familiarity with the anatomy of the retroperitoneum and advanced laparoscopic skills. Intracorporeal suturing skills are also mandatory. Due to the small number of operations performed in centers, an evaluation period of at least 5 years is necessary to determine the role of laparoscopic procedures in pancreatic disease processes. However, laparoscopic procedures are beginning to represent an undeniable part of the surgical repertoire against pancreatic pathology.
