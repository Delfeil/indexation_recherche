Problem: The major problem when reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) with the semitendinous tendon (STT) is the low primary stability of the STT graft fixation techniques. Methods: From 1994 to 1996, a surgical procedure for arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL with the paired STT was performed on ten cadaveric knees, followed by operations on 26 patients (average age, 25.1 years; range, 16-43 years). The femoral attachment was achieved using a U-shaped tendon wrapped around a bone plug, which was then blocked in a steplike femoral channel. The tibial attachment was attained using a boneplug and applying a 7-mm interference screw. Results of the experimental trial: Anatomic studies were performed on the STT of the cadaveric knees. We carried out clinical tests (anterior drawer sign, Lachmann) and KT-1000 measurements preoperatively following artifical ACL rupture, and postoperatively. Isometrical estimations were performed for precise anatomical placement of the tendon and on the implaned STT transplant. The primary stability of the attachment methods in the tear-out testing amounted to 448.2 N for the femoral attachment and 440,0 N for the tibial attachment. Results of the clinical trial: The average postoperative surveillance period was 22.5 months (4-40) (range, 4-40 months). Evaluation was undertaken using the Insall knee score (average score preoperatively, 38.1; postoperatively, 95.7), the Insall functional score (average score preoperatively, 64.3; postoperatively, 96.2), and the Lysholm score (average score preoperatively, 53.6; postoperatively, 96.2). The IKDC score showed very good results in 26.9%, good results in 65.4%, and moderate results in 7.7% of cases. The KT-1000 measurement carried out postoperatively showed equivalent stability of both knee joints in 92.3% of all patients (anteroposterior transposition, < 2 mm at 89 N). A total of 80.8% of all patients, including four athletes, regained their normal level of activity. Conclusion: The presented method makes it possible to achieve an economical and easy STT attachment using entirely autologous material with a high level of primary stability.
