This paper starts by describing the setting of in-patient psychotherapy at the Cassel Hospital. Apart from individual psychanalytic psychotherapy, patients are treated with a particular form of intensive nursing work, called "psychosocial nursing", which is carried out within the setting of a therapeutic community. This external framework is contrasted with the "hospital in the mind" of the  patient which reflects the often split and fragmented internal world of the patient. The internal objects of the patients are projected into various people and parts of the hospital. Intensive work in the team and particularly work in the countertransference is necessary to integrate the spread-out transferences and enable the patient to integrate the splits within himself. The way the projections are enacted within the hospital and the work of integration within the team are described and illustrated with some case material.
