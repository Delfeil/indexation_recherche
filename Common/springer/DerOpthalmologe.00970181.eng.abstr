Background: The erbium:YAG laser has the potential of being used routinely for vitrectomy because of the excellent quality of liquefying vitreous structures and the low vacuum forces required. However, the use of silicone oil and perfluorocarbon may lead to unwanted temperature increases in the microsurgery probe. The aim of this work was to investigate this side effect.
