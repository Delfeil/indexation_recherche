The load limit of a tendon is expressed by the not linear force/lenghtening behavior. It is determined by the interrelation between load and load-bearing capacity. The load of a tendon results from exogenous, endogenous and temporal factors. The property factors and the aging influence the load-bearing capacity of a tendon. Partial ruptures show necrosis, calcification and fiber swelling. The attachment area shows a mineralization of the cartilage zone, a loss of the collagen fibrils and calcifications. The tendon ruptur knows extrinsic and intrinsic causes. Primary are micro and macrovascular tendon alterations, usually favour the rupture of tendons.
