A retrospective study over 5 years evaluated the medical records of 78 patients who had suffered lateral skull base fractures. The purpose of the present study was to answer the question of whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of meningitis. Fifty-five of 78 patients (71%) were given no antibiotics, among whom four developed meningitis. In 29% of patients treated with antibiotics, two developed meningitis. This difference was not significant. Even when cases with uncomplicated ("simple") lateral skull base fractures were separated from those with severe additional lesions related to their injuries, no significant correlation was found in the occurrence of meningitis despite the use of an antibiotic. Eight of 14 patients with initial otoliquorrheas were treated with antibiotics, with two of these 8 patients developing meningitis. None of the patients who did not receive antibiotics developed meningitis. Our findings show that it is not advisible to treat patients who have suffered from lateral skull base fractures with prophylactic antibiotics. Instead, these patients should be examined frequently and appropriate antibiotic therapy prescribed at the first clinical symptoms of meningitis.
