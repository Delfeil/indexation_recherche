Arthrodesis of the wrist joint is indicated in degenerative joint desease, instability and restricted and painful range of motion. Further indications are: failed reconstruction, partial arthrodesis or arthroplasty/total joint replacement. The surgical technique depends mainly on the quality of bone substance and degree of joint degeneration. Differences can be made concerning the type of bone graft and osteosynthesis being used. The aim is to create, a stable joint in a good functional position. The position of arthrodesis depends on the patients needs. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis a straight position is generally accepted, where as in patients with degenerative joint desease, a slight wrist extension and ulnar deviation is preferred. A stable osteosynthesis with plates is reliable and allows early rehabilitation. We present 28 cases of arthrodesis with intramedullary rods and 61 cases of arthrodesis with plates. The complication rate was low, the functional results were good. We saw significant reduction of pain, increase of strength and handfunction. Arthrodesis of the wrist joint has proven to be a long term reliable and safe procedure. Loss of motion is accepted to obtain sufficient pain relief.
