  Background Patients with cardiogenic shock refractory to pharmacological therapy have to undergo specific therapeutic procedures which often are not available in a general hospital. The transport of these patients to specialized centers can only be performed using extended circulatory support measures. We established a mobile mechanical circulatory support team responsible for the transport of selected patients to our center for further therapy.
