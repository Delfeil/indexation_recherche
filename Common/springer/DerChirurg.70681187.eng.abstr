 Scaphocapitate fracture syndrome (SCFS) as part of perilunar distorsion injuries (PL, PLF) in the human wrist is still remarkably rare. The diagnosis is determined by careful physical and radiological examinations, including conventional radiographs. Computed tomography can be helpful in detecting such lesions. In our opinion, the high risk of post-traumatic arthrosis because of carpal instability in a osteoligamental injury requires operative reconstruction in nearly all cases. We report the possibility of operative treatment in a case of scaphocapitate fracture syndrome (Fenton) by implantation of 2-mm mini-bone screws, while the use of K-wires or Herbert bone screws has been described in former articles.
