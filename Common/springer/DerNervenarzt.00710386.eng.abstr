In a polydiagnostic study, a systematically recruited collective of 34 women with a first-episode postpartum psychosis was reexamined after a period of 6-26 years (averaging 12.6 years) in order to establish lifetime-diagnoses according to ICD-10 and Leonhard's classification, and to determine course and outcome. According to ICD-10, unipolar depressive disorders (32%) and acute polymorphous psychotic disorders (28%) represented the most frequent diagnoses. Applying Leonhard's classification revealed a marked predominance of cycloid psychoses (62%) with the subform of motility psychosis being the most frequent diagnosis (38%). Schizophrenias occurred rarely according to both classifications.
