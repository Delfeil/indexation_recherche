Two commercially available bacterial filters to be used as part of the mechanical ventilation unit during anaesthesia were tested for hygienic criteria. Manufacturers claim that bacterial breathing filters have a filtration capacity of about 99.995%, so that there would be no need for thermal disinfection of tubing and ventilation circuits after each use. One filter is designed for a single use only, the other can be used up to 24 times after sterilisation. Both filters consist of hydrophobic glass fibres.
