Background: Corneal wound healing is of critical importance for the postoperative outcome of excimer laser PRK. Wound healing is a complex biological process that is well characterised at the microscopic level, but its regulation is poorly understood at the molecular level. Among various cytokines, epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in superficial wound healing. The synthesis of EGF varies individually; therefore, by determining the EGF concentration in the tear fluid, patients with increased wound healing activity might be traced.
