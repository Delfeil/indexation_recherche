Due to its high dynamic range and contrast discernibility, digital radiography offers substantial advantages compared with conventional film-screen systems. Moreover, further advantages can be assumed for radiation protection. Digital radiography also allows conventional image data to be included in PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System). These well-known advantages are faced with legal questions which are not yet settled. Cost effectiveness in using systems of digital radiography and PACS are also under dicussion. By means of examining economic efficiency and cost analysis of digital radiography systems, economic effectiveness was assessed. This was also compared with conventional alternatives. As a result, it may be assumed that amortisation is reached in three to four years. Based on lower costs for films, digital systems are more cost effective than conventional systems after this period.
