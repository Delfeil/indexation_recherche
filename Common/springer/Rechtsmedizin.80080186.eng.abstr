 The Keto-Diabur-Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is an assay for glucose and ketones in urine samples. Positive test results for ketones were obtained during the autopsy of three corpses who probably died following hypothermia, whereas the glucose levels in the urine samples were normal. In all of the three urine samples extremely high acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/L were detected by headspace gas chromatography. A positive test for ketones using the Keto-Diabur-Test 5000 despite of normal glucose levels in urine can support the diagnosis of death due to hyperthermia.
