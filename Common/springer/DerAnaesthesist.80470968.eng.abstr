The introduction of biosensor technology for near bedside measurement of plasma lactate concentrations has been a promising step for critical care profiling. However, methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported. With the advent of a new biosensor (Chiron Diagnostics) and a revised NOVA Biomedical device, accuracy was expected to be improved. The goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods.
