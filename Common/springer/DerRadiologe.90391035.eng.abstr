CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaws (DentaScan) is the method of choice for the radiographic assessment of the mandible and maxilla. It is instrumental in delineating the relationship between bony lesions and the adjacent anatomy. Therefore, this technique allows precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity. Using it, distinct characterization of pathology including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions can be obtained.
