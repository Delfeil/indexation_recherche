Transmyocardial laser revascularization is a modern therapeutic concept for patients with end-stage coronary artery disease not eligible for bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary interventions or heart transplantation. Although the principal idea of creating additional myocardial perfusion from the cavum of the left ventricle was derived from observations in reptile hearts, histological investigations suggest that channel patency is not the underlying mechanism for improved clinical symptoms. Sympathetic denervation and angioneogenesis may be additional explanations for improvement of angina and stress tolerance.
