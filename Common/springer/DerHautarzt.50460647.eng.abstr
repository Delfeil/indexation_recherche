A 34-year-old woman who was 20 weeks pregnant developed pyoderma gangrenosum while receiving treatment for infarct pneumonia. Because of her septic condition an abortion was performed. The patient received intravenous prednisolone as a pulse treatment for her pyoderma gangrenosum, which was followed by oral methylprednisolone and oral dapsone for 6 weeks. After dose reduction the patient had a severe relapse. The steroid dose was increased and dapsone was replaced by cyclosporin A. The smaller ulcers healed spontaneously, but skin grafting had to be performed for the large ulcer. The steroid therapy was tapered and discontinued. Cyclosporin A was continued for 10 weeks as monotherapy. Subsequently, the patient was free of symptoms for 7 months. Twelve months after the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum the patient developed acute myeloid leukaemia accompanied by a recurrence of the skin disease.
