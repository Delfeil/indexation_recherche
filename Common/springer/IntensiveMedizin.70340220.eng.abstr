 The comparison of prediction of mortality and sepsis by different score systems was the objective of this retrospective study in 51 patients. Specific scores for burned patients - "Abbreviated Burn Severity Index" (ABSI) and the "Baltimore Sepsis Scale" (BSS) were compared with the general intensive score systems: "Mortality Prediction Model" (MPM II), "Simplified Acute Physiology Score" (SAPS II), APACHE II (ApII), "Hannover Intensive Score" (HIS) and the sepsis score developed by Elebute and Stoner (ES). On days 1 and 3 the true-positive ratio (sensitivity) was plotted against false-positive ratio (1-specifity) for each score. The area under the curve (max. 1; min. 0.5) correlates with the quality of the score system. We also tested the discrimination of septic and nonseptic patients by using the different scores.
