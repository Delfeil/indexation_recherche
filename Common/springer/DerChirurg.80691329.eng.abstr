 After ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), in addition to postoperative morbidity and functional outcome quality of life is a relevant factor for assessment of the operation's success. Between 1982 and 1997 restorative proctocolectomy was performed in 602 patients (UC: n = 424; FAP: n = 178) at the Department of Surgery, University of Heidelberg. The assessment of pre- and postoperative quality of life was done through a prospective study (before restorative proctocolectomy, before and 1 year after closure of ileostomy). This study (UC: n = 27; FAP: n = 7) revealed a poor preoperative quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis. Proctocolectomy is the decisive factor for the improvement of quality of life in the surgical treatment in UC. Quality of life could not be further significantly improved by ileostomy closure. Before proctocolectomy, FAP patients showed a quality of life, activity and function similar to that of healthy controls. In FAP patients proctocolectomy led to a significant loss of quality of life. This loss could only partly be regained by ileostomy closure. Quality of life and activity comparable to that of healthy controls can be achieved in UC patients by restorative proctocolectomy.
