Methods: Using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), we studied the effects of sevoflurane compared to equipotent doses of isoflurane on blood-flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) before, during, and after general anaesthesia. In random order, 30 patients received sevoflurane (n=15) or isoflurane (n=15) given in stepwise-increasing doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MAC in oxygen/air (FiO2=0.5). Oxygen/air was then replaced by oxygen/nitrous oxide 33%/65% with decreasing doses (1.5, 1.0, 0.5 MAC) of sevoflurane or isoflurane. During each step, ventilation was controlled to provide first normocapnia (end-tidal pCO2=38 mmHg) and then hypocapnia (end-tidal pCO2=27 mmHg). MCA blood-flow velocity and pulsatility, arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature were recorded simultaneously at the end of each period. For statistical analysis, within-group comparison was made by one-way ANOVA. Differences between groups were determined by two-way analysis of variance. Age, weight, and height of the patients were compared using Student's t-test; P<0.05 was considered significant.
