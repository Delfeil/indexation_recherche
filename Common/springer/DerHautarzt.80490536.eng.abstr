The skin is an attractive target tissue for gene therapy. Because of its accessibility, it is suitable for in vivo as well as for ex vivo gene delivery. The ability to monitor the treatment site is an advantage for safety considerations. The epidermis is a self-renewing tissue, which provides the possibility of achieving long-term treatment through gene transfer into keratinocyte stem cells. This opens new perspectives for the treatment of dermatological and even systemic diseases. The possibility for corrective intervention in disorders with inherited gene defects appears particularly attractive.
