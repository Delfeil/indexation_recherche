The overall aim of the present investigation was to develop a technique for endoscopic investigation of the cochlea. In the experiments reported here, the possible effect of the endoscope - called the "cochleoscope" - on the electrophysiology of the cochlea was investigated by recording the cochlear action potential (CAP) threshold tuning curve from (0.1-34 kHz). The dorsolateral bulla of anesthesized guinea pigs (with ketamine 60 mg/kg and Rompun 12 mg/kg) was opened, after which the cochleoscope was introduced under micromanipulator control through the round window membrane. Three cochleoscopes were used and had diameters of 0.29 mm, 0.7 mm and 0.89 mm, respectively, containing 2000, 3000 and 3000 fibers each. Experiments in 7 animals showed that the cochleoscope did not influence CAP thresholds. Although the present resolution of the endoscopes is limited, the basilar membrane can be clearly distinguished from the osseous spiral lamina. It is anticipated that improved resolution will allow the cochleoscope to be used for diagnostic purposes in cases of sensorineural hearing loss.
