The GCT is a primary bone tumor of intermedier dignity, whereby the forecast of the biological behaviour and outcome is impossible on the base of the conventional histological diagnosis. The authors observed in one of their GCT-patients a malignant transformation of the formerly benign tumor. Through announcement of their case the authors want to call the attention to the importance of the DNA-Cytophotometry and to their possible future additional role in the diagnostics of the GCT and in the prediction of their biological behaviour.
