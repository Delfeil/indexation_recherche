Method: In an experimental study on ten isolated human cadaver tendons, the ultrasound anatomy and the reproducibility of aretefacts was determined using 10- and 13-MHz probes. With these in vitro data, the form and diameter of a non-injured tendon were documented in a series of 30 patients between 3 and 60 years old. In a second series of 32 patients with acute, traumatic ruptures of the Achilles tendon and 40 patients with chronic disorders, we distinguished the pathological anatomy.
