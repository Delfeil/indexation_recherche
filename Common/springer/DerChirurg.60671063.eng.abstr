 Lower leg fractures with an osseous defect can be treated effectively with the callus distraction technique by Bier-Ilizarov. Because osteocytes are cultivated at the site of the defect, a real biological system is working - in contrast to other methods. Especially in lower leg fractures with a denuded tibia, the technique of primary shortening to cover the soft-tissue defect with subsequent compensatory lengthening by callus distraction is valuable. This technique does not need special hospitals but skillful surgeons. A closed surgeon-patient relation ship is required because most treatments are done on an outpatient basis. The cosmetic and functional results are good.
