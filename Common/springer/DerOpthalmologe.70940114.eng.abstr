This study was designed to investigate the quality of a scanning and rotating slit delivery system of an ArF-Excimer laser (Nidek EC 5000). The ablation patterns on PMMA samples were examined by REM. The influence of inhomogeneities in the beam profile was simulated on a computer and compared with a conventional large-area ablation system. The impairment of the ablation rate by radiation absorption of the ablation plume was measured as a function of the repetition rate and the application of a fixation ring. The scanning and rotating slit delivery system creates extremely smooth ablation patterns. The delivery system is very tolerant of small-beam inhomogeneities. The ablation rate is very sensitive to the dynamics of the ablation plume. Although the operating procedure takes less time with a large-area ablation system, a scanning and rotating delivery system has the advantage of reliable and homogeneous removal of corneal tissue.
