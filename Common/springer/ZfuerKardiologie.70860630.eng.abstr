  A 47-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with acute anterior myocardial infarction. Immediate coronary angiography was carried out, which showed proximal occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). After mechanical recanalization, a reduction in vessel caliber at the site of occlusion was visible, and balloon angioplasty with consecutive stent implantation because of vessel wall dissection was performed. After the procedure, diameter reduction of the entire vessel segment distal to the stent and muscular bridging with subtotal systolic obliteration of the LAD and one diagonal branch were demonstrated. Diastolic coronary flow did not appear to be limited (TIMI 3). Dipyridamole-thallium cardiac imaging revealed an incomplete perfusion defect of the anteroseptal region and a reversible perfusion reduction of the anterolateral region. For definitive treatment, we decided to implant a 3.0 mm-stent at the site of muscular bridging. Although balloon sizing was adapted to the diameter of the proximal reference segment, measured by quantitative coronary angiography, coronary perforation into the right ventricular outflow tract due to balloon oversizing in the distal dilation segment occurred. The patient remained asymptomatic at rest as well as under exercise testing, and hemodynamics remained stable. Coronary re-angiography after 1 week demonstrated a persistent fistula with complete opacification of the LAD and normal coronary flow (TIMI 3). Within the following 3 months, the coronary fistula closed spontaneously.
