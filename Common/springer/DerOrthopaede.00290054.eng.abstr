Congenital tibial pseudarthrosis (CTP) remains one of the most challenging problems in paediatric orthopaedic surgery. With the abandonment of older grafting techniques in favor of vascularized fibular transplants or the Ilizarov method the final outcome has improved and made the prognosis for patients less cumbersome. Using the latter technique in 10 patients, a success rate of 90 % could be reached. Nevertheless, although solid healing occurs in most of the patients nowadays, this is often at the cost of multiple operations before a definite well united, equalized and normally aligned limb can be obtained.
