 Given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock, immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy. Many agents have been studied that have the therapeutic potential to interfere with cytokines and other pathways which are activated during sepsis. Drugs having the properties to neutralize lipopolysaccharides have also been considered. So far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents (HA1A, E5, anti TNF antibodies, ILra) have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit. In certain trials results were indecisive, or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies. In certain other trials, like those on antibodies against TNF, some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients. Thus, new trials are on their ways. So far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re-examine the concept of immunomodulation, and to redefine strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host, while not putting him at risk.
