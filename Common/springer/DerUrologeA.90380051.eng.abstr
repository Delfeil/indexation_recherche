The intravesical instillation of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) in cases of relapsed superficial bladder cancer is an acknowledged kind of prophylaxis. It is uncertainly up to now whether a verification of the immune systems competence is necessary. The recommendations in this problem are very different. In conclusion to the recent literature we think that a verification of the immune system before BCG installation in the urinary bladder has not a prognostic value. Additionally, the legal obligingness of this immunotest is doubtful.
