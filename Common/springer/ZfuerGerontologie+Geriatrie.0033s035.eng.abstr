 Physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status, mobility, and quality of life. However, the central focus of this contribution is not on illness-specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training. These two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process. The spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated. Even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible. Adequate usage of these training methods contributes to increased competence and a minimization of risks in daily life.
