 The pharmacological and/or electrical conversion of atrial fibrillation implicates considerable complications which in some cases can even cause the death of a patient. Proarrhythmias, embolizations, hemorrhages, bradycardia, and left ventricular failure partially with following death have been reported. The complication rate of pharmacological conversion is highest in the first 1-3 days; the complication rate of electrical conversion in the first 24 hours. Therefore, both forms of conversion have to be performed with continuous monitoring and the back up of an intensive care unit. That implicates that a clinical setting is necessary for any kind of conversion.
