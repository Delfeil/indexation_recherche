 An unusual shaped piece of skin was found in the oral cavity of a woman who had been stabbed to death. Physical examination of the victim's numerous male acquaintances revealed one to have an injury of the same shape on the ventral surface of the left ring finger. Molecular biological investigations showed that this suspect and the piece of skin exhibited corresponding DNA patterns (frequency 1 : 700 000). This case underlines the importance of physical examination as a preliminary to further detailed investigation.
