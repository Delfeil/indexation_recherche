Abstract.  Introduction: The treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily. Current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation (OCT) and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT). Methods: With a prospective clinical investigation, at the time being with 2-year results, we have examined ACT in comparison to OCT in 20 patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological (histology, immunohistochemistry, RES) outcome. Results: We found equally good results with both methods in Lysholm, Meyers and Tegner Activity Scores. Histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after ACT showed a defect filling in all cases, mainly with fibrous cartilage, while localized areas of hyalinelike regenerative cartilage were documented near the base.We did not see any histomorphologically visible change in the transplants after OCT. Conclusion: At the time we prefer OCT instead of ACT given the correct indication.
