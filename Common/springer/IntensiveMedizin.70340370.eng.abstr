 The vasodilatory prostanoids PGE1 and PGI2 possess strong vasodilatory potency in the pulmonary circulation. Their application is, however, limited by the lack of pulmonary and intrapulmonary selectivity. By use of chronic ambulatory PGI2-infusion, patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) may be bridged for (heart-) lung transplantation. In patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), PGE1 and PGI2 lower the pulmonary vascular resistance, but may also decrease the systemic pressure (limited pulmonary selectivity) and increase ventilation-perfusion-mismatch, accompanied by an impairment of gas exchange (limited intrapulmonary selectivity). Application of PGI2 via the transbronchial route (aerosol) may achieve pulmonary and intrapulmonary selectivity with an efficacy profile comparable to that of the selective pulmonary vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). Repetitive aerosol application of the stable PGI2 analogue iloprost is under consideration for long-term treatment of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension such as primary pulmonary hypertension.
