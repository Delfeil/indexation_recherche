Diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders is difficult due to the large physiologic variability of bolus transport. With the help of a parametric multiple swallow technique (introduced by Tatsch), using "condensed images" of each single swallow action before creating a "mean image" of six swallows, this problem can be solved. For testing this relatively new method, 12 patients underwent 16 pairs of parametric esophageal scintigraphy and esophageal manometry. This collective of patients consisted of 4 with achalasia and secondary hypomobility of the tubular esophagus, 7 with unspecific esophageal dysfunction confirmed by manometry and 1 with clinical dysphagia and normal status in manometry. Fourteen of 15 pathological manometric findings could be confirmed with parametric scintigraphy. Esophageal manometry was false negative in one case and esophageal scintigraphy in another one case. The calculated emptying rates 10 and 12 s after beginning of swallowing are (mean  +/-  SD) 56  +/-  34 % and 60  +/-  34 % respectively for solid meal and 54  +/-  25 % 57  +/-  22 % respectively for liquid meal. Of 60 emptying rates, 48 are in the pathologic range of less than 80 %. As expected, no significant difference was found between emptying rates after 10 and 12 s (two-tailed matched pairs t -test, 5 % significance level). In conclusion, parametric esophageal multiple swallow scintigraphy has been proven to be a non-invasive and sensitive tool for pre- and posttherapeutic care of patients with esophageal motility disorders. It should be mentioned that esophageal scintigraphy can give additional information in some cases of normal esophageal manometry.
