According to the concept of attachment styles as distinct adaptive patterns of perceptions, thoughts, feelings, expectations and action tendencies in attachment-relevant situations (Bowlby 1975; Ainsworth et al. 1978; Main 1990), we tried to portray these patterns in adequate operationalisations i.e. as distinguished configurations of personal characteristics. Descriptions of each of the three attachment styles "secure", "avoidant" and "ambivalent" were translated into terms of self-descriptions given by clients imagining their future psychotherapeutic relationship. Following the results of factor analysis three scales were constructed: "problems in feeling accepted", "readiness for self-disclosure" and "need for care". N=374 inpatients (56,3% female, 43,7% male) at the beginning of psychotherapy completed the BFKE. Cluster analysis resulted in five clusters, which can be interpreted as attachment styles: "secure", two subgroups of the "ambivalent" ("withdrawing" and "clinging") and two subgroups of the "avoidant" style ("withdrawing" and "cooperative"). Discriminant analysis of the clusters led to discriminant functions corresponding with the results of Collins and Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al. (1978).
