In a comparative analysis of 29 studies, maximal androgen deprivation (MAD) was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation. Thus, MAD cannot be regarded as the new gold standard. Most trials focus on quality of life which - given the palliative aim of the treatment - deserves special attention. This aspect has not yet been evaluated, however, in the largest multicenter study, Intergroup study 0105. In patients with advanced bone metastasis or severe pain, MAD treatment should be begun because of the flare phenomenon. The synergistic effects of LHRH agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated. Since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum-PSA levels under MAD does not delay progression, the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not MAD should be begun.
