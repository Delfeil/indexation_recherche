Aqueous ethanolic extracts of Vitex Agnus castus have well-characterised dopaminergic effects which block pituitary prolactin secretion. In women suffering from latent hyperprolactinaemia the exaggerated prolactin secretion in response to stress or deep sleep phases is significantly reduced under treatment with Agnus castus preparations. This appears to be why Agnus castus preparations are beneficial in the treatment of premenstrual mastodynia. The dopaminergic effects of Vitex Agnus castus may also be effective in the nigrostrial and in the mesolimbic dopaminergic systems and therefore also beneficial in the treatment of psychic and other vegetative premenstrual symptoms.
