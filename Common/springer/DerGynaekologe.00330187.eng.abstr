Due to the basic digital technology of modern sonography, a large number of new features have become available. It is easy for the sonographer to employ an ultrasound improvement such as 3D, but other developments, like the networking of ultrasound devices, are less well known. The following applications demonstrate the benefits of the new technological advances: (1) digital imaging and communication according to the DICOM standard; (2) telesonography; and (3) remote control and maintenance of ultrasound devices. These advantages are not widely used because of the lack of user-friendly plug-and-play features of the network-enabled devices. On the other hand, mobile devices are already available. In the near future it will be possible to use a mobile ultrasound machine as a mobile telesonography workstation, in combination with the high-speed mobile telephony protocol UMTS.
