  Background: Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to selectively lower pulmonary vascular resistance and is applied in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT). However, application and monitoring is complex and not always successful ("non-responders"). We evaluated the effect of aerolized prostacyclin (aePGI2) as a therapeutic alternate to NO.
