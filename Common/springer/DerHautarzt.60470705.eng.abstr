Paraffinomas of the male genitalia are now rare. We report on a Russian patient with subcutaneous nodules of the penis and the prepuce. Injections of exogenous lipids into the male genitalia are still performed in many Eastern European countries. Thus, a paraffinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous nodules of the male genitalia in patients from these areas.
