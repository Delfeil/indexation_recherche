Purpose: It was the aim of this project to examine (i) the relationships between contrast-enhanced dynamic MR imaging derived characteristics and histologic microvessel density counts - a recognized surrogate of tumor angiogenesis - from tumors in patients with primary or recurrent cancer of the uterine cervix, and (ii) to correlate these parameters with lymphatic involvement (i. e. lymphatic channels) to assess tumorbiological aggressiveness in terms of lymphatic spread.
