The use of autotransfusion devices is an established method of reducing the need for homologous transfusions in surgery [3, 11, 13], but technical factors still contraindicate the washing and concentration of blood volumes smaller than 300 ml. Therefore, haemoconcentration of small volumes of salvaged blood, as usually found in paediatric surgery, is considered to be a complicated and questionable practice [5]. Whereas these amounts of blood loss are easily tolerated by adults, they may necessitate homologous transfusions in paediatric surgery. In a prospective study, we investigated whether a simple technical modification in the processing of salvaged blood could facilitate the use of autotransfusion devices, especially in children.
