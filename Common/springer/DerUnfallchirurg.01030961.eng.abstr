From 1978 to 1999, 22 patients (17 male, 5 female) who suffered apophyseal fractures of the pelvis and femoral lesser trochanter (18 patients by avulsion, 4 patients by direct trauma) were treated. The median age of the patients was 12.5 years (range, 1-16 years). Eighteen patients were injured during sports activities. Predominantly the anterior inferior iliac spine (n=9) was affected, followed by fractures of the femoral lesser trochanter (n=3), periacetabular rim (n=3), anterior superior iliac spine (n=2), and iliac crest (n=2), retrospectively. The diagnosis was established using plain x-ray films. The treatment was conservative in 21 patients (95%) and operative in one (5%). Of the patients, 20 (91%) were followed-up for a median interval of 12 months (3 weeks to 84 months). At follow-up, 15 patients (75%) reported that they were free of pain during sport activities, while five patients (25%), at an average time of 33 months after accident, complained of pain at the former fracture site when exercising vigorously during sport. At clinical examination no patient was found suffering from limitation of ROM (range of motion), adjacent joints, or muscular insufficiency. Plain x-rays of affected apophyses confirmed good consolidation and dislocation of not more than 3 cm in all patients.
