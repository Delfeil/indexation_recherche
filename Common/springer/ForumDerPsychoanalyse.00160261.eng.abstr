Object relationships developed in the treatment of patients with psychosomatic disorders require specific measures in handling the analyst's countertransference. Frequently feelings of tedium and emptiness as defence against either helplessness and futility may be experienced or, on the other hand, fantasies of omnipotence or magical healing powers. Comprehending one's repressed emotional responses contributes to a beneficial analytical process, in the course of which the analyst is appropriated as a Siamese self-object. The specific quality of this object relationship adds intrinsic significance beyond the normal scope of analytical work on the patient's relationships with his family. On the basis of the dynamics of the self-object relationship insight into the processes of transference and countertransference and therapeutic consequences are developed.
