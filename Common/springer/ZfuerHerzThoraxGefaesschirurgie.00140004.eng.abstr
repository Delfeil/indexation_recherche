 Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a severe complication after heart valve replacement. Incidence ranges in literature between 0.1% and 2.3% (mean 0.4%) per patient year (pty). PVE is classified as "early" or "late" (occurence within or after 60 days following heart valve replacement). In this review we present the clinical outcome of PVE as well as the most common diagnostic criteria (Duke criteria), the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria. The spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards.
