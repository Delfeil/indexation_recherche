Administration of highly concentrated, highly potent, and therefore highly dangerous drugs with syringe pumps is common in modern anaesthesia as well as in intensive care and emergency medicine. Because of their exact flow rates down to <1 ml/h, these pumps are predestined for delivery of drugs with short half-lives, such as catecholamines and vasodilators. But intravenous application of drugs with syringe pumps is not without problems. While it is well known that syringes not fixed correctly into the pump can empty themselves by the influence of gravity, it seems not to be known that hydrostatic pressure can influence the flow rate of a correctly connected system even during continuous infusion. In this situation a change of height of the syringe pump in relation to the patient's position can have tremedous effects on hemodynamics due to unintended acceleration or deceleration of the flow rate. This case report demonstrates that the elevation of a connected epinephrine pump while moving a cardiac surgery patient after ACB operation from the operation table into his bed led to critical increases of heart rate, blood pressure and left atrial pressure. In order to quantify the problem we repeated the situation experimentally. It could be demonstrated that the elevation of the syringe pump by 80-100 cm delivers an additional bolus of 4-5 drops as the central venous catheter outlet. Lowering the pump consecutively leads to the opposite effect. In the case reported, the accidentally administered bolus of epinephrine was 12-15 µg (we use a concentration of 60 µg/ml epinephrine for continuous infusion with syringe pumps). From this accidental observation the following conclusion can be drawn: The change of height, in relation to the patient's position, of a running syringe pump during continuous infusion of highly concentrated cardiovascular drugs may cause considerable, even life-threatening hemodynamic disorders. Even in a closed infusion system (syringe-extension-central venous catheter), hydrostatic pressure influences infusion rate. Elevation of the pump leads to unintended bolus administration, and lowering of the pump is followed by an interruption of the infusion. In the knowledge of this phenomenon, unexpected hemodynamic reactions during transport of critically ill patients cannot always be interpreted as a result of inadequate anesthesia or volume load, but may be a consequence of incorrect handling of the syringe pumps as described in this report.
