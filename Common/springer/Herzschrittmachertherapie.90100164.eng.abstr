 Though the problem of interference of pacemakers under high voltage power lines has been described already 1983, it can not be regarded as solved. The question, therefore, should be answered how large are the fields beneath power lines and which sensing thresholds are to be programmed to overcome the problem.  While the electric field under power lines are constant with respect to time but depend on distance, height, and voltage, the magnetic field varies depending on load. With the maximum electric field of 5.24kV/m and magnetic field of 14.3µT, it can be calculated that the electrically influenced voltage amounts to 2.2mV, whereas the magnetically induced voltage remains below 0.3mV. Both voltages must be added for the most unfavorable case.  Investigating 134 DDD pacemakers removed from deceased patients revealed that the most sensitive one reacted already at 0.85mV 50Hz signals, 23% of all would be influenced at 2mV. The most sensitive pacemaker would, according to our calculations, be interfered with an electric field of 2kV/m. Magnetic fields under powerlines can not influence pacemakers. To remove all dangers from pacemaker patients under high voltage power lines, unipolar systems should have a ventricular sensing threshold of at least 5mV.
