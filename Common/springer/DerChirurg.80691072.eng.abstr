 Sentinel lymph node (SN) biopsy in primary breast cancer seems to be an alternative to complete axillary lymph node dissection for evaluation of the axillary lymph node status in selected patients. Following evaluation of the technique of SN biopsy, we applied SN biopsy clinically to 23 selected patients. A lymphoscintigraphy was performed preoperatively to evaluate lymphatic drainage. The SN was identified in the operating room by use of a hand-held gamma camera and a blue vital dye. The SN was found in all 23 patients. In 17/23 the SN was tumor free and no axillary dissection was performed; 6/23 showed a positive SN and complete axillary dissection was done. Intraoperative lymphatic mapping and SN biopsy may be the treatment of choice for evaluation of axillary node status in selected patients, for it combines accurate nodal staging and low morbidity.
