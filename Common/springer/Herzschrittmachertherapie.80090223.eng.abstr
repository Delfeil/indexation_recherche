 Catheter ablation by means of radiofrequency energy (RF) is an established method in the treatment of various forms of supraventricular and atrioventricular tachycardias. In patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), the success of catheter ablation depends on the pathophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmia and on the underlying heart disease.
