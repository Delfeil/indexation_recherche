  Although heart transplantation is by now considered an established procedure in patients with terminal heart failure, there has been a stagnation or even a decline in the number of transplantations performed due to the decreased willingness of the public to provide organs. As a consequence of this development patients have to wait for a donor organ for a much longer waiting period. The aim of this study was to examine patients especially during this very stressful period. From July 1995 to February 1997, 62 patients who had been continuously added to the waiting list were examined regarding their quality of life and emotional state. Completely assessed were 53 patients (participation rate: 85%). As compared to a healthy control group, patients with terminal heart failure on the waiting list reported their quality of life in the physical as well as the psychological area as significantly lower (p<0.001). The areas of depression (p<0.001) and anxiety (p<0.001) also showed a significant difference. There was an obvious correlation (p<0.001) between the key symptom of terminal heart failure - dyspnoea - and the measured level of depression. This served to support the notion that there is a connection between the psychological and the somatic state in these severely ill patients. These results point to the necessity of supportive psychotherapeutic treatment during this very stressful time.
