 Nasal swabs were taken in 16-drug-related deaths (cotton wool buds) and 6 bodies exhibited fresh puncture marks indicative of intravenous drug application. In all these cases, only traces of opiates or cocaine or its metabolite at the most could be shown in the nasal swabs. In 10 cases no puncture marks were present. These nasal swabs contained relevant drug quantities as far as opiates and/or cocaine were involved. There was no evidence of diacetylmorphine (heroin) in any nasal swab, although monoacetylmorphine could be detected at a level mostly in the range of 30%-100% of the morphine concentrations. In the swabs with positive cocaine results there was evidence of markedly more cocaine than benzoylecgonine. The results of our investigation prove that examination of a nasal swab collected from deaths by drug intoxication can give good indications on the way the drug has been applied.
