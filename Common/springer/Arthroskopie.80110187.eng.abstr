A total of 36 patients suffering from osteochondrosis dissecans or posttraumatic osteochondral defects of the talus were treated by arthroscopy in a prospective outpatient design. All of the patients were re-evaluated after 4 and  12 months in a standardized follow-up protocol. Of the patients two thirds reported a traumatic event in their medical history, this ratio being significantly higher in laterally located osteochondral lesions. Conventional radiographic examination turned out to give reliable predictions of stage and localization of osteochondrosis. Although more than 50% of the lesions were located in the dorsal part of the talus, all of them could be arthroscopically accessed without need of malleolar osteotomy, tibial drilling or joint distraction. Furthermore, arthroscopy enables synovectomy in cases of reactive synovitis as well as the removal of osteophytes at the anterior tibia. Owing to the low rat of complication, the short rehabilitation time and the good postoperative results, arthroscopic debridement and drilling are considered to be the treatments of choice for osteochondral defects of the talus.
