The creep and wear behaviour of Chirulen, Hylamer and Enduron, materials which differ only in their manufacturing procedures, was examined and compared. Chirulen is manufactured by being pressed into form by plates, whereas Hylamer and Enduron are shaped by tubes. Hylamer differs from Enduron in that intermediate material processing is undertaken with the goal of improving the initial material. The wear and deformation rate was determined by means of the ring-on-disc testing device after 360,000 cycles and after 1.0 x 106 cycles, respectively. The static tests for the determination of wear were carried out at a contact stress of 5.62 MPa and a testing time of 100 h in analogy to the ring-on-disc tests. Chirulen and Hylamer demonstrated comparable wear with a tendency toward a lower wear rate in Hylamer, while Enduron presented a clearly higher wear rate.
