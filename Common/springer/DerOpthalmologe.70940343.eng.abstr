"Classic" choroidal neovascularization (CNV) has a relatively uniform appearance in fluorescein angiography. In contrast, indocyanine green (ICG) angiography shows variable features of well-defined CNV. We examined 31 classic CNV patients secondary to age-related macular degeneration using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Angiograph) in order to determine ICG characteristics of classic CNV. Vascular patterns (97%), a hypofluorescent rim (84%), a hyperfluorescent margin (42%), late ICG leakage (32%) and "feeder vessels" were identified in variable frequency. Some of the ICG characteristics may correlate with histological features of the membrane and reflect proliferative activity. Extrafoveal "feeder vessels" may be amenable to laser photocoagulation in the presence of subfoveal CNV.
