Taking into account the different concepts of delusion and analysing rational and intuitive cognition, the present phenomenological-conceptual study aims at defining the essential nature of delusion. Intuitive cognition as a result of holistic processing is founded in the development of polysensoric-kinaesthetic basic pictures (eidetic matrices), which are recognized preverbally and prereflexively by subliminal perception of corresponding eidetic structures. A positive match between a matrix and a given phenomenon produces an eidetic feeling. This eidetic feeling encompasses three aspects. The first is a preverbal knowledge of something as something definite. As a direct self-reference, the second is the feeling of an object-inherent significance of the given phenomenon for the subject itself. Thirdly, a power vector is perceived to derive from the object. The application of this concept allows us to consider delusion as a disturbance in the system of holistic information processing. This disturbance is characterized by a disinhibition and actualization of eidetic matrices in different ways. The resulting eidetic feeling we call delusion; its expression in thoughts and words we call a delusional idea. All features of an eidetic feeling can be demonstrated in delusion. Owing to their special intensity and suspended reason, they mostly appear to be unique. The analysis of the eidetic structures of delusion allows a deeper understanding of delusion and facilitates both its diagnosis and its differentiation. Heterogeneous terms, such as delusional mood, idea of meaning, idea of reference, delusional notion and delusional perception emerge in an understandable context.
