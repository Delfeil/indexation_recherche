 Intensive scores like APACHE II and SAPS II have been developed to estimate the probability of hospital mortality of ICU patients. They can be used to evaluate and compare the efficiency of intensive care units. The role of these multipurpose scores in studies concerning patients with a specific disease has yet to be defined. The aim of this study was to validate and compare the APACHE II and SAPS II score in patients with sepsis who were admitted to the medical intensive care unit of a university hospital. We examined retrospectively 140 patients who presented with the clinical signs of severe sepsis or septic shock according to the American Consensus Conference. The physiologic and anamnestic variables for both scores were evaluated at the time the diagnosis of sepsis was made and on the third treatment day. The 60 female (43%) and 80 male (57%) patients had a mean ( +/- SA) age of 48 +/- 16.7 years. 87 of the patients (62%) required mechanical ventilation, 35 (25%) needed hemodialysis or hemofiltration, 12 (9%) required resuscitation. The mean stay on the ICU was 14 +/- 12.6 days. Mortality at day 28 was 50/140 (36%); the overall hospital mortality was 57/140 (41%). The predicted mortality according to APACHE II was 35%; according to SAPS II (25%), the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were 1.2 resp. 1.4. Goodness of fit analyses proved a sufficient calibration for the APACHE II score and significant differences (p = <0.01) of observed and predicted mortality for the SAPS II score. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with different underlying disease and for patients with or without septic shock. Patients without underlying disease (WD, n = 55), severe underlying disease (SD, n = 38) or immunosuppressive disease (ID, n = 47) had a significantly different observed mortality of 25% (WD) vs. 45% (SD) vs. 55% (ID) (p<0.01). Patients without septic shock had a mortality rate of 11%, in contrast to patients with shock, who had a mortality of 47% (p<0.001). Neither the influence of the underlying disease nor of septic shock were detected by any of the two scores. While the mortality risk of patients without shock was overestimated [SMR 0.5 (Apache) resp. 0.73 (SAPS)], the risk of patients with shock was underestimated by both scores [SMR 1.2 (APACHE) resp. 1.6 (SAPS)].
