 Up till now psychoanalytic psychotherapy confronted itself not very often with the challenges of quality assurance. Moreover, in the rare articles about this topic the specific characteristics of psychoanalytic therapy were not considered. The reasons for this strained relationship are on the one hand the difficulties between the conceptual guidelines of quality assurance and on the other hand the self-conception of psychoanalytic psychotherapy and inner conflicts of psycho-analytic psychotherapy revived through quality assurance. These problems lead to lack of interest and distance of the psychoanalytic therapy towards quality assur-ance. In case of unavoidable confrontation intense aggressive affects emerge, which impair the institutional self-assertion and the further conceptual development of psychoanalytic psychotherapy.
