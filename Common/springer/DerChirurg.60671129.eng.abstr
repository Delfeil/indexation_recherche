 Open reduction and internal fixation of intra-articular calcaneus fractures have been increasingly emphasized in recent years. Operation of most of these fractures is via an extended lateral approach. Different implants are used to stabilize the often complex fractures. We have developed a low contact plate that is specially designed for calcaneal fractures. Because the design is based on the anatomy of the calcaneus, all types of fractures can be treated. The plate has a large number of holes to accommodate screw fixation. Our results in 36 cases were comparable to those of other series using open reduction and internal fixation with plates and the demands on the plate were fulfilled.
