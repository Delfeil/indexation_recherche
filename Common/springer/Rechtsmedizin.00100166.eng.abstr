Asthma is a widespread disease with an increasing prevalence. In spite of improved therapeutic strategies some cases can still take a fatal course. A total of 21 cases of acute death in asthmatics were analysed (12 females and 9 males, aged between 2 and 75 years old), whereby 18 cases happened at home (mostly at night), 1 in a hospital, 1 in a nursing-home and 1 in a prison. A history of asthmatic attacks, chronic asthmatic lesions and signs of acute airway obstruction and right cardiac failure were characteristic for all cases. Forensic investigations included questions of external violence, intoxication or incorrect medical treatment.
