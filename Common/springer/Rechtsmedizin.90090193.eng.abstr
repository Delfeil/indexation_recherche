 A case of prenatal paternity diagnosis where the woman had been raped is presented. PCR-VNTR polymorphisms were investigated on material which was obtained by biopsy during the 10th week of pregnancy. After DNA extraction nine PCR-VNTR polymorphisms were examined and the husband of the pregnant woman could not be excluded as the biological father of the child with a high degree of certainty. The ethical aspects associated with this problem will be discussed.
