Due to a configuration defect, the use of membrane-guided bone regeneration or alveolar ridge extension is required. The bone splitting and bone spreading technique was modified by developing the osteotome technique and the osteotome kit (Summers 1994). Lateral and apical bone displacement and condensation are the principles of this nonablative implant bed preparation technique. Estimation of the periimplant bone level is one of the important prognostic parameters for estimating implant survival. The level of the alveolar crest near implants which were inserted using the osteotome technique was investigated by measuring the differences between the alveolar crest and the implant shoulder in postoperative radiographs after implant insertion and after uncovering the implants in 17 patients. The osteotome technique was used in bone quality D2 and D3 according to the classification by Misch (1993). Significant differences were found between the bone levels after implant insertion and implant uncovering. A significant correlation (r = 0,5466; P = 0,023) was calculated between the differences of the marginal bone level at implantation and uncovering time and the bone quality. There should be strict indications for using the osteotome technique for evaluating the bone quality found at the implant site to optimize the long-term prognosis of the implants.
