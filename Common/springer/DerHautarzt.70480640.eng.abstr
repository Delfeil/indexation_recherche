Bart syndrome was described first by Bart in 1966; it represents the combination of congenital epidermolysis bullosa, congenital localized absence of skin affecting the extremities and shedding or dystrophy of nails. This syndrome may be of clinical relevance because of its more favourable prognosis in comparison with other forms of epidermolysis bullosa. We report two patients with Bart syndrome and focus on the question, if this syndrome represents a distinct entity or a variant of epidermolysis bullosa.
