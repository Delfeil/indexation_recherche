A 26-year-old man sustained a C2 arc fracture. Ventral spondylodesis using an H-plate was performed. The patient developed a pharyngovertebral fistula which remained undetected for 1 year. Spontaneous fusion of C3/C4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred. The fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was transorally removed. No further problems occurred after this unusual method of treatment. The anatomy of the cervical spine, special problems of intensive care patients and the use of proper instrumentation are discussed.
