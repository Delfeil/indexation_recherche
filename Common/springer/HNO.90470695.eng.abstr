The objective of this trial was to analyse the predictive character of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in the sera of patients with advanced carcinomas of the head and neck treated by primary radiochemotherapy. From 1992 to 1995,  25 patients with UICC stage cancers and one patient with stage III disease were treated in the departments of otolaryngology and radio-oncology of the University of Heidelberg according to a protocol of accelerated concomitant boost radiochemotherapy with carboplatin. The serum levels of VEGF, bFGF and MMP-2 were measured by enzyme-linked radiosorbent assay and data were correlated with followup findings (median time of follow up: 60 months). Patients with serum levels above normal were detected for VEGF in 4 patients, MMP-2 in 7 patients and for bFGF in 13 patients. An increase in bFGF serum levels above the upper limit of normal controls was significantly associated with a shorter time of locoregional control (P=0.036). In a covariate analysis bFGF proved to be independent of other prognostic factors, such as age, site, total tumor volume and response to therapy. No prognostic relevance of VEGF and MMP2 serum levels could be determined. The present suggest that bFGF is an independent prognostic factor for tumor control in advanced head and neck cancer after primary radiochemotherapy.
