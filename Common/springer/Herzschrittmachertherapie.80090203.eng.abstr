 There is growing interest in repolarization disturbances for risk stratification of patients after acute myocardial infarction. The QT interval is subject to a variety of influencing factors, of which heart rate, sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, different drugs, and electrolyte imbalances play a major role. QT interval measurement is not standardized regarding the standard ECG lead to measure and the number of measured QT intervals. There are different T-wave morphologies in the standard ECG leads, which often make correct determination of the end of the T-wave rather difficult.  Only little information exists about reference values of QT interval duration in healthy subjects, which show age- and gender-dependent differences. Moreover, some studies showed that QT interval duration is changing with time.  Apart from the congenital long QT syndrome there is major interest in the acquired long QT syndromes, which are primarily drug induced, and in the value of QT interval prolongation in predicting sudden cardiac death and life-threatening arrhythmias in patients after acute myocardial infarction.  Some epidemiologic studies demonstrated only a limited prognostic value of QT interval prolongation. On the other hand, several studies revealed a significant relationship between QT interval prolongation and the occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias in the early postinfarction period. The value of QT interval prolongation predicting long-term prognosis in patients after acute myocardial infarction is not clearly evident in different studies and needs further investigation.
