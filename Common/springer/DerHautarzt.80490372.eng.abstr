Across the boundaries of the medical specialties we have realized how important the concepts of quality of life and disease-related coping behavior are to understand the patients' subjective perception of the medical condition and its treatment. Although standardized instruments are already available for different medical indications and even in the related fields of peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases, phlebology still lacks standardized concepts for evaluating quality of life and/or disease-related coping behavior in patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). We report on a newly developed instrument specifically designed for recording quality of life in patients with CVI. It not only meets the requirements of psychometric standards, but has also proven its applicability in clinical use. The "Tübingen Questionnaire for measuring Quality of Life in patients with CVI (TLQ-CVI)" and the results of a study on quality of life in 142 patients with various stages of chronic venous insufficiency are presented. It was possible to distinguish between Stage I/II and Stage III CVI patients with respect to parameters such as "leg complaints" and "day-to-day fears and worries". These convey clinically relevant insights into the patient's subjective perception of the disease and how they cope. The information gathered provides a set of reasonable target scores for clinical studies presently being carried out at various study centers in Germany incorporating the TLQ-CVI.
