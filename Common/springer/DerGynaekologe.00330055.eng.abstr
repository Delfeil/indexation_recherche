So far, only a few studies about the effects of nature cure on male infertility have been published. Most data are available for application of acupuncture in andrological patients. Since randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled studies cannot be easily performed with acupuncture, it is difficult to interpret the possible effects on semen quality. Significant improvement in pregnancy rates and standard semen parameters after treatment with Chinese medical herbs has been reported in the Chinese scientific literature. However, almost all manuscripts are written in Chinese language or are not available in German libraries. Therefore, only English abstracts with insufficient data can be evaluated. Studies about homeopathic treatment of male infertility have not yet been performed. Most reports about positive effects on semen quality are based on unpublished observations and case reports.
