Background: The rapid integration of new technology into ophthalmologic practice, e. g. LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis), is associated with new complications. The limitations of the new technology cannot be precisely determined. During lamellar cuts with microkeratomes intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations occur. The IOP elevation during the lamellar cut cannot be determined by conventional tonometry.
