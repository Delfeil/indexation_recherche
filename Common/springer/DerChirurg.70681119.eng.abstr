 The retrospective results of carbon prostheses for knee ligament reconstruction in 120 patients, as established by questionnaire, are reported at 10  +/-  2 years follow-up. Eighty patients could also be reviewed clinically. Some 60 % of the patients showed good subjective function at reduced activity level. Complications were seen in 72.5 % of the patients with rupture of the carbon prosthesis and in 68 % of those with synovitis. X-ray showed osteoarthritis in up to 59 % of the patients. Carbon prostheses for collateral ligament reconstruction (85 % medial, 5.8 % lateral) were successful in 75 % of cases. Activity and time seem to be less responsible for failure of the carbon prostheses than the features of growing in. Destruction of the knee joint over time is due to reactive synovitis and catabolic enzyme reaction and correlates with joint effusion and pain. If these problems appear, (arthroscopic) resection of the synovia is indicated to interrupt the circulus vitiosus.
