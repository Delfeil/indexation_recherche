Therapy of the heterogenous group of primary cutaneous B- and T-cell lymphomas is based upon type of lymphoma and its staging. Treatment, especially for rare forms, has not yet been standardised. Two patients with uncommon primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas received both traditional therapy and topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) in areas that are difficult to reach with classic methods (ear, eyebrow, side of foot). The first patient had a rare type of medium/large cell pleomorphic, CD8-positive, CD30-negative, primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with primary involvement of the ear. As the tumor progressed during PUVA, interferon  and retinoid therapy, topical PDT was employed. A histologically confirmed partial remission was obtained. As the disease further evolved the patient received radiotherapy and has now been in complete remission for 10 months. The other patient preserted with the classical picture of mycosis fungoides in initial tumour stage. This patient received in addition to PUVA therapy and interferon , topical PDT to the eyebrow and side of the foot.  A complete remission was achieved and  histologically confirmed. In the palliative treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, PDT is a new experimental method, especially for problem locations. It is tissue sparing, has few side effects, can be repeated as often as necessary and achieves good cosmetic  results.
