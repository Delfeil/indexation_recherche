Background: Most germs causing postoperative endophthalmitis derive from the conjunctival bacterial normal flora. Postoperative endophthalmitis is often induced by staphylococcal germs. The application of polyvidone-iodine solution to the conjunctiva is one possibility to reduce potential endophthalmitis-causing bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 1 % polyvidone-iodine solution concerning the reduction of colonization with staphylococci in the course of intraocular surgery. This is to evaluate the effectiveness of 1 % polyvidone-iodine solution concerning coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci.
