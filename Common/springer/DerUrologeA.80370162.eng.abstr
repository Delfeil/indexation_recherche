For patients with advanced prostate cancer efficient therapy of painfull bony lesions is the primary goal of interdisciplinary treatment strategies. Preservation of quality of life appears to be the main aim rather than prolongation of life. Apart from oral pain relief and local irradiation systemic treatment with radionuclides offers low-risk radiotherapeutic strategies for the palliation of painful, multifocal osteoplastic bone metastases. Depending on the radiopharmaceutical substance chosen response and reduction of pain are described in 65-80 %. The duration of pain relief lasts between 6-12 weeks. During this time the morphine based medication can be reduced and in some cases withdrawn which positively effects quality of life. After improvement of myelosuppression treatment with radionuclides can be repeated. Patients have to be hospitalized for two days because of protection from radiation procedures.
