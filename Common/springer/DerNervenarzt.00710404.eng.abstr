The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in HIV-infected patients is high. The differential diagnosis includes psychoreactive disorders, acute psychiatric symptoms of an HIV-associated encephalopathy, and symptomatic psychotic illnesses due to secondary neurologic manifestations such as opportunistic central nervous infections and intracerebral lymphoma. Clinical aspects and psychopathological findings are not sufficient for differential diagnosis and identification of primarily psychiatric disorders. Secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging (CT, MRI) and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. In emergency situations, however, German law imposes strict regulations, especially in the case of sectioned patients. These medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and propositions for an effective strategy are made.
