The growth of a cholesteatoma requires angioneogenesis in the connective tissue of the perimatrix. Angioneogenesis is also needed for wound healing as a host response to tissue injury. Normal wound repair is conducted through a wide number of growth factors. Basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) plays a pivotal role in wound repair. This cytokine exerts its effects through stimulation of a wide range of target cells. B-FGF is chemotactic and mitogenic for fibroblasts, endothelial cells and keratinocytes. In addition, b-FGF can stimulate the production of collagenase and plasminogen activators to enhance fibroblast proliferation and angioneogenesis. Its necessity for normal wound repair has been confirmed by several workers.
