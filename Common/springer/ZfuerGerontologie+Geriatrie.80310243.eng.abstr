  The goal of this paper is to contribute to conceptual issues associated with the construct of everyday competence. After the description of reasons for the increased attention which everyday competence has found within gerontology, the first section of this work serves to shed light on six research traditions with relevance for everyday competence: (1) Research on everyday cognitive processes, (2) ADL/IADL research, (3) leisure time research, (4) coping research, (5) time budget research, and (6) ecological gerontology research. In the second section, two influential models of everyday competence, namely those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are discussed. Finally, an integrative conception of everyday competence, which is aimed to combine aspects of the six research traditions with elements of the two models of everyday competence, is suggested.
