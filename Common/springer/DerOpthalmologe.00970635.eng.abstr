Background. Sufficient and regular wetting of the cornea with a normal preocular tear film is an essential requirement for the accurate visual functioning of the eye. Multiple factors may cause tear film instability. Measuring the break-up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary, clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability. We designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break-up phenomena.
