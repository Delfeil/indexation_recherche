 The outcome in 163 patients treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the department for vascular and thoracic surgery since its institution 5 years ago is investigated. Some 142 patients underwent operative aneurysm repair; 21 (13%) were excluded from operation. In 108 (66%) an elective procedure was performed, an emergency operation for rupture 34 times (21%). In 16% of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted. For further analysis the patients were split in three groups: elective group 1, symptomatic group 2, ruptured group 3. Significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter, distribution of gender (128 M, 14 F), renal artery involvement, or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and the presence of multiple risk factors. Group 1 had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2; whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group 3 than in the other two groups. Sixty-four percent of patients had no, 11% had more than one complication. Mortality was 0 in groups 1 and 2, but 35.3% in group 3. The most frequent complication in groups 1 and 2 was pneumonia (13.9%) followed by cardiac complications (4.6%), and renal insufficiency (3.7%). In group 3 respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence (23.5%), followed by renal insufficiency (21%) and pneumonia (17.6%). No patient of the nonoperated group suffered an aneurysm rupture; aneurysm diameters, except one, did not increase during the follow-up period. Of the 130 operated and discharged patients 31 died; in no case was death related to the operative procedure. No important complications were observed during the follow-up of 37.2 +/- 17.9 months. Furthermore, the results are compared with those of the literature. Based on their observations the authors conclude that this retrospective quality check was rather awkward and involved giving partly incomplete data for lack of a prospective evaluation. Nevertheless, the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory.
