We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient with a Syme amputation of his left leg following diabetic gangrene of the foot. A  local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two  endoscopic debridements and lavage. Additionally, the patient received local antibiotics by the application of antibiotic collagenous fleece and antibiotic chains. This therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump.
