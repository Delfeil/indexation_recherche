This retrospective study presents the results of 41 patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the Staatliche Orthopädische Klinik of the LMU München in the time between 31.10.1979 and 31.10.1994. It could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures, due to their variety, hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a differanciated therapeutic procedure. Among the operation methods the K-wire stabilisaton with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i.e. in 24 cases. The K-wire without cerclage was used in two cases. Twelfe fractures were treated with AO-plate-osteosynthesis. Three fractures had to be treated by resection, as they produced two pseudarthrosis and one serious AC-arthrosis during the conservative therapy. 92,7% of the subjective results of the 41 checked up patients were good and very good. The clinical follow-up of 36 and the radiological follow-up of 33 patients revealed in 97% a good and very good outcome in the Boenisch-Score.
