Introduction: Perfluorocarbone liquids (PFCL) enable explantation of intraocular lenses (IOL) dislocated into the vitreous. Because of their relatively high specific weight, the IOL can be floated off the retina and repositioned in the anterior segment. If the IOL surface is affected by contact with PFCL is still unknown. We were interested in the extent of PFCL contact with different IOL materials, having in mind a repositioning of a dislocated IOL into the posterior chamber. We investigated the adherence of PFCL to different IOL surfaces.
