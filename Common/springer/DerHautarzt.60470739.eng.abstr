Human papillomaviruses induce benign or malignant epithelial proliferations in both skin or mucosa and are involved in the development of anogenital cancer. One can consider two approaches towards vaccine development: prevention of infection by prophylactic induction of virus neutralizing antibodies or therapeutic vaccination which would lead to regression of already existing lesions. Neutralizing antibodies are directed against 3-dimensional structures on intact virions. Such antibodies which are protective in model systems can be induced safely by DNA-free "virus-like-particles". These constructs are candidates for a prophylactic vaccine. A further approach to optimize the vaccination strategy concentrates on immunotherapy of precancerous or malignant lesions by induction of a specific cell-mediated immune response. Hypothetically the transforming papillomavirus proteins which are expressed in basal layers of the epidermis could be used as a therapeutic vaccine in the form of synthetic peptides.
