Anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in 163 patients. Lesions treated were located between T4 and L3, most frequently occuring at T12/L2. Operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure. 2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure. One positioning related pressure harm on the thoracodorsal nerve and one irritation of the L1 root at the entrance site were both transitory. Postoperative control by X-ray and CTscan showed correct positioning of the bone graft, as well as the fixation device in all patients. Our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method. Major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach, postoperative pain reduction, early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay.
