In the last few years our understanding of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) has enormously progressed. Molecular analysis has revealed that almost all cases of this disease are clonal B cell neoplasms, therefore the term Hodgkin's lymphoma instead of Hodgkin's disease is being proposed in the new WHO classification. Lymphocyte predominance HL (LPHL) differs in respect to morphology, immunophenotype and clinical features from the other forms of HL and represents its own distinct entity. In addition to morphologic features (nodularity, presence of L&H cells) the immunophenotype of tumor cells is most important in establishing a diagnosis of LPHL, and particularly in differentiating LPHL from the other forms of HL. The remaining forms of HL (nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, lymphocyte depletion) display a mostly identical antigen profile and similar clinical characteristics, they are therefore grouped together in the REAL classification under the heading of classical HL. Recent imunohistological analysis have revealed that one third of HL cases, which formerly were classified as LPHL, display the immunophenotype of classical HL. These cases are now considered to represent examples of classical HL and termed nodular lymphocyte rich classical HL. According to retrospective clinico-pathological analysis, the biological behaviour of this newly identified form of classical HL also differs from LPHL. Differences between classical HL and LPHL also occur on the molecular level. Thus LPHL often displays ongoing mutations of the immunoglobulin genes, and the tumor cells express immunoglobulin protein and transcripts, while these characteristics are absent in classical HL. Since peripheral B cells that do not express immunoglobulins die from apoptosis, these findings imply that the regulation of apoptosis is defective in Hodgkin and Sternberg Reed cells. Several laboratories are currently working intensely to clarify the defective apoptosis pathway in HL.
