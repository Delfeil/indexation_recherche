 Approaches for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia have two goals, namely to determine the presence of pneumonia as well as its causative pathogens. Traditional diagnostic measures such as clinical and radiographic criteria and qualitative cultures of tracheobronchial aspirates (TBAS) are associated with considerable limitations as regards sensitivity and particularly specificity. Therefore, patients are at risk to be "overtreated" with antibiotics. On the other hand, prolonged antibiotic treatment represents an important risk factor for pneumonia. The specificity of isolates in culture can be significantly improved by applying the quantitative culture technique. Bronchoscopic techniques to retrieve respiratory secretions (PSB, BAL with quantitative culture) have only marginally increased specificity as compared to quantitative cultures of TBAS. Morbidity and Mortality are not influenced by the techniques used for microbial investigation. Therefore, TBAS is useful as primary diagnostic measure. Bronchoscopic techniques may be applied individually and, therefore, should be established and available as well.
