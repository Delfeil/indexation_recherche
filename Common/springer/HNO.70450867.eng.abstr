Special coupling devices made of pure gold or titanium have been developed to connect a new implantable hearing aid transducer (Tübingen implant) to the ossicular chain. They allow piezotransducer probe-tip connection to the long process of the incus or the stapedial head. Similar to the design of conventional PORPs (partial ossicular replacement prostheses), the coupling devices can be fixed at the ossicular chain, e.g., with the eye loop of stapedial piston prostheses or the bell element of golden wire PORPs. A crimp technique allows connection between coupling device and transducer probe tip [5]. The main disadvantage in connecting the long process of the incus or the stapes having is to drill a dorsal tympanotomy in the posterior wall of the ear canal during surgery. The short distance between tympanotomy and N. facialis contains serious surgical risks. To avoid the risk of facial paralysis, Fredrickson's alternative coupling technique for the body of the incus is investigated in this paper [2]. In this case, the transducer probe tip will be positioned to the incus body and placed on its surface with controlled elastic displacement of the ossicular chain. The simple direct attachment of the probe-tip end on the surface of the incus, however, will not guarantee a stable long-term connection. Thus, by creating a conical, 0.5- to 0.7-mm-deep hole in the incus, the probe tip will be fitted much better. With a novel surgical Erbium-YAG laser this can be done in a contactless procedure. In this paper, first results of microsurgical laser applications with human temporal bones will be shown.
