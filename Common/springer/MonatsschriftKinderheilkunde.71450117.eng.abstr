The hyper-IgD syndrome is a very rare entity first described in 1984 by Van der Meer et al [11]. It typically presents with a history of recurrent febrile attacks over years with abdominal symptoms, arthralgia, cutaneous manifestations, chills and headache. The diagnosis is established by demonstrating a polyclonal increase in serum IgD during an episode. Therapeutical options have only been supportive. Almost all documented cases were reported in Europe, but until recently no case was known in Germany. We present an 8 year-old boy suffering from recurrent febrile attacks since his third month of life every two to three weeks. These episodes lasted a few days. Further leading symptoms are severe, the patient most affecting vomiting attacks, associated with headaches and a fugitive rash. A raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leucocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated values of IgA, IgE and IgD are observed during the episodes.
