 A 49 year old male developed cardiocirculatory arrest following laparoscopic surgery of an inguinal hernia. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was started. The primary ECG showed ventricular fibrillation, after defibrillation a tachyarrhythmia and a newly developed right bundle branch block were documented. In addition, ST-elevations were seen in the left precordial leads. After 20 min of CPR the circulation was reestablished with high doses of catecholamines. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a 7 mm pericardial effusion with mild impression of the right ventricular free wall. The patient underwent urgent heart catheterization for suspected pulmonary embolism (differential diagnosis: acute myocardial infarction). Pulmonary angiography demonstrated floating thrombi in the left main pulmonary artery, which could be fragmented using a pigtail catheter. Pulmonary angiography was followed by coronary angiography, which demonstrated a sharply interrupted left anterior descending artery (LAD), while the coronary arteries in general were found to be regular. The history, the morphology of the LAD-interruption, the concomitant pericardial effusion and the sternal and rib fractures were consistent with a type III coronary perforation in the classification of Sutton and Ellis. As contrast medium penetration into the pericardial space persisted after recanalization of the LAD, a 19 mm stent graft (Jostent) was used for closure. These grafts are constructed using a sandwich technique with an ultrathin layer of expandable polytetrafluorethylene being placed between two stents. After implantation of the stent graft no more contrast medium penetration was documented.
