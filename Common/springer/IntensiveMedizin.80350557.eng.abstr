 In recent years a multitude of reports has been published on the effects of various antiarrhythmic and non-antiarrhythmic drugs causing QT-intervall prolongation and thus triggering a characteristic form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes. These drugs included antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antifungals, prokinetics and various other substances which often cause QT-prolongation and torsades only in combination with other riskfactors such as hypokalaemia or bradycardia. Most of these substances block the delayed rectifier potassium channel in myocytes. In this review we summarized the current knowledge on electrophysiologic mechanisms, riskfactors, arrhythmogenic risk and therapy of the acquired long-QT syndrome.
