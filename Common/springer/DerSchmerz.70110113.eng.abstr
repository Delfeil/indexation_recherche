The authors demonstrate a way to treat meralgia paresthetica ("jeans disease") with acupuncture. Two patients with therapy-resistant chronic pain and paresthesia of the lateral thigh became free of symptoms quickly and remained under acupuncture therapy. Gynecological, vertebral and urological factors must be excluded before any kind of symptomatic therapy is begun. The advantages and disadvantages of acupuncture are discussed.
