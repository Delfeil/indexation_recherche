Introduction: Coronary arterty disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world. Although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography (SCA) is beyond dispute, the associated risk of an invasive approach, the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non-invasive techniques for coronary imaging. Intravenous coronary angiography (ICA) has been shown to permit non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.
