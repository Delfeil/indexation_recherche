To our knowledge no comparative studies investigating patients' acceptance of different MR systems have been published. We therefore studied a number of subjective criteria to evaluate both patients' acceptance of and subjective conditions during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. MRI studies were performed using four separate systems. Two were conventional body MR systems operating at 1.0 or 1.5 Tesla, another was a 0.2 Tesla open whole-body MR system, and the last was a 0.2 Tesla MR system dedicated to the study of extremities. Forty patients for each MR system (total of 160 patients) participated in a standardized, written interview focusing on aspects of their subjective condition, including their perception and acceptance of different factors relevant to the study on respective MR systems. The patients' subjective condition and acceptance was predominantly positive for all MR systems. Differences between MR systems were noted with respect to noise, width of patient gantry, comfort of patient positioning and degree of well-being. Such differences, however, do not lend preference to the use of one particular type of MR system. Therefore, the choice of MR system should be based on the technical features required for the intended studies.
