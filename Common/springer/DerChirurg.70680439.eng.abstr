All 1994 publications of four leading journals in surgery, orthopedics and internal medicine in Germany (Der Chirurg, Der Unfallchirurg, Langenbecks Archiv für Chirurgie, Medizinische Klinik) were reviewed by means of a structured analysis. The type of article, authorship, number of references, geographical location, quality, and main conclusion (positive; neutral; negative) of each article were documented. The journals focused on clinical studies (32.2-59.6 %), case reports (11.0-26.1 %) and reviews (6.4-40.9 %). Articles about surgical techniques were mainly found in Der Chirurg (16.9 %), experimental studies in Der Unfallchirurg (14.7 %) and Langenbecks Archiv für Chirurgie (25.7 %). Most articles were written by university clinic personnel (62.6-81.4 %). In 11.0-22.6 % of all articles, the head of a clinic was the first author and the co-author in 36.5-58.7 %. Women were found to be first author in 4 % in surgery, and in 10.4 % in internal medicine. Of a total of 495 publications, 53.9 % were written in Northrhine-Westphalia, Bavaria or Baden-Württemberg and only 1.6 % in the five new federal states. Of all articles 16.4 % were by foreign authors, with 10.5 % originating from German-speaking countries. The portion of controlled randomized trials ranged between 4.9 % (Der Unfallchirurg) and 11.3 % (Der Chirurg) of all published studies. Studies and case reports with negative results were found to be more evident in Der Chirurg and Langenbecks Archiv für Chirurgie (ca. 20 %) as compared to Der Unfallchirurg and Medizinische Klinik (ca. 6 %). All journals provided good general information about the actual developments in a variety of topics to the reader. However, some improvement concerning international contributions, participation of the new federal states, and the quality of studies is recommended.
