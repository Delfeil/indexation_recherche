An 82-year-old patient with untreated chronic lymphatic leukaemia known for 6 years developed large livid red plaques with central blisters and subsequent ulceration of the lower legs. Reactive angioendotheliomatosis was diagnosed based on histological immunohistological and electronmicroscopic examination, since proliferating endothelial cells with intravascular fibrin thrombi were identified. When the leukaemia was treated the skin eruption healed completely.
