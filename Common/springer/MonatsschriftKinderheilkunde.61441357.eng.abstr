Functional relaxation (FE), a somato-psychotherapeutic method, can reduce asthmatic symptoms. The efficiency of a 5 minute introduction of elements of functional relaxation (EFE) is compared with a placebo-relaxation-method not based on the hypothetical mechanisms of FE, and a standardised pharmacological bronchodilative test using salbutamol. In a controlled prospective randomised single blind setting 18 children and adolescents with acute asthma were treated on three consecutive days with each method. Before and ten minutes after therapy the patients had bodyplethysmographic pulmonary function testing. U-Tests showed that the baseline measurements were comparable. The before-after-comparison revealed significant changes for EFE and salbutamol, not for the placebo-relaxation. There were significant differences between the intraindividual differences of the airway resistance and the specific airway resistance between salbutamol and the placebo-relaxation, not between EFE and salbutamol or EFE and the placebo-relaxation. FE can be an effective complementary treatment in children or adolescents with asthma.
