Arthroscopic assisted treatment of intraarticular fractures of the knee was first reported in 1982 for fractures of the tibial eminence and in 1985 for fractures of the tibial plateau. Since then, publications on this subject deal only with occasional cases or with small series of less than 50 patients. In the meantime, arthroscopic treatment has proved to be ideally suited for several specific types of intraarticular fractures, including dislocated fractures of the intercondylar eminence, and unicondylar fractures of the tibial condyles with or without impression of the plateau. In fractures of the tibial eminence and in simple fractures of the tibial condyle, internal fixation with cannulated screws is recommended, possibly with washers, for pure impression elevation of the tibial plateau and filling of the defect with cancellous bone, and for impression combined with split fracture of the condyle bone grafting and additional screw fixation. Even more complicated fractures may be treated with arthroscopic assistance. The indication for this kind of treatment relies on the type of fracture and the experience of the surgeon. Additional internal fixation, i.e. with a butress plate, is necessary as a rule. In specific cases, osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyles and fractures of the patella can be treated arthroscopically. Arthroscopic fracture fixation has distinct advantages compared with the open procedure: Arthroscopy allows reliable diagnosis and therapy of concomitant intraarticular lesions, provides a better view of the joint surfaces and therefore enables a better reduction of the fracture. The minimal soft tissue injury results in a markedly decreased morbidity. Following intraarticular fractures, the removal of metallic implants as well as debridement in loose or broken-up joint cartilage and the resection of bony irregularities can be performed arthroscopically. Loss of extension in non-united or in healed but displaced fractures of the tibial eminence is an ideal indication for arthroscopic notch plasty. All published studies report good results. However, there is just one study with a control group treated by open operation, reporting only a small number of patients [25]. In this study, arthroscopic treatment is superior to open internal fixation. Up to now the proof is still missing that results of the arthroscopic procedure are better. This is especially true for the treatment of fractures of the tibial plateau. to minimise posttraumatic osteoarthritis.
