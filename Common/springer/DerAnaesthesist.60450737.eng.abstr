Several clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ropivacaine in different regional anaesthesia techniques, e.g., epidural anaesthesia. However, the efficacy of ropivacaine for spinal anaesthesia has only been demonstrated in animal experiments up to now. The objective of this study was the investigation of the efficacy and appropriate dosage of isobaric ropivacaine for spinal anaesthesia in humans.
