We report on a 12-year old boy suffering from malignant epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of the liver, which is a very rare tumor in childhood. The tumor was detected by ultrasound examination at the age of 10 and appeared at that time as a solitary intrahepatic nodular lesion. During the following 2 years multiple nodular lesions developed in both hepatic lobes. There were neither any suspect anamnestic findings nor abnormal clinical or laboratory data. The tumor showed the typical histomorphological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features of this entity, which is usually seen in older patients. We investigated proliferative activity, apoptotic regulation, and expression of VEGF and VEGF-receptor flk-1 by means of immunohistochemical techniques. According to the known slow growth activity of these tumors we found only a few Ki-67 positive tumor cells. We did not detect any apoptotic cells using TUNEL technique. The positive immunoreaction of the tumor cells with antibodies against VEGF and VEGF-receptor flk-1 may indicate the regulation of tumor growth by angiogenetic factors. We present our findings together with a summary of the most important publications of recent years concerning these tumors.
