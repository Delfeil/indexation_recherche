The history of Cowper Gland is described. Next the clinical, radiological and endoscopical findings in 172 patients (age 18 to 82) are evaluated with regard to the importance of these alterations in clinical practice. There was no tumor. In three cases, only the bulbourethral gland showed inflammation. Out of 169 syringoceles 9 were closed (3 perineal, 6 bulbar). Only one case of the urethral (bulbar) type of closed syringocele showed obstruction. There were 56 patients with various forms of dilatation and opening into the urethra. Only one case showed obstruction. Thirty-one out of 104 patients with so-called simple syringocele had mild dilatation of the duct, mainly normal gland and mild symptoms. Alterations of the urethral wall as well as clinical symptoms were noted in the remaining 73 men with irregular ducts and alterations of the gland; all of them had local urethral signs; in 42 there were extensive urethral strictures.
