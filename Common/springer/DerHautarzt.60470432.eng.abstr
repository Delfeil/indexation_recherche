A 72-years old man with Parkinson's disease was treated with levodopa for 14 years. A superficial spreading melanoma (Breslow depth 1,8 mm, Clark level IV) was diagnosed, developing on the back from a pigment lesion which had present for more than 10 years. Other case reports suggest a relationship between the administration of levodopa and the growth of malignant melanoma. On the other hand, epidemiological studies found no correlation. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown a possible anti-tumor effect of levodopa. Critical analysis of the literature leads to the conclusion, that there is no increased melanoma risk from levodopa.
