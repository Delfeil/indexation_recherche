A 53-year-old man presented a melanotic lung tumor which was based in the bronchus of the left lower lobe and closed the left main bronchus. After laser therapy, left lobectomy with sleeve resection was carried out. Complications after the surgery required resection of the rest of the left lung and thoracoplasty. Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma. There was no past history of an excision or a fulguration of a cutaneous, mucous membrane, or ocular lesion. Examination of the skin and the eyes did not yield any evidence of another primary tumor. We conclude that the lesion represents a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, a rare neoplasm of which only 21 cases have been confirmed. The patient does not have any evidence of tumor in the relatively short follow-up period of 10 months.
