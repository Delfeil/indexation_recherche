Fluorescence-in-situ-hybridisation (FISH) on uncultured amniocytes could be established in routine prenatal diagnostics successfully. Frequently occurring numeric aberrations (trisomies 13, 18, 21 and numeric gonosomal aneuploidies) can now be detected within 24 h. More than 3300 amniotic fluid samples could be analysed with this method. Because the complete karyotype is not analysable by FISH it can not be considered as a stand alone test. It can only be performed in combination with conventional karyotyping.
