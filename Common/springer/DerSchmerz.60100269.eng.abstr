 Besides the treatment of postoperative pain, working together with the anaesthesiologist, orthopaedic doctors are mostly involved in diseases of the locomotor system where pain is a leading feature. Painful orthopaedic diseases are very frequent. They afford a special diagnostic procedure. The pain treatment consists of special orthopaedic therapy and local injections with low doses of local anaesthetics and steroids at the site of pain. This treatment helps to avoid the use of high-dose systemic analgesics and perhaps avoids the need for operations.
