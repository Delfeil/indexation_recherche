 The prevalence of FM in the general population is estimated at 2%. FM is among the three most common diagnoses in ambulatory adult rheumatology practice. To study the degree of depression, the familial history of depression and FM, as well as the psychological distress in our FM population, we mailed a standardized questionnaire to 304 FM patients. The response rate was 33%. We found BDI scores higher than 21 in 27% of the patients indicating clinical relevant depression. The patients had high levels of global distress measured with the SCL-90-R as well as elevated scores in the subscales. Twenty three percent had a familial history of depression, 46% a familial history of FM, and 46% had been diagnosed with depression in the past.
