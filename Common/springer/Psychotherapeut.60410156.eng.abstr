A seminar for hospital physicians in management positions (Württembergische Verwaltungs- und Wirtschaftsakademie, Stuttgart) in October 1994 illustrated the immediate relevance of W. R. Bion's book Experiences in Groups and Other Papers, published in 1961. The aim of this article, recalling Bion's experiences in groups by presenting in seminar's leadership principles, is to show how these experiences can be applied to an understanding of the individual.
