Q-fever is an infection caused by coxiella burnetti. Whilst the acute form of the infection appears with uncharacteristic, influenca-like symptoms, the chronic form shows symptoms of endocarditis mostly in patients with congenital heart disease, valvular disorders, or during immunosupression. Our patient, a 7 year old boy with congenital heart defect, developed a large pericardial effusion associated with high antibody levels as observed in chronic Q-fever.
