Background: With the changes in the structure of education and society, in recent years also the medical habilitation (German postdoctoral lecturing qualification) has been called into question as an academic qualification. With this in mind, the aim of our study was to discover the current opinion of those who had successfully completed a habilitation on the prerequisites for a habilitation, the habilitation procedure and the status of a habilitation, and to document potential wishes for reform.
