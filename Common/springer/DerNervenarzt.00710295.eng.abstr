Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases that occur in relation to cancer. Supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune mechanism, specific antineuronal antibodies have sometimes been detected. The current possibilities for treatment are limited. A female patient, aged 57, suffering from a breast cancer, developed a severe paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and limbic encephalitis within a few weeks. It is possible that the impressive partial remission that occurred during the ensuing 6 months was not due to therapy. Although the patient was still bound to a wheelchair, discharge from hospital was possible because she was still able to perform daily tasks by herself. A recurrence of the cerebellar symptoms with mild alterations of mental status occurred 2 months later but again showed a good remission.
