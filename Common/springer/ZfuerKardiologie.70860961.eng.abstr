 Even in the era of coronary stenting, acute coronary artery occlusion continues to represent a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Despite application of heparin and aspirin, abrupt vessel closure still occurs in 2-8%, depending on the definition applied. Especially patients receiving PTCA for acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for abrupt vessel closure. The formation of an intracoronary thrombus plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abrupt vessel closure. Dipyridamole induces dilatation of coronary arteries and prevents platelet aggregation by a mechanism that differs from that of aspirin. The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adjunctive local intracoronary therapy with dipyridamole could reduce the incidence of coronary artery occlusion following PTCA. Secondary endpoints were defined as myocardial infarction, necessity for bypass grafting, and death.
