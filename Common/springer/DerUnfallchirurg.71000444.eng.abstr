We assessed knee joint proprioception in 23 patients with an isolated lesion of the medial meniscus. Thirteen patients were tested prior to their arthroscopic operation, and 10 patients were examined after partial arthroscopic resection of the injured meniscus. As a control group we evaluated 30 healthy volunteers with clinically inconspicious knee joints. For documentation of the proprioceptive capabilities we performed an angle reproduction test. Additionally the subjects were tested with and without an elastic knee bandage, to test the influence of such a bandage on knee joint proprioception. Our results showed that preoperatively proprioception was significantly less good than in the control group. We found no influence of the knee bandage on the proprioception of the injured knee. The postoperative group of patients showed significantly better proprioceptive capability than the preoperative patients. The postoperative results did not differ significantly from those of the control group.
