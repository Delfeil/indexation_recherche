Aim: Intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes Type I. Intensified insulin therapy includes an basis-bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, several times daily blood glucose self-monitoring, self-adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far-reaching liberalization of nutrition. The patients learn selfmanagement of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program. The effectivity of this program is evaluated in the routine care.
