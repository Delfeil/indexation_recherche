The gastrointestinal tract is the most common extranodal site for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) represents a specific entity and has to be differentiated from nodal lymphomas because of its different biological behaviour, prognosis and treatment. Imaging methods are important for detection and staging of PGIL. Gastrointestinal lymphomas produce a spectrum of pathological and radiological appearances. PGIL is encountered often enough to warrant familiary with the clinical, radiological and therapeutic options.
