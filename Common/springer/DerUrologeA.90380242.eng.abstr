We detected a special plastic, which is stable in an acid environment and dissolvable in a basic one. Our preliminary in-vitro results show that the tested material therefore seems principally designed for developing biodissolvable stents for temporary urinary diversion out of the upper urinary tract. Stableness and dissolution could be steered by manipulating the pH.
