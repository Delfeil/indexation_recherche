 Most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic. Besides the known effects of beta-blockers, among true antiarrhythmic drugs only amiodarone seemed to reduce total cardiac mortality in patients at risk.  Reevaluation of amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker in primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death after review of recent publications.  Only augmentation of case numbers by meta-analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality. However, the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases. This and specific side effects of amiodarone contradict a general primary prophylaxis with this drug. An additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta-blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies.  At present, primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations.
