Performed at the end of the mummification process, the "mouth-opening" ritual was a ceremony for the spiritual resurrection of the dead Pharaoh. The techniques used are astonishingly similar to modern emergency-room procedures. For example, the mouth-opening device was made of meteoric iron. In the Egypt of that time, the use of iron was very unusual and the higher levels of nickel in meteoric iron contributed to the stability of the instrument. There are other signs of medically sound methods in the mouth-opening ritual. Symbolically, the mummy's teeth were extracted, the eyes opened with a special device, and gold capsules inserted, perhaps in the sense of a breathing tube. There is a possibility that this ritual contains a forgotten synopsis of knowledge gained empirically in connection with the Egyptian cult of royal resurrection.
