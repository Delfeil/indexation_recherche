In the examination of reversible segmental (articular) hypomobile dysfunction (blockage) of the spine, we have to recognize by palpation the feeling of beginning resistance at the end of the passive movement ("barrier"). This is the main finding to diagnose segmental (articular) dysfunction. Normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end. In contrary, the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction, i. e. restriction of joint facet gliding.
