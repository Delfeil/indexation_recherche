In various laboratories the microbiological quality from water of 124 showers for eyes was investigated. Only 17.8% of the watersamples showed bacterial counts <100 CFU/ml. Over 104 CFU/ml were found in 39,5%. The optical assessment of the water revealed that only 49,2% watersamples were rated as "clear", whereas 20,2% showed high turbidity and intense precipitates. This study shows that such eye showers are problematic from the infectiological standpoint.Therefore it is proposed to use water from the water tap instead of showers for eyes.
