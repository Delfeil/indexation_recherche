With reference to current studies on emigration, which for Germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between 1933 and 1938, the immigration policy especially of the United States and Great Britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed. In this context, the major importance of the solidarity and help the refugees were granted by the international psychoanalytic community and performed in spite of partially major theoretical differences and institutional rivalries is emphasized.
