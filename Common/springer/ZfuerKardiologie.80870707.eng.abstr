  Background: Extensive coronary dissections are rare but represent serious complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In order to prevent dissections in large coronary vessels (>=2.5 mm), we evaluated stent implantation without predilatation in 98 selected patients with favorable coronary anatomy and lesion morphology.
