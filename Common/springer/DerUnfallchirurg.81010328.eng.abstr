The purpose of this paper is to outline the treatment protocol for the first time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocator, with options including conservative, arthroscopic and open surgical treatment. Regarding the subclassification of the first time traumatic anterior dislocater, it is imparitive to differentiate between the unidirectional dislocator with and without hyperlaxity. This subclassification takes into account the structural quality of the stabilizing ligamentous structures of the glenohumeral capsule. The patient with hyperelastic ligaments exhibit elastic deformation of the glenohumeral ligaments at the time of dislocation and thus, sustain less interstitial structural damage to the ligament. Therefore, these patients benefit from non-operative treatment.
