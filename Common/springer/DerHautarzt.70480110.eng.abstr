The healing of wounds by secondary  intention is a simple method to close  operative defects. The quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the  defect. Best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave  geometry and when the defect lies  symmetrically at the interface of two  anatomic subunits. Partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric  defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention. This simple and efficient operative procedure is ilustrated by two case reports.
