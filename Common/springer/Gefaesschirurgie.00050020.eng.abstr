 Seven patients, aged 61-85 years with symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenosis caused by arteriosclerosis, were treated with transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent, between 1 April 1996 and 30 June 1998. In one case, a thrombendarteriectomy of the external iliac artery with profundaplsty, in another, angioplasty with stent implantation of the common iliac artery was performed simultaneously. The procedures were technically and clinically successful in all cases. During a mean observation period of 23 months (minimum 7 months, maximum 33 months) no obstruction or clinical restenosis occurred. Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation in segmentary abdominal aortic stenosis represents a less invasive and safe technique with good long-term results.
