 In a porcine model, ten animals with a mean body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg were exposed either to intravenous boli of 10, 20, and 30 ml argon (n = 5) or CO2 gas (n = 5). Gas embolism with argon led to increased pulmonary artery pressure (P > 0.001) and induced a decrease in end tidal CO2 (P < 0.001) and reduced cardiac output (P < 0.001) with a consecutive decrease in mean arterial pressure (P < 0.05). One animal died in cardiac shock after a 20 ml argon gas embolism and another after a 30 ml argon bolus. A third animal recovered after resuscitation with noradrenaline after a 30 ml argon bolus. Animals in the CO2 group receiving 10, 20, or 30 ml bolus neither required resuscitation nor died. Hemodynamic parameters were not affected by a 10 to 30 ml bolus of CO2 gas. Thus, gases with a low solubility in blood like argon should not be used during procedures with an increased risk of gas embolism.
