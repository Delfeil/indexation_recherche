 An essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment (melanins). Toxicological studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration. As the available vocabulary for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the viewer, it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow objectivation of hair colour. The natural hair colour of 17 subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart (Wella, Darmstadt, Germany). Subsequently the colours of the hair and the samples of the hair colour chart used for comparison were measured by colorimetric analysis and the CIEL*a*b* values were determined. The descriptive categorisation of the hair colours (e.g. blonde, brown, black) could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results. Sometimes considerable differences were also found between the colour values of the natural hair samples and the specimens used for comparison. When the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible.
