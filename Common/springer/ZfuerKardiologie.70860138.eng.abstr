  Despite careful evaluation of multiple projections, coronary angiography may give ambiguous results of lesion severity.. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of ultrasound imaging on revascularization treatment strategy in angiographically ambiguous findings. We reviewed our experience with such equivocal angiographic findings before intervention in 31 patients (34 lesions) who had additional intravacular ultrasound (IVUS) to clarify coronary anatomy. Intervention was felt to be indicated if area stenosis by IVUS exceeded 50 % in the left main or 75 % in other major coronary arteries. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of IVUS based management strategies, all patients had clinical follow-up after 1 year.
