Persistent defects of the ocular surface remain a therapeutic challenge that often requires surgical intervention. Recently, the transplantation of human amniotic membrane has been added to our therapeutic armentarium. This thick basement membrane has distinct biological properties that influence cellular differentiation and proliferation. Amniotic membrane obtained from cesarean deliveries is prepared and cryopreserved under sterile conditions and can be sutured onto the ocular surface. This procedure allows for reepithelialization of persistent corneal ulcerations as well as filling of stromal defects. Amniotic membrane can successfully be employed for ocular surface reconstruction following large corneal excisions and in the context of limbal stem cell disease for pterygium surgery as well as for various kinds of reconstruction of the conjunctiva. Taken together, amniotic membrane transplantation can serve as a valuable tool for ocular surface reconstruction, especially in the context of impaired epithelial function.
