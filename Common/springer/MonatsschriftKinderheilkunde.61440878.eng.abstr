 Recurrent headaches and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) are the most common pain syndromes in childhood: The prevalence of tension headache amounts to 20-50 %, of migraine to 5-7 % and of RAP to 15-30 %. In nearly 50 % of children the complaints persist over many years of their life-span. The unfavourable long-term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions. Empirical findings on the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology are still very limited. Actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance, and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences. The behavioral-medicine proceeding bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis. The psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis (stress inoculation, cognitive redefinition, problem solving), reduction of pain symptoms (relaxation, distraction, imagination) and environmental modification (parental reinforcement and modeling behavior). During the last years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioral pain management programs for children.
