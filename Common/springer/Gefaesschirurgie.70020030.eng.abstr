 We present the case of a 31-year-old man with known Behçet disease. Abdominal pain led to the diagnosis of tandem aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Complete resection and interposition tube grafting were carried out. During the operation we found signs of inflammation of the terminal ileum in addition. Histologically the aortic wall showed a defect, loss of elastic fibres of the media and vasculitis of the vasa vasorum. The problems encountered in the diagnosis and treatment of arterial Behçet disease are discussed with reference to the literature. Possible surgical procedures are presented. Our patient was not treated with adjuvant immunosuppressive therapy, whose efficacy is in any case disputed, because of the intestinal involvement.
