Immediate breast reconstruction can now be offered to almost all patients who need a mastectomy. The single-pedicle TRAM-flap from the contralateral rectus abdominis muscle offers adequate volume and skin to replace that removed, and also good modelling capacity for symmetrical reconstruction of the breast shape. Experience of over 500 cases between 1984 and 1997 shows that the single-pedicle flap is as safe as the two-pedicle flap. The complication rate and the frequency with which revision operations were needed amounted to a total of 12.6 %. Immediate reconstruction following carcinoma extends the individual spectrum of treatment options with reference to primary treatment tailored to the tumour and is characterized by the decisive quality criterion of subsequent freedom from local recurrence.
