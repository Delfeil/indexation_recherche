 If one follows the concept of the "golden hour" in the treatment of myocardial infarction, it is not only a matter of intervention "as soon as possible" but also the attempt to remain in this critical time frame by gaining time. Also for patients, who alert the emergency medical system very early, this concept fails in practice, because the ambulance personnel often lack the quali-fications to recognise and treat patients with acute myocardial infarction early. With ECG transmission from the emergency location to the hospital and by wireless communication, this situation can be improved and critical time can be gained. The practical problems appear solvable. An acceptance for the process may, however only then be expected if the concept of a time frame for optimal treatment of myocardial infarction gains acceptance.
