 Synovitis (inflammatory arthritis), acne (pustulosa), pustulosis (psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis), hyperostosis (acquired), and ostitis (bland osteomyelitis) are symptoms forming the acronym SAPHO, which is a syndrome of nosologic heterogeneity. All entities forming the SAPHO syndrome are connected by a non-obligate dermato-skeletal association with an aseptic pustulous character.
