Neurogenic bladder dysfunction in childhood is mostly caused by spinal dysraphism. The urologic diagnostic procedure tries to evaluate the underlying form of neurogenic bladder, dysfunction the associated disturbances at the upper tract and the development of changes by body growth. Therapeutic main aim is the conservation and protection of the kidney function and, secondly, the development of social dryness and a form of bladder emptying, that is related to the individual situation and associated disabilities. We report here about the diagnostic procedure and result of a group of 190 patients, that have been seen in our department since birth and for more than ten years continously. Developmental changes of neurogenic bladder dysfunction has been found in more than 25 % of the children. This figure shows the need of lofe-long close urodynamic follow-up.
