 Objective: To evaluate the performance of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPSII) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Background: Scores are used to describe and stratify groups of critically ill patients according to severity of disease and prognosis. Coronary care patients were excluded from the developmental and validation samples of the original score. Therefore, discrimination and calibration of SAPS II have to be evaluated in this group of patients. Methods: SAPSII, risk of death, and outcome of hospital treatment (surviving, dead) were recorded in all 592 patients with AMI treated in the ICU of our community teaching hospitel since routine implementation of SAPSII. ROC curves and area under curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate discrimination power. A formal goodness-of-fit test was performed and a calibration curve calculated to evaluate calibration. Results: In 592 pat. with AMI, the mean age was 65.8 +/- 12.6 y, SAPSII 30.7 +/- 17.1, risk of death, median 6.4% (25; 75% percentile 2.7%; 14.8%), mortality in the ICU 10.3%, hospital mortality 14.5%. Standardized mortality index was 0.89 (0.77- 1.05; 99% confidence intervall). The AUC of ROC for risk of death was 0.868 +/- 0.021. Chi2 was 13.15 and the P value 0.2 for the goodness-of-fit test. The calibration curve showed no significant deviation from the line of identity. The higher hospital mortality of females (19.2 versus 12.4 in men) was in accordance with a higher SAPSII score and a higher risk of death, which is mainly explained by the higher age of females with AMI. Conclusion: SAPS had a strong discrimination power and a satisfactory calibration performance in patients with AMI. SAPSII can be applied to groups of ICU patients with AMI.
