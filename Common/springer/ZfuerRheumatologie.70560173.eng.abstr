 Autologous and allogeneic blood or marrow transplants are currently under intensive discussion as therapeutic option for patients with severe autoimmune disorders. Preclinical data as well as case reports from patients with transplants for other indications and concommitant autoimmune disorders support such concepts. In order to advance in a coordinated way the European League against Rheumatism EULAR and the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation EBMT prepared common guide lines on how to proceed. They are presented and summarised. Clear clinical data are still missing. Preliminary data are promising and protocols for prospective studies are being prepared. They should allow a better evaluation of the procedures in a few years from now.
