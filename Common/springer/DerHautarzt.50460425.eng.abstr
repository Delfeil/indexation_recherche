Idiopathic middermal elastolysis (IMDE) is a rare disorder with two different clinical presentations: type I lesions, with tiny wrinkles along skin cleavage lines in large confluent areas, and type II lesions, with small perifollicular papular protrusions. The histopathological picture is characteristic. IMDE is mainly seen in healthy young or middle-aged women. We describe a 60-year-old male patient with this disorder. The special interest of this case report is that there was no photosensitivity and no exacerbation with PUV therapy. IMDE is probably a special sort of elastolytic disorder, for which immunologic mechanisms seem possible.
