Diagnostic tools for the studies of mitochondrial disorders of energy metabolism such as biochemical and molecular genetic techniques, have increased our knowledge on the clinical spectrum of mitochondrial cytopathies (MC) and have enabled new insights in the etiology and pathogenesis of these heterogeneous multisystem disorders. In contrast, the therapeutical influence on the usually progressive clinical courses are very limited. A causal therapy has to take into account that biochemical defects are heterogeneous (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvate carboxylase, respiratory chain complexes), frequently show tissue-specific and/or time-depending expression and may occur in combination with each other. To this date the following therapeutical principals have been used: (1) decrease of the endogenic generation of toxic intermediates (by dietary measures); (2) increase of residual enzymatic activities (by enzyme cofactors or activators); (3) bridging the enzyme defects (by electron acceptors/donators); and (4) antioxidative and membrane-protective measures. This review presents the mechanisms of agents used so far, and discusses their therapeutical effectiveness according to the data from the literature and our experience with 26 patients suffering from different types of MC. It is shown that patients with pure myopathic manifestations of complex I deficiency as well as cardiomyopathy caused by carnitine depletion exhibit the greatest benefit from cofactor supplementation. The clinical course of patients with Kearns-Sayre syndrome may be influenced by various therapeutical procedures. In patients with diseases showing a predominantly encephalopathic presentation (like Leigh syndrome), disturbed lactate/pyruvate metabolism tends to normalise under treatment. The therapeutical influence on the clinical course however, is at best limited to temporary improvement or delaying progression. Nevertheless, effects of any particular therapy can not be predicted easily in any individual at any stage of the disease. Thus, therapeutical trials are justified because of the low rate of side effects. Gene therapeutical strategies hopefully will offer more effective treatments.
