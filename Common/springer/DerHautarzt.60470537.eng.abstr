Two children developed multiple melanocytic naevi after polychemotherapy administered for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in one and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the other. Induction of naevi does not seem to be related to specific agents used in chemotherapy, but rather to the immunosuppression resulting from multiple-agent chemotherapy. There are reports in the literature of both intrinsically and iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients who have developed multiple melanocytic naevi.
