S-Ropivacaine is a new, long-acting amide local anaesthetic. It is the first local anaesthetic to be on the market as a single isomer. Its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile is similar to that of bupivacaine. In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown ropivacaine to be less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine. When given epidurally, both local anaesthetics are equally effective in producing sensory block, but motor block seems to be less pronounced in the case of ropivacaine.
