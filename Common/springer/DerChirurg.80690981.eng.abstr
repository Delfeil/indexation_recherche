 A granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus. We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient, who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy. In the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found. Repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis, although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded. After indicating the operative therapy, the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach. The histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus (tumor of Abrikossoff). Since the tumor grade was unknown, our therapy seemed to be justified because of the low risk involved in minimally invasive operative procedures. There has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject, including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime, with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment. The case is discussed with a review of the literature.
