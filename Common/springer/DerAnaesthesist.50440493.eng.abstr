Pulse contour cardiac output (PCCO) is an easily applicable method for continuous measurement of cardiac output in critically ill patients. Calculation of stroke volume is possible by analysing the area under the systolic part of the arterial pulse pressure waveform together with an individual calibration factor (Zao) to account for the individually variable vascular impedance. Since vascular impedance is potentially affected by altered vascular tone, it was the aim of the present study to examine the validity of PCCO in ICU patients receiving various dosages of a variety of vasoactive drugs.
