Background: Hyperhomocysteinemia has been increasingly recognized as an important risk factor for elevated atherosclerotic vascular disease in chronic renal failure. We measured in patients with chronic renal failure homocysteine and metabolites of it s 2 metabolic pathways, transulfuration (cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation (methionine, methylmalonic acid, 2-methylcitric acid).
