Abstract.  There is a wide range of alternatives for primary bone reconstruction in the treatment of open lower leg fractures with soft tissue damage of the type Gustillo II and III. The primary objective should always be the protection of soft tissue damage whether one uses the fixateur externe, or an unreamed nail or primary bone shortening with secondary callus distraction. In recent years, this approach has produced better results and a reduction in the rate of major amputations. The overall effects of the initial treatment can only be analysed after a number of years. Research results indicate long-term soft tissue complications of the lower leg, varying from harmless swelling to venous ulcer. We conducted a clinical investigation which compared 80 patients, who were treated between 1985 and 1994 using the venous-occlusion plethysmography, to 50 healthy individuals. Clinically significant damage of the deep venous system was found in over 50 % of cases. There was a direct correlation between the number of years since the initial treatment and the degree of damage found. Based on these findings, we recommend that the initial treatment of this condition and the preventative treatment of the secondary trauma diseases should follow regulated surgical guidelines and be recognised for insurance purposes.
