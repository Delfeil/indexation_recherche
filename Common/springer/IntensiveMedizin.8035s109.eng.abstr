  Liver function is closely related to hemostasis due to the fact that almost all components participating in clotting and fibrinolysis are synthesized in liver parenchymal cells and the liver's reticuloendothelial cell system participates in the regulation of hemostasis. Advanced liver function defects result in signs of decreased synthesis of hemostasis-related proteins and increased turnover of coagulation and fibrinolysis. A labile balance in hemostasis usually results without any requirement to correct clinically asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities. Clinically the decompensation of hemostasis in liver diseases due to different noxious agents results more often in bleeding with more or less pronounced laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, consumption coagulopathy or hyperfibrinolysis and only rarely in overt thromboembolism.
