For routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children, sonography, voiding cystogram, IV pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available. Furthermore, often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed. However, the significance of retrograde ureteropyelography in the world literature remains controversial. Therefore, we reviewed the records of 41 children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department. In 9 children the ureter was visualized by IV pyelogram, voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography; a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in 21 children before pyeloplasty in the OR. In 11 children the ureter was not visualized preoperatively. Retrograde ureterography neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique. In the children where the ureter was not visualized preoperatively, no ureteric abnormality was found in association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Hence, we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary, provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation.
