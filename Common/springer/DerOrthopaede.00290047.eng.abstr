The introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections. Lengthening and shortening is achieved by changing the length of the fixator telescope. Axial corrections are performed by additive or subtractive techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures. Translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal "double angulation". Derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the "ring part" of a hybrid frame. Unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the nintramedullary nail.
