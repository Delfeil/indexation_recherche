Functional recovery after bilateral comminuted fractures of the humeral head with posterior dislocation is poor. When reposition and internal fixation fail, the remaining alternatives are (hemi)arthroplasty and/or arthrodesis. In a 50-year-old patient, we treated the dominant shoulder by arthrodesis; a Neer prosthesis was inserted at the other side. Using this strategy, the advantages of both techniques were combined with an acceptable functional recovery, which ist especially important for young and active patients.
