  Hyperlipidemia is an important factor in the development of graft vessel disease after heart transplantation. In our hospital the H.E.L.P. system (Heparin-mediated extracorporal LDL precipitation) was applied in heart transplanted patients with hypercholesterolemia for the first time. Indications were plasma cholesterol concentrations above 240 mg/dl and LDL-cholesterol concentrations above 135 mg/dl, respectively, in spite of cholesterol diet and maximal lipid lowering medication (15 mg Simvastatin/day). 723 treatments were performed in 13 patients. They were divided into two groups. Patients of group 1 (n=10) showed regular coronary angiography, whereas patients of group 2 (n=3) already revealed signs of graft vessel disease at the time of the first H.E.L.P. treatment. In the control angiographies performed once a year after H.E.L.P. was started, eight out of ten of the patients of group 1 showed no graft vessel disease, while only two out of ten developed graft vessel disease despite of H.E.L.P. therapy. In group 2, two patients indicated a regression of preexisting angiopathy, the third patient, however, revealed further progression of coronary stenoses. Patients of both groups, who revealed no development of progression of graft vessel disease showed continously low blood levels of LDL, Lp (a), and fibrinogen in the interval between two treatments. In contrast, in cases of pogressive angiopathy, a continous decrease of Lp (a) and fibrinogen could not be achieved with the H.E.L.P. apheresis.
