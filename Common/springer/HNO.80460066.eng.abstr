We report the rare development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma involving the minor salivary glands in the buccal mucosa of a 78-year-old female. Tumor presented as a small asymptomatic left buccal mass. The initial dominant component of the neoplasm was a pleomorphic adenoma, while the minor component was a myoepithelial carcinoma. Recurrences of tumor after 2 and then 5 years were excised. Histopathological examination of the last tissue removed showed a pure myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands without evidence for a pleomorphic adenoma. The clinical features, therapy, diagnosis, histopathology and literature are reviewed.
