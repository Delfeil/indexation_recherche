 We present a case of a young man with an extensive mediastinal tumor and the unexpected histopathological diagnosis of allergic granulomatosis and angiitis (AGA, Churg-Strauss-syndrome). A 24-year old man was admitted to our hospital due to a massive mediastinal tumor which was already infiltrating the middle and the upper lobe of the right lung, the thymus, and the pericardial sac. The most likely diagnosis at CT was thymus carcinoma. For that diagnosis the en-bloc resection of the thymus and the middle lobe was performed and completed by a mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Parts of the upper lobe of the right lung and a 15x10cm part of the pericardial sac needed to be resected as well.  The definitive histopathological result did not confirm a malignant process. After extensive immunhistochemical and molecular pathological investigations the most likely diagnosis was allergic granulomatosis associated with angiitis. Further investigations led to the diagnosis of an atypical Churg-Strauss syndrome. The problems with the clinical, histological, and immunhistochemical diagnosis are discussed and the rare conditions of the disease represented.
