  Hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure. There are a few reports of hypocalcemic children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism. In all these patients, however, cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years. In addition, other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism, e.g., convulsive seizures, had been present prior to cardiac symptoms.
