 The indications, operative procedure, postoperative complications and advantages of laparoscopic ileostomy and colostomy as compared with "open" enterostomy are described and demonstrated in our own patients with Crohn's disease. Major indications for laparoscopic enterostomy in patients with Crohn's disease are stenosis, fecal incontinence and complex anal fistulas in those with severe Crohn's proctitis. Most Crohn patients tolerate laparoscopic enterostomy and an increasing number demand this minimally invasive technique. The period of convalescence is much shorter and complications in connection with laparotomy are minimized.
