Instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis and will mostly be found after motor vehicle accidents or sports injuries. Depending on the severity of the trauma open reduction is rarely required, and most cases will be treated successfully with conservative management. Associated injuries to the surrounding anatomic structures are not rare, and can be found in posteriorly directed injuries.
