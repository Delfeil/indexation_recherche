Aim: To investigate the distribution of Laminin in experimental microvascular surgery. Material and methods: Autografts (4 mm) of the left common carotid artery in 20 Wistar rats were harvested after 4 weeks. The specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of Laminin. Results: The demonstration and distribution pattern of Laminin was a function of the accuracy of each single suture. In the intima, the organisation and amount of Laminin was directed to the lumen and dependent from the distance and vitality of the vessel segments' cells. The media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potency to regenerate the continuity break. The adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis, which was circularly grown through with Laminin-positive vasa vasorum. The marked myointimal hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was constituted of Laminin-positive extracellular matrix. Conclusions: Our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery.
