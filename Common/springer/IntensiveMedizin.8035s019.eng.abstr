  Hemodynamic monitoring of the critically ill patient with pulmonary artery catheterization has been followed by controversy through the decades although most clinicians believe that the catheter is useful in diagnosis and treatment of a variety of clinical conditions. Its ability to measure important hemodynamic indices allows more accurate determination of the hemodynamic status of critically ill patients and, furthermore, a modification of treatment modalities (e.g., volume therapy, therapy with vasoactive substances). Moreover, evidence exists that right heart catheterization may fail to improve outcomes in some circumstances and maybe associated with an increased risk of death. The ultimate effectiveness of invasive hemodynamic monitoring in terms of outcome remains uncertain, for lack of properly designed clinical trials. Therefore, appropriate indications for pulmonary artery catheter monitoring according to recommendations of a recent consensus conference are mainly based upon expert opinions. Consistent with this expert panel and other medical societies a moratorium on the use of pulmonary artery catheters is not warranted. Randomized, controlled trials of pulmonary artery catheters should be conducted to further define the effectiveness of this type of intervention. Clinicians' knowledge about the use of the pulmonary artery catheter and its complications as well as current training should be improved.
