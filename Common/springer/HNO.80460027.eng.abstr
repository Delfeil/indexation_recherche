Development and short-term implantation results of the Tübingen implantable hearing aid (TI=Tübingen implant) have been presented [12, 24, 25]. The TI is designed for patients with sensorineural hearing loss due to a malfunction of the cochlear amplifier. This can be identified by the presence of positive recruitment and the absence of TEOAE (transitory evoked otoacoustic emissions). The Tübingen implant functions in two ways: it allows electronic amplification of the auditory signal and electromechanical signal transduction into a micromechanical vibratory stimulus. There are two paths by which vibratory stimulus reaches the cochlea: (1) directly through a perforation in the stapes foot plate into the perilymph or (2) via the ossicular chain.
