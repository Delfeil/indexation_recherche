 The aim of the study was to evaluate the patency of coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) with the 2D and 3D magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques. 29 patients with 74 bypass grafts and a total of 91 distal anastomoses were studied on a 1.5 Tesla scanner using a phased array body coil. A 2D T-2 weighted breathhold turbo spin echo sequence (Haste) and a 3D breath hold contrast enhanced MR angiography sequence (Fisp-3-D) were performed. With the Haste and Fisp-3-D sequences 55 of the 58 patent and 15 of the 16 occluded grafts were recognized; the sensitivity and specifity were 95% and 94%, respectively. With the Haste sequence 74% (47/63) and with the Fisp-3-D sequence 64% (40/63) of the distal anastomoses were seen in good image quality. Only 3 of 8 significant grafts stenoses were detected.
