According to the EU Regulation on Novel Foods and Novel Food Ingredients, novel foods have to be as safe for the consumer as comparable conventional products. In order to ensure this, they are subjected to a health evaluation, which is performed on a case- by-case basis according to the principle of substantial equivalence, before they are placed on the market. For this purpose, information concerning toxicity, allergenicity and nutritional aspects is needed and in the individual case the requirements depend on the nature of the food as well as on the potential exposure to the consumer.
