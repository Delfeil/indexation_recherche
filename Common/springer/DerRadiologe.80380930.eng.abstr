Within certain limits the vascularity of cerebral gliomas correlates with dysplasia. Xenon CT and perfusion MRI can be used to investigate tumor vascularity. Using an optimized wash in/out protocol with inhalation of 30% xenon gas, xenon CT was performed and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and blood/tissue partition coefficient () calculated. Furthermore, perfusion MRI was performed using a dynamic T2*w EPI sequence with intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA. The relative regional cerebral blood volume, arrival time, time to peak and mean transit time were calculated. Both modalities were used in patients with supratentorial gliomas and compared with conventional contrast-enhanced MRI (ceMRI). Calculation of regional cerebral blood flow, as compared to ceMRI, did not contribute to the diagnostic approach of tumor dysplasia. Tumour vascularity was better estimated by measurement of . Measurement of relative regional cerebral blood volume also correlated with tumor vascularity. Mainly the possibility of direct quantification of the Xe-CT data was advantagenous compared to perfusion MRI, and the XeCT data could be interpreted more clearly. Further upgrades of the technical equipment of MR as well as upgrades of available software will increase the applicability of perfusion MRI. However, both modalities offer a more precise investigation of tumor vascularization compared to ceMRI since potential dysplastic alteration may be detected earlier, which will be advantageous for planning bioptical approach of such tumours.
