The IfSG will facilitate notifications for medical practitioners and doctors in hospitals, laboratories and institutes of pathology. According to the IfSG doctors treating patients have to consider only 18 instead of 40 notifiable communicable diseases whose majority will be acute viral hepatitis, measles and tuberculosis.  Doctors in laboratories have to consider as new notifiable pathogens only adenovirus in conjunctival smears, measles virus and Legionella sp. In the local health offices the handling of case definitions, collection of more variables per case and electronic data-processing has to be learned. These new tools are indispensable to achieve better quality of data in order to reach better descriptive epidemiology and targeted interventions.  Last but not least notifying doctors themselves and public health institutions will derive benefit from this. Doctors will accept their obligation to notify communicable diseases only if they receive timely and regularly qualified and interesting feedback.
