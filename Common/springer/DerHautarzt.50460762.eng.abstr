During the past decade more than 90% of all melanoma patients in the German-speaking countries have been diagnosed with a primary tumour alone. Therefore, surgical intervention has been the most important element in the management of these patients. The present investigation was performed to analyse the different surgical procedures used in the treatment of primary melanoma during the years 1983-1993. The primary treatment of 15,054 patients with malignant melanoma and without recognizable metastasis has been examined. During the time period under investigation the percentage of cases treated with two-step surgical management increased from 30% to 60%. Primary excision was performed in local anaesthesia in 40% of all patients in 1983, whereas in 1993 surgical intervention under local anaesthesia had increased up to 80%. Over the same time, the average safety margin decreased from 33 mm to 21 mm for the final excision of primary melanomas, and this decrease was paralleled by marked decrease in the average thickness of the tumours excised from 2.1 to 1.5 mm. Elective node dissection was performed in 5% of all patients in 1983, whereas 9% of patients underwent elective node dissection in 1993. The different centres participating were found to differ noticeably in the therapeutic procedures applied for similar indications. In conclusion, the management of primary malignant melanoma has changed considerably during the years 1983-1993 in the German speaking area in favour of a two-step surgical procedure, local anaesthesia for the excision of the primary tumour and smaller safety margins. It seems that earlier diagnosis of the tumour and also ideas about treatment design may be responsible for these changes.
