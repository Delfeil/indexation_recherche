Four children, 4 to 10 years old, with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA; starting dosage 2 mg/kg per day) and prednisolone. All children had previously received systemic steroids and/or cytotoxic agents, which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects. In one child, suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved. In a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function, although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage. In the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation. During the time of treatment, ranging from 11 to 26 months, no serious side effects were observed. All patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia. In our <\d> experience, cyclosporin A (CsA) combined with low-dose systemic steroids is useful as a therapeutic alternative to steroids alone and to other immunosuppressive agents in severe cases of chronic uveitis in childhood.
