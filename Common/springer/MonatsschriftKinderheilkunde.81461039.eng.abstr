A child who suffered from primary sclerosing cholangitis presented with severe portal hypertension over years. At age eleven, symptoms of right ventricular decompensation were noted. After stabilization, orthotopic liver transplantation was performed and resulted in severe decompensation with an increase of right ventricular pressure up to 95 mmHg. At further investigation, primary pulmonary hypertension with plexiform pulmonary arteriopathy was diagnosed. After ten months under oxygen and nifedipine treatment, the patient reached a stable cardiopulmonary state comparable to the pre-transplant period (right ventricular pressure 45 mmHg) but did not improve further.
