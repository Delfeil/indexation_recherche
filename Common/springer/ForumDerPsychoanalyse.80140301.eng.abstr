 This essay protests in the course of the discussions about § 174c StGB that in the meantime came to effect, against a general penalization of sexual contacts in the context of psychotherapy. On the basis of the "chronique scandaleuse" of Krutzenbichler and Essers it is showed, that since the beginnings of psychoanalysis up till today there occurred repeatedly such "incidents in analysis". A case study helps to show, that the harm of intimate contacts has to be considered with great differentiation. The article's conclusion is a "psychoanalysis of the analytical situation": instead of calling for the legislative psychoanalysts should recognize and analyse the problem as an inherent one rooted in the construction of the psychoanalytic situation itself.
