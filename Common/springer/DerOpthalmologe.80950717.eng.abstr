Background: The recommendations of the German Society of Ophthalmology (DOG) concerning the examination of candidates or holders of a driving licence allow a maximum time interval of 1 s for identifying a single Landolt-C for normal individuals as well as for patients with nystagmus. The aim of this study was to determine whether visual acuity decreases with shortening of the exposure time.
