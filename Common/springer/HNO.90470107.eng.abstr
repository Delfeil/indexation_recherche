Otorrhea is the most common complication after tympanostomy tube insertions. In Germany there are currently two commonly used types of tympanostomy tubes: silicon tubes (ST) and gilded silver tubes (GT). Previously published in vitro studies by Tajima uncovered a positive correlation between the silicon concentration in culture fluid and the rate of growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Our study retrospectively evaluates the types of bacteria and rates of otorrhea after ST and GT insertions. The present study was undertaken to determine which of these tubes had a higher incidence of otorrhea and then whether silicon tubes stimulated the growth of certain types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. In all, 186 ST and 59 GT were placed in 245 ears of 144 children. Both ST and GT were separated into three groups: first insertion of a tympanostomy tube, second implantation and insertion of a tympanostomy tube in an infected ear in the course of a mastoidectomy. No differences between ST and GT in causing otorrhea were found in the three groups. Nevertheless, ST in comparison to GT was associated with a higher incidence of infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In contrast, a higher incidence of Staphylococcus aureus related to ST could not be proved. Twenty percent of the ears with mastoiditis were found to have Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but none of these ears implanted with a GT developed postoperative otorrhea. Our findings show that GT should be used when a ventilation tube is used during a mastoidectomy. Further, it is tenable to implant only GT because postoperative otorrhea in many cases is caused by insufficient water protection and water isfrequently polluted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
