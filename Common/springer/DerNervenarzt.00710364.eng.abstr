Due to legal regulations, external quality assurance is mandatory in Germany. Supported by the German Health Ministry (BMG),we present the results of a multicenter study in four hospitals with different structures on 1042 inpatients with the trace diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD 10). We defined disease-specific indicators of structure, process, and outcome quality, developed an assessment instrument, and implemented a feedback system for quality comparison. The resulting quality profiles are useful as a starting point for internal quality management.
