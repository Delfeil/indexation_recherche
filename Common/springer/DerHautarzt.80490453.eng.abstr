A judgement on the patient's quality of life cannot be based solely on the information about the clinical severity of a disease. Very often there is no correlation between these parameters. It is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question-naire since non-life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much. The most frequently used questionnaires are the SF-36 and the Nottingham Health Profile. However, these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately. Therefore specific tools such as the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) and Skindex have been established for dermatology. Further disease-specific questionnaires have been created to mea-sure time related changes in dermatological patients.
