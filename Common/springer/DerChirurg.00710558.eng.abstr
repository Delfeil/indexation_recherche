Abstract.  We report on our experience with Integra application in 22 patients treated from February 1996 through April 1999. Nine patients suffered a primary burn injury and 13 patients had secondary unstable scars. Integra is artificial skin that consists of a collagen/glycosaminoglycane matrix and a silicon layer. It was first used by Burke and Yannas in 1980 in the USA. The mechanical and biological features of Integra protect the tissue from fluid loss and bacterial invasion in the acutely burned patient. The integra-induced formation of a neodermis leads to functionally and aesthetically highly acceptable scar formation. We present our clinical experience with Integra in long-term follow-up.
