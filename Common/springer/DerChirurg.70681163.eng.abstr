 The concept of emergency free tissue transfer for severe extremity injuries represents a cutting-edge technology. We discuss our very positive results with this technique. The conceptual reasons for these favorable results, compared with conventional approaches, are also discussed. An initial, radical debridement is the most important part of the operation. This is then followed by osteosynthesis. The correct type of free tissue transfer is chosen according to the requirements of the soft tissue defect. Qualitatively better results with earlier definitive rehabilitation were achieved with free tissue transfer performed during the acute stage of limb wound treatment. The follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 8 years. We experienced neither flap loss, osteomyelitis, nor severe wound infection. Using the modern concept of emergency free tissue transfer, we reduced the rate of flap loss and associated morbidity while achieving a functionally improved reconstruction.
