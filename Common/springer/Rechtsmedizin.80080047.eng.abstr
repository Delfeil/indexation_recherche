 Hair samples and perspiration collected from long term drug addicts (n = 18) under constant methadone treatment were investigated. Hair segments representing the individual hair growth of 4 weeks were analyzed for methadone, opiates and cocaine by GC/MS. The results obtained from the transdermal collection devices confirmed the presence of drug substances in variable amounts on the skin surface, methadone being the main analyte. The perspiration test period lasted for 4 days. For six persons illicit drugs similar to those in the corresponding hair samples were found. Overall, a poor relationship (r = 0,602) was found between the methadone dose under steady state conditions and the methadone level in hair. The results are discussed in the light of pharmacokinetic aspects, drug uptake by perspiration and forensic interpretation.
