Background and Objective. The clinical differentiation of the hereditary ichthyosis forms is difficult and without laboratory markers hardly possible. Serum lipoprotein electrophoresis is one tool for detecting patients with recessive X-linked ichthyosis (XRI). Compared to controls, XRI patients show elevated electrophoretic mobilities of low density (LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). This change in pattern is only partially explained by the increased LDL cholesterin sulfate concentration and is the subject of this study.
