Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used frequently in the diagnosis of knee injuries. The aim of this study was to compare the accruracy of MRI and clinical examination in diagnosing meniscal and cruciate ligament tears. Between January 1997 and June 1998, a total of 883 patients had undergone knee joint arthroscopy, operated on by one orthopedic surgeon. Of these, 144 patients had a preoperative MRI (group 1). This group was compared with 309 patients who had undergone arthroscopy without MRI between January 1997 and June 1997 (group 2). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for tears of the medial meniscus were 80.6%/58.8%/72.9% in group 1 and 83.3%/78.5%/80.3% in group 2, respectively, for tears of the lateral meniscus 44.4%/88.9%/83.3% in group 1 and 60.6%/98.8%/92.5% in group 2 and for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament 58.1%/92.0%/84.7% in group 1 and 80.1%/96.6%/89.6% in group 2. This study demonstrates that an experienced orthopedic surgeon can rely on the clinical diagnosis and decide whether arthroscopy is necessary in most cases without MRI. He will find intraarticular pathology in almost all cases if arthroscopy is performed. MRI should be reserved for special cases and should not be performed without first conducting a thorough clinical examination. The orthopedic surgeon should decide whether MRI is needed.
