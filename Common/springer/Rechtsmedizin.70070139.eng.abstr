 Generalised and intrathoracic petechiae (IP) and those restricted to the head occur in a large number of diseases and traumas. IP however are detected in cases of sudden infant death considerably more frequently than for other causes of infant death. They are not associated with gender in cases of sudden infant death, they are not dependent upon hypostatis, are not caused by attempts at resuscitation, have a typical frequency of occurrence and density, and they are a useful diagnostic criterion. The fact that they are missing in some cases of SIDS supports the hypothesis of a non-uniform pathogenesis. According to data from animal studies, they seem to develop as a result of increased breathing intensity with protracted hypoxia and an intact blood circulation. Promoting factors are infections, an increased concentration of catecholamines and a negative intrathoracic pressure. Only few investigations have investigated the frequency of occurrence of subconjunctival petechiae (SP) in infants. Results show that SP are atypical for SIDS, and they should always give cause for a more detailed examination, particularly when they appear in a high density. In contrast to cases of strangulation, where apart from a few exceptions SP can be detected, they are not found in the majority of cases of smothering by soft materials.
