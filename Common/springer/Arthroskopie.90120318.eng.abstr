Displacement of the discus articularis with and without repositioning represents a common pathological alteration of the temporomandibular joint (tmj). The primary clinical symptoms are pain and reduced jaw movement. Particularly in cases of long-term complaints, conservative treatment methods such as splint and physiotherapy often do not produce the desired results. For these patients, arthroscopy combined with lysis and lavage is the treatment of choice for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. In our department we performed this surgery on a total of 23 patients with discus displacement. With this low-risk procedure we achieved a definite improvement in symptoms in 20 patients; 11 of those patients were eventually complaint-free. Additionally, we can report a general improvement in opening the mouth. Except for a slight postoperative soft-tissue swelling, no complications developed. Thus, we can conclude that arthroscopic lysis and lavage, a low-risk and minimally invasive procedure, should be preferred to open arthrotomy in the primary treatment of tmj-displacements.
