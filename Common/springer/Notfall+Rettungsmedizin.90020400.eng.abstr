Progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies. This does also apply for stroke treatment: New pathophysiological knowledge, positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the demostrated importance of early treatment at Stroke Units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency. Timing is of utmost importance. Time-based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy. The treatment process is divided into three phases: alarming, pre-hospital and in-hospital phase. The effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables (personnel, technical equipment, course of the disease, etc.). Knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses, which allows an aimed improvement, e.g. public education, training of paramedics and medical personnel. Modern communication systems allow new information transfer, which can help to avoid unnecessary transport of patients.
