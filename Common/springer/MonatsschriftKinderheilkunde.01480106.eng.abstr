Nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of asthma. Although they are chemically different, there are many similarities in their mechanism of action. In provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests (allergen, exercise), but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as So2 challenge. Very few studies compared the two drugs. In children, only one study was done, showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium. Thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil, the other being proven effect of steroid- sparing, which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium. Both drugs are recommended as first-line agents in mild persistent asthma.
