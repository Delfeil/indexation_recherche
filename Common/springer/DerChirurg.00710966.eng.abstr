Abstract.  Paratesticular sarcomas are rare. We discuss this entity with the aid of a case report and the existing literature. The therapy of these tumors includes resection and possible adjuvant radiotherapy. Rhabdomyosarcomas are an exception, because they also show a good response to chemotherapy.
