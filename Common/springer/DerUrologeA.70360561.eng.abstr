High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis. The selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist, as the indication has to be carefully established. Exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions. Prior to HDCT haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional-dose chemotherapy plus G- or GM-CSF stimulation. HDCT consists of a combination of carboplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide. After HDCT, haematologic monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential. It is therefore recommended that HDCT only be administered at specialized centres.
