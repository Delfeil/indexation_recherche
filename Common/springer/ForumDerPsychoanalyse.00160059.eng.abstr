The confusion of scientific, economic, juridical and professional contexts is the reason for the present uneasiness within therapeutic culture. The author pleads for autonomy of these contexts to defend the profession reasonably against powerful overdetermination by other contexts. The debate about EST ("empirically supported therapy") is being drawn upon to show that the list of criteria for differentiation of effective and ineffective therapies is not warranted. Scientific or economic dominance claims might have deteriorating effects in the professional fields, as well-known researchers meanwhile fear. In economic contexts the aim is efficiency, in professional contexts it is quality. To develop own quality measures has the aim to promote the profession as a learning organization. Proposals are made. This could help to rise professionals' self-confidence.
