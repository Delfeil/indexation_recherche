A 67-year-old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome. Biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary glo-merulopathy on light and electron micros-copy. Other non-nephritic causes of a nephrotic syndrome (e.g. amyloidosis, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, light-chain glomerulopathy, cryoglobulinaemia, collagen-III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy) could be excluded. Besides the case report, differential diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulopathies is presented.
