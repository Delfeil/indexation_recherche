Juvenile bunions have different etiologies and require specific operative approaches. Any operative procedure to correct a juvenile hallux valgus deformity should correct all the components of the deformity, i. e. pronation of the hallux, the increased hallux valgus angle, the enlarged medial eminence, the increased intermetatarsal angle, and hypermobility or obliquity of the first metatarsocuneiform joint with the intention of decreasing the rate of recurrence.
