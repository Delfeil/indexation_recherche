Background: With regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues, microsurgical techniques, HLA typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection, and postoperative treatment schedules have been improved in recent years. This now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed. However, in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear.
