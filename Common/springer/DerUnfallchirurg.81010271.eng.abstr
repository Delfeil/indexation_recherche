In an overview the clinical and academic problems of this kind of fractures are described and their treatment is discussed. The most important problem is the pseudarthrosis that can happen in the framework of a conservative treatment of displaced fractures, rarely after operative treatment with K-wires. A rather academic problem is the obligatory growth disturbance of a partial stimulation of the lateral part of the growth plate. This leads to radial overgrowth and thus to a more or less distinct varus deformity. The extent of varus deformity is dependent on the time till consolidation, which is longest in conservatively treated fractures and shortest in those treated with compression screw osteosynthesis. An additional academic problem is the so-called fishtail deformity that becomes radiological visible at the end of growth. This deformity has no clinical significance. Pseudarthrosis, varus and fishtail deformity are a result of increasing instability of primarily or secondarily displaced fractures. All three problems can be avoided by metaphyseal compression osteosynthesis with an AO small-fragment screw with an additional axial K wire in the trochlea. Our own long-term results are shown and compared with the results of other procedures in the literature.
