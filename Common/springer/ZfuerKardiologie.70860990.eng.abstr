 Parallel with the increasing number of coronary stent implantation procedures, new or more elaborate coronary stents were introduced into clinical use almost every month in 1996. We have studied the architecture, surface-morphology, and shape-conversion of 16 different coronary stent systems. The objective of our study was to detect possible specific design and surface features which might influence the healing process, instent restenosis, and stent thrombosis. Using electron microscopy we found ultrasmooth surfaces on 5 stents. All other coronary stents revealed individually varying and partly sharp-edged surface irregularities. Video-based morphometry showed covering between 8.3% and 26.4%. Stent shortening after in-vitro expansion ranged from 0% up to 10.5% of the initial stent length. In some stent systems balloon dilation lead to over-expansion of the stent margaine. This over-expansion mounted up to 20% of the balloon diameter and the stents revealed a rather biconcave than homogenous expansion pattern. This phenomenon was also found after postmortal stent implantation in 20 autopsied hearts.
