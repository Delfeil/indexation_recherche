Median craniofacial clefts are classified as median facian cleft deformities and are characterized by clefts of the nose involving the skull base. They can be accompanied by hypertelorism and/or encephaloceles. From a total of 22 of our patients with median deformities, three encephaloceles and two severe median nasal clefts with hypertelorism were considered in 2-to-8-year-olds. Two children with severe brain deformities died before the commencement of therapy. The remaining median deformities were corrected as soon as possible, whereby exclusively soft-tissue surgery was performed during the first year of life and in no case later than school admittance. Final corrections on the nasal skeleton were made after the age of 12. No growth disturbances of the middle face or jaw occurred subsequent to craniotomies and corrections of hypertelorism. Plate osteosynthesis has proven to be the most reliable method of stabilization; we removed the osteosynthetic material in all cases. The multiplicity of possible deformities requires that procedures be tailored to the individual case.
