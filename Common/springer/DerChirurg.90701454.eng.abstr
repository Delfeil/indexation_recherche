 Background: The Whipple operation (PD) is the standard operation in patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region. However, the pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy (PPPD) is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function. Methods: In a prospective randomized trial (October 1994-October 1998) PD and PPPD were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life, operation time, duration of hospital stay, transfusions and perioperative morbidity. Quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions (EORTC-QLQ-30) pre- and postoperatively (weeks 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60). Results: A duodenopancreatectomy was performed in 48 patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas (n = 38) and the periampullary region (n = 10) (PD, n = 24; PPPD, n = 24). The PD and PPPD groups did not differ according to age, gender or UICC stage. Operation time was shorter in the PPPD group (206  +/-  48 vs 306  +/-  54 min) (P < 0.05). Morbidity did not differ between the two groups (PPPD 20 % vs PD 30 %, P > 0.05). While there was no difference in global quality of life, gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the PPPD group regarding appetite, nausea and diarrhea (P < 0.05). While the preoperative body weight was reached after 6 months in 85 % of the PPPD group (n = 20), this was true in only 60 % of the PD-group (n = 14) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: PPPD seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than PD.
