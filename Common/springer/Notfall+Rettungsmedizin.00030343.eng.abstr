Media reports convey the impression that the incidence of fatal accidents in the European Alps has been increasing yearly at an alarming rate. Although objective data is lacking, the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in Germany, Austria, the southern Tirol, Switzerland and the Chamonix region in France were analysed with respect to the fatal and non-fatal accidents which occurred between 1987 and 1997. Because of varying definitions of "mountain accident" used in these countries, available data about the number of fatalities are not comparable.
