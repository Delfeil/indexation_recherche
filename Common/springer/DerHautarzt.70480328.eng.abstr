Two young female patients presented with recurrent erythema and Henoch-Schönlein purpura respectively. In both cases clinical, histological and radiological showed relatively mild, but previously undiagnosed Crohn's disease as a trigger. We describe the treatment of the underlying disease and the symptomatic treatment of skin lesions. Categories of specific and unspecific skin lesions associated with Crohn's disease, as described in the literature, are presented. Vasculitic changes of the deep versus the superficial dermal plexus are discussed.
