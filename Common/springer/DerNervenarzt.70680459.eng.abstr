The trend in recent neurosurgery is going toward further reduction of invasiveness and avoidance of traumatization of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves to reduce the risk of neurological and mental deficit. In this way, the duration of hospital stay and disablement can be shortened. An important "minimally invasive" technique is neuroendoscopy. The ventricular system and the sub- arachnoid space of the brain give suitable conditions for the use of an endoscope. Non-communicating hydrocephalus is the most frequent indication for an endoscopic ap- proach. However, arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors, and intraventricular lesions may also effectively be treated with an endoscope. Using special instruments, laser devices, and bipolar diathermy, even highly vascularized lesions, such as cavernomas, may be completely resected. Moreover, endoscopes are used in the treatment of various spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as in endoscopy-assisted microsurgery.
