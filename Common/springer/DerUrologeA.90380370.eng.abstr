A 74-years old patient is admitted to the hospital with a over a period of 4 years growing, scrotal, ulcerated tumor. There is no connection to the testicle or the epididymis palpable. All laboratory findings including the tumorparameters are normal. The scrotal sonography shows a solid tumor, that is filled with vessels in the Doppler sonography. The complete tumor resection with histological examination leads to the diagnosis of a scrotal leiomyoma. This rare, benign tumor is a differential diagnosis to paratesticular or non-germinal tumors.
