In the present study disorders of thinking were studied in normals, patients with neurotic disorders, borderline patients and both acute and chronic schizophrenics. Disorders of thinking were assessed by the Holtzman Inkblot Technique. By a factor analysis, different dimensions of disordered thinking characteristic of the different diagnostic groups could be identified. Among others two dimensions of schizophrenic thought disorder and one of borderline thought disorder could be identified. This latter dimension showed high correlations with anxiety and hostility. This was true for a dimension of productive schizophrenics thought disorders, but not for a dimension of negative schizophrenics thought disorders.
