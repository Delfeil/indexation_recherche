Amiodarone can occasionally lead to a slate-coloured pigmentation in chronically UV-exposed skin. A 63 year old patient presented with a pruritic bluish-purple pigmentation of the face 2 years after taking 400 mg amiodarone daily for 2 years. During the 24 months after the dose was reduced to 200 mg daily, the pigmentation remained unchanged. Amiodarone pigmentation is caused by the UV-induced accumulation of lipofuscin in dermal macrophages, depending on both the daily dose and the duration of therapy. In the differential diagnosis, pigmentation caused by other drugs is the main consideration. Cessation of therapy eventually leads to complete normalization of skin colour.
