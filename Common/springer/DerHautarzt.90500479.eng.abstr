Romberg disease, also known as progressive facial hemiatrophy (PFH), is an uncomman disease with progressive facial asymmetry as the major symptom. It is a atrophic process of the subcutaneous fatty tissue whose etiology is unknown. Skin, muscles and bones can be secondarily afflicted. With MRI evaluation we were able to show in 14 patients with PFH thinner subcutaneous fat, as well as flattening of the dermis in 12 of the 14. We divided the patients into three stages by the means of the MRI findings and found tendency towards concurrence between the MRI stage and the clinical stage.
