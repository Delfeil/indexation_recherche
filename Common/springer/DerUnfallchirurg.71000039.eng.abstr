Two different types of cell-line and fresh human osteoblasts, cultured from cancellous bone grafts from the iliac crest, were used for the study. Three different biomaterials were compared regarding biocompatibility: titanium, steel and hydroxyapatite. The cells were fibroblast cell line (3T3), "osteoblast-like" cell line (MC3T3-E1), and fresh human osteoblasts (HOB) which we cultured in our laboratory. 5x104 cells of each type were seeded on the three different bone implants. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity were determined 24 and 72 h after the cells were plated on the biomaterials. Human osteoblast growth was better on titanium than on steel and hydroxyapatite. The most remarkable observation was the continuously decreasing alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) of "osteoblast-like" cells (MC3T3-E1) and human osteoblasts (HOB) on hydroxyapatite. In conclusion, our in vitro observations suggest that the best cell/material interactions were with human osteoblasts (HOB) and titanium.
