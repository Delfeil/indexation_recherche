Dysplastic epithelia represent potentially precancerous conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case. The positive predictive value of mild and moderate dysplasias of the uterine cervix is only about 13%. Using DNA image cytometry on restained, conventional Pap-smears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells. The identification of DNA aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90%. DNA aneuploidy qualifies squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade (H-SIL) which have to be treated whereas lack of DNA aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL) which have only to be controlled. The methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation.
