 An "Interdisciplinary Consensus Statement on the Diagnosis and Therapy of Testicular Tumors" was prepared in 1996 by the "Interdisciplinary Testicular Tumor Working Group" (IAH) with input from representatives from diagnostic and therapeutic disciplines of various working groups of the German Cancer Society (Strahlenther Onkol 1997;173:397-406). In 1998 the IAH met again together with the "Testicular Tumor Working Party" of the Urooncology Working Group (AUO) and formed the "German Testicular Cancer Study Group (GTCSG). Defined and accepted interdisciplinary standards from the initial meeting were revised based on current scientific developments and clinical results. This cooperating effort increases the quality of the initial recommendations and helped to put the recommendations for diagnosing and treating testicular on a broader scientific basis.  According to the principles of "evidence-based medicine" (EBM), the Consensus from 1996 was modified, based on the current level of evidence from the published literature. The methodological process and evaluation criteria used were that of the "Cochrane Collaboration".  An "Interdisciplinary Update Consensus Statement" summarizes and defines the diagnostic and therapeutic standards according to the current scientific practices in testicular cancer. For 21 separate areas scientifically based decision criteria are suggested. For treatment areas where more than one option exist without a consensus being reached for a preferred strategy, such as in seminoma in clinical Stage I or in non-seminoma Stages CS I or CS IIA/B, all acceptable alternative strategies with their respective advantages and disadvantages are presented. This "Interdisciplinary Update Consensus" was presented at the 24th National Congress of the German Cancer Society on March 21st and subsequently evaluated and approved by the various German scientific medical societies.
