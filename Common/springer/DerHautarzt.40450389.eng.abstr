Abstract.  Lupus vulgaris is now a rare dermatological disease. However, in view of the increase in risk factors (immigration from areas endemic for tuberculosis, multiply drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, HIV), cutaneous tuberculosis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis. We report on a case of lupus vulgaris vegetans of the nose, which developed by way of autoinoculation of the patient with Mycobacterium tuberculosis from reactivated, pulmonary tuberculosis and responded well to tuberculostatic therapy.
