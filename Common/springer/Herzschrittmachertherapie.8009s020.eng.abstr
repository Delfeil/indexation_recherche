 The electrophysiologic mechanisms for the maintenance of atrial fibrillation still needs to be elucidated. The multiple wavelet hypothesis of Moe could be confirmed in experimental and clinical mapping studies. However, the role of preferential pathways, periodicities, and other factors for the perpetuation of atrial fibrillation is unclear.  In intraoperative biatrial mapping studies, Cox et al. could demonstrate complete reentrant circuits during atrial fibrillation in the right atrium. Left atrial reentry could not be demonstrated, probably due to the limited spatial mapping resolution in that area. In other intraoperative mapping studies, Konings et al. registered the activation sequences during atrial fibrillation at the right atrial free wall with very high spatial resolution. Based on the spatiotemporal complexity of atrial activation during atrial fibrillation, three types of atrial fibrillation were defined. Patients were classified according to the predominant activation pattern and, therefore, the classification in different types is part of a continuous spectrum. Haissaguerre et al. performed catheter mapping studies to investigate regional disparities in fibrillatory activity during paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In their study, edocardially trabeculated areas revealed predominantly organized activity during atrial fibrillation, whereas the nontrabeculated areas were significantly more fibrillatory. In most cases, atrial fibrillation resulted from the simultaneous existence of instable reentrant circuits. However, in a small subgroup of young patients without structural heart disease, the typical surface ECG pattern of atrial fibrillation was produced by a single focal source that could successfully be ablated with discrete radiofrequency energy application.
