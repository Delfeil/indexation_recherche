With the recent changes in the German health service, psychoanalysis as a therapeutic method gets into increasing difficulties. The self-satisfaction of having the therapeutic monopoly in the health service for 20 years has led to ignoring the development of other probably even superior methods. The favouring of long-term therapy and the puristic fencing off of other approaches have led to an impasse. If psychoanalysis wants to continue to have a place in the German health service, the so far neglected brief and medium-term therapeutic approaches need to be supported. Their efficiency needs to be improved through the integration of elements from other therapeutic methods and through research. Fürstenau's integrative model of psychoanalytic-systemic psychotherapy as a method proved to be worthwile is presented. Its application within the medium-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (which is part of the funded psychotherapy in the German health system) is outlined. The author describes the difficulties that a psychoanalytically trained psychotherapist encounters in freeing himself from the restrictions of the method, as well as the rewards he has through gaining therapeutic competence and efficiency.
