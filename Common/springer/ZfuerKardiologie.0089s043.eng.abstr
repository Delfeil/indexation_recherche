 Electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) allows viszalization and quantification of calcium in the coronary arteries. This has been demonstrated to correlate well with the overall plaque burden in the coronary arteries. EBCT is, therefore, well suited for the detection of early stages of coronary atherosclerosis. Especially in asymptomatic patients with several risk factors, staging coronary artery disease by coronary calcium, scanning may allow prognostic assessment and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions.
