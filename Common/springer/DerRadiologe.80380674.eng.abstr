In the workup of patients suffering from spinal trauma the radiologist is eager to make a proper diagnosis asking only for few additional examinations. This can be done by a functional and biomechanical approach in reading standard radiographs. With the knowledge of the kind of injury expected the whole extent of posttraumatic changes in the spine can be delineated exactly. The goal is to make a diagnosis that answers questions of stability so the traumatologist can be aided in therapy.
