Chronic testicular pain represents a challenging urological chronic pain syndrom in terms of adequate diagnosis and therapy. Reported success rates of 55-73 % and 10-40 % of conservative and surgical interventions are extremely low. We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as therapeutic option in patients with chronic testicular pain (CTP). 12 consecutive patients with CTP were included in our study. After complete diagnostic workup and positive response to testicular nerve blockade, all patients underwent surgery: the cremasteric muscle was dissected by electrocautery, the periadventitial layer of the testicular artery was dissected over a length of 2-3 cm. After a median follow-up of 20.6 months (4-62) 11/12 patients (92 %) are pain free. None of the patients suffered from intraa- or postoperative complications. Based on our experience microsurgical testicular denervation should be performed in patients with CTP and no underlying organic disease. However, the high success rate of our surgical procedure can only be maintained if the selection of suitable patients is performed very carefully and a specific organic origin of CTP has been excluded prior to surgery.
