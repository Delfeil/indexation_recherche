Until a few years ago an estimation of the genetic risk of mutagenic action on human germ cells had to be based on data obtained by practically performed mutagen research over decades. Detailed knowledge about the differing levels of mutagen sensitivity of the various stages of germ-cell development was also obtained based on experimental mammal studies. New technical developments in the last 10 years have allowed the first direct insights into mutagenic action on human germ cells. Moreover, the number of reports on the offspring of individuals exposed to strong mutagens has also increased, which is even more important for estimation of the genetic risks of mutagen exposure. They document in a highly convincing way the evident and efficient activity of modifying factors that drastically reduce the number and spectrum of the originally induced mutations. Because of these findings the risk estimation of genetic counseling of mutagen-exposed individuals can now have a more solid basis.
