 The maintenance and/or improvement of medical quality standards despite limited resources can only be achieved through structural improvements which are accompanied by appropriate and effective rationalization measures. Decisions on economy measures in intensive care medicine which do not result in a quality reduction require fundamental and differentiated knowledge of (1) the degree of severity of the illness and the treatment result, (2) the actual patient-related service expenditure, and the costs connected with it. The precondition for this is the patient-related service data acquisition with the determination of individual, cumulative treatment costs, as well as the average costs per day. By including the individual personnel expenditure required in the cost analysis, it appears that, in the future, it will be possible to timely recognize and favorably influence undesirable developments in requirement planning and the allocation of resources. Additionally, the transparency of the provided services represents an objective basis for the discussion of resource allocation.
