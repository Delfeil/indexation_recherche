Background: Iridodonesis is the clinical sign of lens subluxation. Acute glaucoma caused by a ciliolenticular block may develop. YAG iridotomy or peripheral iridectomy are rarely effective in controlling intraocular pressure. The results of phacoemulsification and posterior lens implantation for subluxated lens and glaucoma are reported.
