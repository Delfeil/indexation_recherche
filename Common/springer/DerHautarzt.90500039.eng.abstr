Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem a (ULE) is a self-limited, probably infectious-allergic skin disease predominately affecting small children. We describe five such cases. The typical unilaterally located or at least unilaterally dominant exanthem usually starts in the axillary region and is characterized by red, partly confluent papules and fine scales. Two of the children presented with atypical manifestations of ULE. Due to its asymptomatic course, therapy is not necessary in the majority of cases.
