With the high-resolution ultrasound technology available today, the rapid embryofetal development during the first trimester can be imaged in detail. Thus, malformations can also be recognized if especially searched for. In the literature an enormous number of ultrasonographic normal values concerning early pregnancy have been published, and there are innumerable case reports of early diagnosed malformations of various organ systems. With a targeted search more than half of anomalies detectable in the second trimester can be seen at the end of the first trimester. These data, however, are insufficient to justify the introduction of early screening for fetal anomalies. With a burdened history a targeted exclusion diagnosis can contribute to the first psychological relief of the parents. If there are abnormal findings, in many cases the prognosis can not be ascertained and some anomalies appear only temporarily in later healthy children. Therefore, hasty conclusions should be avoided.
