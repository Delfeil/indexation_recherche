  Myocardial infarction shows a circadian pattern with a maximum in the early morning hours. In patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), it is assumed that apnea-associated changes of hemodynamics, blood gases, and rheology lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep. This investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without SRBD.
