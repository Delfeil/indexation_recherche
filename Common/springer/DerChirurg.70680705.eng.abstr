 During the past 10 years (1987-1996), 842 laparotomies were performed for pancreatic or periampullary neoplasms; in 25 patients (2.9 %) a neuroendocrine tumor was diagnosed. In 19 of these 25 patients (76 %) a non-functioning endocrine tumor and in 6 patients (24 %) a hormone-active tumor (four insulinoma, one gastrinoma, one VIPoma) was found. Of 19 non-functioning neuroendocrine tumors, 14 were malignant. The resection rate of these malignant tumors was 78.6 % (11 of 14; 3 resections were palliative); in comparison, the resection rate of ductal pancreatic carcinoma in our hospital was 28.1 %. The probability of 5-year survival amounts to 73 % after surgical resection in malignant endocrine tumors and to 19 % in ductal pancreatic carcinoma (including palliative resections). As it is not always clear whether non-functioning endocrine tumors are benign or malignant, oncological resection is recommended. Adjuvant chemotherapy seems not to be necessary.
