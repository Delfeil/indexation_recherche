In correction of the ureterovesical junction, the pathology can be corrected using an extravesical or intravesical technique. We performed an extravesical antireflux procedure with the dismembered or non-dismembered technique in 117 ureters between March 1991 and March 1996 at our Department of Pediatric Urology. The success rate was 94.9 % (111 renal units). Postoperative morbidity and complications were minimal, hematuria and bladder spasms were not seen. Associated pathology like paraostial diverticula, megaureter with the necessity for modeling and ureter duplex do not compromise the success rate.
