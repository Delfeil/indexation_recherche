 Nosocomial infections diminish the prognosis and clinical outcome of patients with acute stroke. This retrospective study was performed to investigate epidemiological data and risk factors for the development of nosocomial pneumonia in 50 patients (25 supra- and 25 infratentorial acute infarctions) treated in a neurological ICU. A total pneumonia incidence of 42% (21/150) was observed. In 19 cases (85%), the diagnostic criteria of early-onset pneumonia were fulfilled, and 15 of 19 patients were mechanically ventilated. The incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in infratentorial infarctions. Compared to supratentorial ischemic lesions, patients with HI-infra presented with a significant higher disturbance of consciousness (assessed with the Glasgow Coma Scale) and severity of the disease (assessed with the APACHE II Scale). Besides poor performance in GCS and APACHE II, the necessity of early endotracheal intubation and the presence of infratentorial infarction were identified as risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in acute stroke. Our results demonstrate the pathogenetic relevance of altered consciousness presumably leading to tracheal aspiration. For clinical concerns, stroke patients with infratentorial infarction and impaired consciousness should be classified as a high-risk group and receive intensive prophylactic treatment.
