Arthrofibrosis represents an important complication of anterior cruciate ligament surgery, resulting in postoperative pain and loss of motion. Various pre-, intra-, and postoperative measures have been shown to reduce the incidence of arthrofibrosis. Preoperative measures include the delay of surgery until the inflammatory phase after the initial trauma has been resolved, a physical therapy program and patient selection and counseling. Intraoperative measures focus on correct tunnel placement, aided by arthroscopic and radiological control for graft impingement and avoiding knee strain during final graft fixation. Postoperative measures include a brace-free rehabilitation program, with initial passive hyperextension and early range-of-motion exercises. Regular clinical examinations should be performed to detect loss of motion problems early and initiate appropriate treatment. In the authors' experience arthrofibrosis can be prevented if these recommendations are followed.
