The paper describes the concept for a form of in-patient treatment for anxiety disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders based on a combination of cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic therapy which is currently still being applied as a model. We present the case of a female patient with a severe obsessive compulsive disorder as an example of this combined therapy. The idea for a form of treatment based on a combination of behavioral and psychodynamic therapy is based primarily on the hypothesis that there is a subgroup of patients, still to be identified, who benefit more from an interrelated combination of both therapeutic approaches than from behavioral therapy alone - the latter being the most effective technique in the treatment of anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders. As far as the psychodynamic component is concerned, the 12-week combination treatment essentially comprises a high-frequency group therapy with a psychodynamic orientation and a defined focus of treatment. The behavioral therapy is conducted in an individual setting with co-therapeutic support and consists of an exposure and response prevention as the central component of treatment. A significant and steady improvement in the obsessive compulsive symptoms was achieved in the patient in the course of treatment. In addition to a concrete description of the therapeutic approach, the paper provides psychometric evaluation data, including a six-month catamnesis.
