Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) should be an "evidence-based" diagnosis derived from clinical and echocardiographic screening of informed and consenting relatives of index patients, and on the examination of clinical reports for deceased relatives. Most familial dilated cardiomyopathy pedigrees show an autosomal pattern of inheritance. Very few of them are X-linked and matrilinear. Autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence-based setting. By linkage analysis, several loci, but no disease gene, have been identified. At present, few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis.
