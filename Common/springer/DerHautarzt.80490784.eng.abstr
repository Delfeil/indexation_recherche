Papillary cystadenoma of the minor salivary glands is a rare benign tumor that clinically resembles a mucous cyst. We demonstrate its histologic features and differential diagnosis by a case report. Benign and malignant neoplasms of the minor salivary glands are not well acknowledged in the dermatologic literature, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis for mucous cysts.
