 A high specificy and a high positive prediction has been reached in risk stratification for a sudden cardiac death after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by combining multiple methods. But sensitivity and negative prediction are still not satisfying. There are the same physiological processes underlying magnetcardiography (MCG) and electrocardiography (ECG). Nevertheless, the signals in each method contain different information.
