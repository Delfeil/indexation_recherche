  Patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) may have a polyuria after termination of tachycardia. There is increasing evidence that the renal peptide urodilatin (ANP(95-126)) - and not plasma ANP (ANP(99-126)) - is the member of the natriuretic peptide family mediating natriuresis and diuresis in man.
