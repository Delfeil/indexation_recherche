This is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56-year-old male. Recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis, as the patient could not remember any trauma. After performing MRI, a 12 x 5 mm signal-free zone showed up in the area of the lateral condylus femoris, which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed. The patient was discharged soon after without any complaints.
