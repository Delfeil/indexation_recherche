Closed-system anaesthesia provides the best prerequisites for optimal warming and humidification of anaesthetic gases. The PhysioFlex anaesthesia machine fascilitates quantitative closed-system anaesthesia. Furthermore, its design may improve the climatisation of the anaesthetic gases by revolving the system volume at 70 l/min, using a small soda-lime canister to allow optimal usage of the heat and moisture generated by CO2 absorption and by integrating all system components in thermally isolating housing. To determine the capacity of the PhysioFlex to climatise anaesthetic gases, we evaluated the heat and humidity profile at four characteristic places in the anaesthetic circuit under standardised conditions in a model.
