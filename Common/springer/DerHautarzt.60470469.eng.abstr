A 24-year-old woman from Peru presented with multiple dark-blue skin lesions. The asymptomatic cystic nodules had increased in number and size over the post 7 years. They were found on the abdomen and back. When one of the cysts was punctured a bunch of vellus hairs was observed. The diagnosis of steatocystoma multiplex was confirmed by histology. The patient denied that any other family member had similar problems.
