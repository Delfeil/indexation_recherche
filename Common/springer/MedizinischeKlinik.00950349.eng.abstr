Background: The benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis is an autosomal recessively inherited liver disease. The gene was mapped to a region on chromosome 18q21-22. Because of its rareness this disease is first considered in the differential diagnosis of cholestasis after many years of extensive investigations.
