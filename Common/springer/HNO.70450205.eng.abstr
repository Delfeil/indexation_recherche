Central to inner ear research are questions regarding the homeostasis of the high endolymphatic potassium concentration (~150 mmol/l) and the high endocochlear potential (~+80 mV). Disturbances of the endocochlear potential can lead to the immediate loss of hearing which may be irreversible. The molecular mechanism leading to the generation of the endocochlear potential has not yet been discovered in spite of its clinical relevance. It is long known, however, that the stria vascularis is responsible for both the generation of the endocochlear potential as well as the secretion of potassium into endolymph. Recent investigations have clarified the mechanisms leading to the secretion of potassium and have led to the formulation of a now widely accepted model. This model explaining potassium secretion as well as the generation of the endocochlear potential is discussed in the present article.
