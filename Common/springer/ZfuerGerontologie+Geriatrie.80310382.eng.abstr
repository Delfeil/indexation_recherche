  As the results of the structural reform policy regulating the health care sector, the paper presents the possible path of increasing intrasectoral risk selection and intersectoral risk externalization (especially between the law of health care insurance, the law of statutory nursing inusrance, and the German poverty law). Particularly the new developments in the hospital sector will be analzyed regarding the dynamics of risk selection and risk externalization. The new economic ways of financing the hospital sector are inducing the need of systematic integration of the different branches of social law, especially more developed networks of the health care, the nursing system, and the social care services.
