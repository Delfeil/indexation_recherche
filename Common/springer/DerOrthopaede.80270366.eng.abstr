Reviewing the literature the revision arthroplasty of the hip joint with acetabular reinforcement rings shows good results concerning a follow-up period of six years in comparison with cemented or non-cemented primary implants. We use different acetabular reinforcement rings with differentiated indications. The primary assignment is the secure fixation of the ring to the vital bone. The acetabular bone defect is filled with autogenous or homogenous bone grafts. The increasing number of massive acetabular defects made us develop a new acetabular reinforcement ring. It allows a better fixation than the Burch-Schneider Ring and is cheaper than the individual acetabular implant. Since 1988 we performed 262 revision arthroplasty with acetabular reinforcement rings. Until 1996 we evaluated 174 reinforcement rings (41 Müller rings, 72 Ganz rings, 41 Burch-Schneider rings, 6 RS or RSH rings, 5 individual acetabular implants). After an average follow-up period of 5,6 years a radiological or clinical loosening of the acetabular component occurred in only 6 patients (3,4 %). To reach a better comparison of the surgical results we developed a score, which differentiately checks the operative goals. On plane pelvic radiographs we checked the reconstruction of the rotationcenter, the demarcation of the acetabular component and the outcome of the bone transplant.
