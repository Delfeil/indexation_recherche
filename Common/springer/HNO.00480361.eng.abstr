The osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be drainaged permanently or healed through an endonasal access. The obliteration of the frontal sinus is endangered in cases of multiple fracturing of the posterior frontal sinus wall or if it has been destroyed by an inflammatory process. In these problematic cases obliteration bears the danger of complications and cranialization of the frontal sinus is therefore the method of choice. We review 8 patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique. Indications for surgery were a combined fracture of the anterior and posterior frontal sinus wall (3), a pyocele of the front sinus with extensive destruction of the posterior wall (4) and a large osteoma of the posterior frontal sinus wall (1). The frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision, the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue. The anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants. The follow up period was 1.8 years (11 months to 8 years). All patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ENT-examination and radiological assessment by CT-scan or MRI. The overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent. There were no serious complications nor any recurrence. The cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration.
