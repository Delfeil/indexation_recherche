 A 60 year old Greek woman was admitted because of fever, shivering, and suspicion of vaginal bleeding. Physical examination showed a seriously ill patient with pale and yellow color of the skin. The urine was dark-red. There was marked hemolytic anemia with hemoglobinuria. Further investigations revealed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency with hemolysis after ingestion of fava beans three days prior to admission. Treatment consisted of forced diuresis, urine alkalinization, and erythrocyte transfusion. Because of self-limitation of the hemolytic anemia, the patient quickly recovered without complications. Mediterranean descent, ingestion of fava beans, and hemolytic crisis soon turned suspicion to inherited glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Information of the patient and her relatives about the genetic defect and hemolytic drugs or vegetables is necessary.
