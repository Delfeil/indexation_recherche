The human uterus is composed of the paramesonephric archimetra and the non-paramesonephric neometra. The archimetra consists of the glandular as well as stromal part of the endometrium and the subendometrial myometrium and meets several fundamental functions in the early process of reproduction such as providing the site of implantation, uterine directed sperm transport and high fundal implantation of the embryo by uterine peristalsis as well as inflammatory defence. The neometra is composed of the stratum vasculare and stratum supravasculare. Its main function is to provide the forces for expulsion of the fetus. Endometriosis is considered a disease of the archimetra in that it constitutes a non-obilgatory consequence of uterine adenomyosis or its early manuifestations. This view is supported by several lines of evidence. First: The eutopic endometrium shows alterations similar to those seen in endometriotic lesions that are not found in the endometrium of women free of disease. Second: Uteri of women with endometriosis display hyper- and dysperistalsis of which the extent does not correlate with the severity of the disease. This dysfunction results in a break down of rapid and sustained directed sperm transport and may explain sterility and subfertility in women with mild-to-moderate endometriosis. Third: In women with endometriosis there is a proliferative and infiltrative expansion of all elements of the archimetra into the outer myometrial layers. There is no correlation of the extent of the infiltrative expansion with the grade of endometriosis but with the age of the patients. In MR imaging these findings are similar or identical with those found in adenomyosis.
