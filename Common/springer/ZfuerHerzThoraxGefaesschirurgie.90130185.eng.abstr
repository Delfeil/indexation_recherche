 In intensive care medicine, percutaneous tracheostomy is internationally recognized as a practicable and safe alternative to conventional surgical tracheostomy. This also holds true for Fantoni's translaryngeal technique (TLT). Nonetheless, there are a number of reports of technical problems in the performance of TLT, especially with regard to the retrograde passage of the guide wire and the rotation of the cannula. We modified TLT in that the guide wire was passed retrograde through the endotracheal tube under videobronchoscopic control. Also, prior to rotation of the tracheal cannula, its position was verified by laryngoscopy and corrected if necessary. Feasibility of these modifications were analyzed in terms of operating time and oxygenation of the patient. 25 patients underwent modified TLT on our cardiosurgical ICU. Operating time was 4.8 +/- 3.9 minutes on the average. This is more than 50% below reported operating times in previous studies. During the procedure, there were no significant changes in PaO2 or oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2). Also, there were no technical problems or complications. Our modifications enhance the safety and practicability of TLT as compared to the original technique. Nonetheless, a definitive evaluation will have to await the publication of studies with a larger number of patients.
