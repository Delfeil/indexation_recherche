At present, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of low cardiac output states. Despite their positive inotropic and lusitropic effects, these drugs are still under discussion because of certain adverse effects like thrombopaenia, elevation of transaminases, abdominal disregulation, and excessive periphereal vasodilatation. As a consequence, more cardioselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors were developed with the aim of reducing these adverse effects. One of them, enoximone (Marion Merrell Dow, Fig. 1), an imidazole derivative, has nearly no influence on platelets and abdominal organ function. In addition, in many studies vasodilatation was found to be absent. Recently a new substance, R80122 (Janssen, Belgium, Fig. 1), was developed. First experimental studies showed high cardioselectivity of this substance. The aim of this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of enoximone and R80122 in patients with ischaemic heart disease.
