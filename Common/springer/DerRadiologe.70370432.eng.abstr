Imaging plays a major role in most neonatal gastrointestinal emergencies. The role may vary from helping to establish a diagnosis, to the evaluation of associated abnormalities, to surgical planning, or to therapy for some conditions like meconium ileus or meconium plug syndrome. Plain radiographs and ultrasound serve a primary imaging modalities with bowel contrast examinations, CT scan, and MR imaging playing roles in more complex cases.
