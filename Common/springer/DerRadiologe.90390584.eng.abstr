The routine staging work-up for renal cancer includes a contrast-enhanced multiphasic spiral CT and a chest radiograph. If there is doubt regarding the presence and extent of (supradiaphragmatic) IVC thrombus, MR imaging should be performed. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging should be used in place of CT in any patient with severe renal dysfunction, symptomatic polycystic kidney disease, or a history of allergy to iodinated contrast media. Cavography is no longer needed in the era of (adaptive array detector) spiral CT and MR venography.
