Background: In the past, the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect. Since the target tissue is not directly observable, no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon. High inter- and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under- or overdosage. Underdosage is therapeutically useless, while overdosage causes the so-called "popeffects" which may induce severe damage to the eye.
