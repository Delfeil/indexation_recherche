The liver is one of the most involved organs in the case of hematogenous metastases of breast carcinoma. In strictly intrahepatic involvement of breast cancer local ablative methods like surgical resection and minimal-invasive treatment modalities are discussed when systemic chemo- or hormone therapies are ineffective. In the clinical programme 51 patients with secondary metastastic involvement of the liver due to breast carcinoma were prospectively treated via MR-guided laser-induced thermotherapy in an outpatient setting. Patients were included with a maximum of five lesions up to a maximum diameter of 5 cm. Patients with additional extrahepatic involvement are excluded. MR-guided LITT allowed local tumor control in the liver at three months of 89.2 % and at six months of 79.1 %. The cumulative median survival rate was 50,29 months (confidence interval 95 %, 41.99-42.22 months). MR-guided LITT allows high local tumor control. Possible indications for the treatment with LITT are patients with strictly intrahepatic metastases who are not demonstrating a complete response after chemo- or hormone therapy.
