The present study is aimed at investigating differences between therapists of different theoretical orientations regarding their perception of patients who applied for psychotherapy at a university outpatient department. It was based on the judgements of nine psychodynamically and four cognitive-behaviorally oriented therapists about 144 and 89 patients, respectively, who were assessed after having completed their diagnostic interviews. Cognitive-behaviorally oriented therapists perceived the quality of the working alliance to be better and their feelings of sympathy towards the patients they had interviewed to be stronger than did psychodynamically oriented therapists. Psychodynamic therapists saw higher distress in the early childhood, whereas behavior therapists rated patients' present coping abilities higher. In addition, the latter judged patients' motivation, a common understanding of the illness, several prognostical factors and the global prognosis more favourable. Regarding the frequencies of disorder categories and the severity of functional restriction due to the disorders no differences were found. The results are discussed from both a cognitiv-behavioral and a psychoanalytical point of view.
