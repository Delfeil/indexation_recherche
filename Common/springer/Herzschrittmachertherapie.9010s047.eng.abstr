 For frequent ventricular ectopic beats, currently, reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the mainstays of treatment.  This study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients.  Catheter ablation was performed in 65 patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats. The site of origin of ventricular ectopic activity was accurately mapped by using pace mapping, earliest endocardial activation time, and unipolar mapping. In 5 patients a new non-contact mapping was additionally performed.  The ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in 37 and in the left ventricle in 28 patients. Ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49/65 patients (75%). During a mean follow up of 13 +/- 11 months, 9 of 49 successful ablated patients (18%) had a recurrence.  Radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity. It may, therefore, be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic, drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity.
