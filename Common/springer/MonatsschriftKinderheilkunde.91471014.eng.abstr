Bloom's syndrome is a rare condition which is doubtlessly underdiagnosed. It is characterized by pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, cutaneous lesions, a recognizable facial dysmorphism, recurrent infections and an excessive risk of cancer. The pathogenetic basis is a significantly increased genomic instability. Bloom's syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal-recessive trait. The responsible gene has been identified recently. We report on a 4 year old Turkish girl with Bloom's syndrome confirmed by an increased sister chromatid exchange rate. She came to our attention because of severe growth deficiency, but lacked the cutaneous signs.
