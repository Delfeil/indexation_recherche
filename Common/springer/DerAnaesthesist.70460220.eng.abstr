In a recent German multicenter study, 25% of the patients who suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest outside the hospital were resuscitated successfully and were discharged from the hospital. Approximately 100000 people suffer a fatal cardiac arrest in Germany annually, which is about ten times more than deaths resulting from motor vehicle accidents. New devices and techniques for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) have been developed in order to enhance the efficacy of chest compressions during CPR. The purpose of the present article is to review mechanisms of blood flow during CPR, to discuss CPR devices and techniques (vest CPR, CPR with interposed abdominal compressions, active compression-decompression (ACD) CPR, phased chest and abdominal compression-decompression CPR, and to further  evaluate results from subsequently published laboratory and clinical studies.
