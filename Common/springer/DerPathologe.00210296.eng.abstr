Bone marrow biopsy plays an important role in the clinical diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Further diagnostic methods need to be established to increase accuracy in the light of advances over recent years in the immunophenotypical characterization of discrete lymphatic bone marrow lesions and the continuing difficulty in classifying them. This study compared the diagnostic value of flow cytometry to that of conventional bone marrow biopsy in 156 patients with 191 marrow biopsy specimens or bone marrow aspirates. The most important findings were that up to one-third of lymphomas could not be diagnosed by flow cytometry, and that the degree of infiltration was estimated as less than two-thirds. However, flow cytometric results were more satisfactory in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In summary, flow cytometry has a complementary role in the staging of lymphoma but cannot fully replace conventional trephine biopsy.
