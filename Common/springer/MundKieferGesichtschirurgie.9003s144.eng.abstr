The therapeutic efficiency of Carboplatin (CP) and Ifosfamide (IF) with and without local hyperthermia (41  °C and 43  °C for 60 min respectively) was measured in human-derived oral squamous cell carcinomas (n = 97) growing on the shank of nude mice. Untreated tumors showed exponential tumor growth. The animals were randomly assigned to 10 different treatment groups (n = 9-10). The average tumor volume of the treated animals was compared to the untreated controls and statistically evaluated. CP alone demonstrated only significant growth delay (duration 60 days). IF (62.5 and 125 mg/kg b.w.) alone caused partial tumor regression. Combination of CP or IF with hyperthermia led to significant tumor regression. Tumor-free survival 60 days after treatment was observed as well after application of CP (6 mg/kg b.w.) and hyperthermia (43  °C) as well as after IF (125 mg/kg b.w.) and hyperthermia (41  °C).
