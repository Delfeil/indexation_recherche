Mutations of the p53 gene are the most commonly observed genetic alterations in malignant tumors and are often associated with a loss of the tumor suppressor function of the p53 protein. We have analyzed specimens of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) from 110 patients for p53 gene mutations and 92 of them additionally for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in order to evaluate the prognostic significance of these factors by comparison with clinical follow-up data. Using the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE), mutations within the exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were found in 48 tumors (44%). Sequencing revealed missense mutations in most cases (15/20). Frequency of p53 gene mutations was not related to the tumor stage, the grade of differentiation, the presence of lymph node metastases, or the smoking history of the patients. With the help of a highly sensitive PCR/hybridization assay, an infection with the high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 could be detected in 39/92 tumor specimens (42%). Follow-up data were obtained from 99 patients with a range of 2- 112 months. No correlation of overall survival on the presence of p53 gene mutations or HPV infection could be observed. The absence of statistically significant correlations between p53 gene mutations and progressive disease, however, does not exclude its putative relevance in early phases of tumor development.
