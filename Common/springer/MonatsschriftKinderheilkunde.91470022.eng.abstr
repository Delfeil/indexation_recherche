We report two patients with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 7 and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 17. Chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 17 in the parents and other relatives. Pedigree analysis reveals abortions, frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths. Our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms: prominent forehead, hydrocephalus internus with wide cranial sutures and fontanels, hypertelorism, cleft soft palate, low set dysmorphic ears, psychomotor retardation and micrognathie.
