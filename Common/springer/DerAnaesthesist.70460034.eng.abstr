Background: We report a case of irreversible unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy in connection with nasal septum surgery in intubation anaesthesia. On account of the spatial distance, there is no danger of injuring the hypoglossal nerve during nasal surgery. However, in the otorhinolaryngological and anaesthesiological literature, some cases of hypoglossal palsy following endotracheal intubation, use of the laryngeal mask airway, bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy are reported.
