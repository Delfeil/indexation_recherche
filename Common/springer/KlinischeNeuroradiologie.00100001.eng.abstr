Abstract:  In the late 1970s the technical improvement and the widespread use of angiography allowed increasing confidence with radiological and clinical features of spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery. If the association with stroke was early clear not as much rapid was the recognition that spontaneous dissection could cause cranial nerve palsy. Lower and more rarely upper cranial nerves can be involved frequently without cerebral ischemia. The etiopathogenesis of this syndrome is not completely clear. It is assumed that mechanical compression and/or ischemia of the nerves due to impairment of supplying arteries are responsible for the syndrome.
