The internal fixation of fractures of shaft bones was spread out by a group of surgeons working together with Prevot. The principle of this method is a three point load carrying(entry point, height of fracture and cancellous bone of the metaphysis of the opposite fracture part). From 1996 to 1999 86 children with fractures of the humerus, the fore-arm and the femur were operated in the technique of intramedullary nailing. The fractures affected the humerus to 3.5 %, the fore-arm to 65.1 % and the femoral shaft to 31.4 %. The postoperativ duration of stay in hospital after internal fixation of the fore-arm in the proximal and middle third lasted 7.2 days, the duration of immobilisation in a cast took 13.7 days. 96 % of the patients showed very good and good results after operation. The average stay in hospital for patients with femoral shaft fractures was 14.4 days. 17 weeks after operation the intramedullary nails were removed. At the time of first full weight bearing the legs showed an average shortening of 1.2 cm. The fractures of the humerus healed without any restriction of movements. Internal fixation is a minimal invasive operation technique with low risks and small operating trauma. Due to the stability a early mobilisation is possible. The reported results in the literature are all good. The only problem can be caused by too long nails irritating the skin.
