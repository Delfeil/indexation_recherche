We report a woman with erythema palmare hereditarium, an anomaly not documented so far in the German literature. It is characterized by a bright erythema of the palms, usually persistent since birth. It is transmitted in an autosomal-recessive mode and has a benign course. In our patient it was possible to trace the palmar erythema over three generations.
