A 52 year old female with Parry-Romberg syndrome presented with gradual atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and muscle on her chest and back. The disease process was limited to the C3 to T2 dermatomes on the right side. In addition, there was muscle atrophy of the right arm and extending down the back to T10, als well as right sided paralysis of the diaphragm. Sympathetic nerve blockage reduced pain and hyperesthesia; no progression was seen over several months using NMR to monitor the patient. The Parry-Romberg syndrome has been defined in many ways; in view of this unusual case, we review the literature, attempting to provide a more accurate case definition.
