Purpose: This prospective study was performed to investigate characteristic sonomorphological features and vascularity of reactively enlarged lymph nodes. Method: We examined 40 patients with enlarged lymph nodes of the neck by Doppler sonography before and after administration of an ultrasound signal-enhancing agent. Peak flow velocity, pulsatility- and resistant indices were assessed. Lymph nodes were sonomorphologically classified into three groups: homogeneous parenchyma (1), a centrally located echogenoic line (2) and an echogenoic "hilus reflex" (3). The quantitative and qualitative criteria were compared to histological findings. Results: A total of 15 lymph nodes appeared homogeneous. A centrally located echogenoic line was found in 17 (42.5%) nodes and echogenoic "hilus reflex" in 8 (20%). These sonomorphological patterns correlate to hilus fibrosis in the histological specimen. In 32.5% (13) of the nodes the analysis of vascularity was possible only after application of the galactose-based ultrasound signal enhancer. Quantitative analysis did not result in specific new aspects. Conclusions: Reactive lymph nodes show typical sonomorphological features. Administration of an ultrasound enhancer allows assessment of a characteristic nodal vascualrity.
