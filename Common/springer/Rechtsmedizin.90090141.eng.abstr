Abstract  The authors tested the possibilities for forensic personal identification based on the comparison of ante-mortem and post-mortem radiographs. From the Dept. of Radiology University Medical School of Pécs, Hungary 946 randomly selected radiographs of 9 different skeletal regions from 458 patients were examined. The aim of this study was to find the specific parts of the skeleton, which are anatomically variable or which frequently exhibit change due to pathological development, trauma or alterations from surgery. The results of the examinations showed that the skull has the most anatomically variable features. The long bones and the pelvic girdles showed a high number of alterations due to trauma, which suggests the importance and usefulness of these radiographs. However, the radiologically visible degenerations on the vertebral column could also be useful in the personal identification process and the authors recommend using detailed examination and careful analysis of these alterations.
