An investigation of 2486 benign cutaneous fibrous histiocytomas (BFH) at the Institute of Pathology of Münsterlingen, Switzerland, revealed a special group of histiocytomas, proliferative benign cutaneous fibrous histiocytomas (PBFH). These tumors recur 17 times more frequently than the so-called normal benign cutaneous fibrous histiocytoma (NBFH). A quantitative analysis of six histopathological parameters showed that PBFH can be differentiated from NBFH with a sensitivity of 95%.
