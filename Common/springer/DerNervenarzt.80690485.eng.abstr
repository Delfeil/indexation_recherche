Electroencephalography (EEG) is a well-tolerated non-invasive method and is therefore well suited for repetitive examinations. We performed serial EEG's on 117 HIV patients without any clinical signs of secondary neuromanifestation in order to document electroencephalographic changes in the course of HIV infection. Clinical signs of HIV-associated encephalopathy presented 18 patients at the first examination and 23 at reexamination. EEGs were analyzed visually; there was a mean interval of 20.3 +/- 13.7 months between the first and the second examination. Significant slowing of background activity occurred in the course of the disease; the  rhythm decreased from 10.7 +/- 2.3 Hz to 10.0 +/- 2.4 Hz (P<0.05) with an increase in amplitudes from 60.9 +/- 24.6 µV to 69.5 +/- 33.7 µV (P<0.05). The percentage of spontaneous dysrhythmias also increased from 30.7% to 41.8% (P<0.05); pathological findings provoked by hyperventilation increased from 13.6% to 18.2%. Foci occurred rarely and did not increase in frequency with time. CD4 cell counts decreased from 294.2 +/- 209.5/µl to 188.7 +/- 208.3/µl (P<0.01). The results of this study indicate progressive CNS dysfunction with worsening of the immunostatus.
