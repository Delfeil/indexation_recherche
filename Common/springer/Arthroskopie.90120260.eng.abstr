Most reports in the literature on the timing of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are retrospective. The majority of the authors propose delayed surgery of 4-6 weeks postinjury. In the present study, 45 consecutive ACL reconstructions performed within 2 weeks after injury are documented prospectively. The objective was to evaluate the rate of arthrofibrosis and to detect whether there is a difference between very early (< 3 days after injury) and early (4-14 days after injury) reconstructed knees. In group A ("very early"), 88% of the patients were available for final clinical examination after a mean follow up of  12.6 months. In group B ("early"), 90% of the patients were seen after a mean follow-up of 11.6 months. The overall (n = 40) rate of arthrofibrosis was 7.5%; for group A (n = 22) the rate was 4.5% and for group B (n = 18) 11%. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups comparing the following parameters: Duration of physical therapy and sick leave, manual Lachman testing, KT-1000 measurements, Lysholm score, and IKDC score. Although the difference was not statistically significant, the results regarding the activity level at follow-up are medically important: In group A, 77% of the patients had the same activity level compared to the preoperative status and 23% were less active. In group B, 61% showed the same activity level at follow-up and 39% a lower one. We conclude that in group A the late results in activity level are better and the incidence of arthrofibrosis is lower (4.5%) than for the patients operated on between 4 and 14 days after injury (arthrofibrosis rate 11%). We therefore suggest that early ACL surgery should be performed within 3 days after injury. In all other cases we recommend delayed ACL reconstruction after an interval of over 4-6 weeks, since the incidence of arthrofibrosis in group B was higher (11%) than in the existing literature on delayed ACL reconstruction.
