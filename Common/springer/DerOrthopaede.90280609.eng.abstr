Concerning the so-called minimal invasive procedures currently available for the treatment of lumbar disc prolapse (percutaneous endoscopic discectomy, APLD, laser decompression, chemonucleolysis), the intradiscal application of Chymopapain represents the method with the longest period of clinical use and experience. Long-term studies have shown good clinical results. When considering of the indication and the few contraindications - particularly allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis provides a low-risk, efficient, minimally invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
