The diagnosis of glenohumeral instability is based on the patient's history and physical examination. The main objective in using imaging techniques is to define the tpye and extent of the underlying pathology for therapeutic planning. Plain radiography is the initial step in the diagnostic procedure but can miss typical lesions of the glenohumeral joint structures. CT arthrography and MR imaging offer great sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of traumatic abnormalities of the labral-capsular complex, fractures of the glenoid rim and Hill-Sachs lesions. The advantages and pitfalls of both imaging techniques are discussed.
