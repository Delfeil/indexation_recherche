Patients with univentricular hearts present with a large variety of the underlying intra- and extracardiac anatomy. Both atria are connected to a morphologic left or right ventricle via two separate or a common atrioventricular valve (univentricular atrioventricular connection). The preoperative hemodynamic situation is characterized by complete intracardiac mixing of the systemic venous and pulmonary venous blood resulting in a variable degree of arterial desaturation; the systemic ventricle is exposed to chronic pressure and volume overload. Operations based on the Fontan principle involve complete separation of the systemic and pulmonary venous return. Further modifications of the original Fontan operation were leading to the total cavopulmonary anastomosis, which can be performed irrespective of underlying atrial and atrioventricular valve morphology. Postoperatively the systemic venous pressure is chronically elevated. Postoperative problems include atrial dysrhythmias, protein-losing enteropathy and rarely thrombembolic complications. Even under optimal preoperative circumstances longterm follow-up revealed a late decline in functional status. The modified Fontan operation for definitive palliation in patients with univentricular hearts remains to be associated with the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality.
