Nonunion of fractures in children is rare. It occurs after pathological fractures, post-infection and after incorrect osteosynthesis. Sometimes, delayed union of one bone in the forearm or the lower leg can be observed. Typical cases of nonunion are those of the radial condyle of the humerus and the femoral neck. A different problem is presented by congenital pseudoarthroses. The treatments of choice for nonunion are autogenous bone grafting and external or internal skeletal stabilization. In the radial part of the elbow joint the only indication for operative correction is an irritation of the ulnar nerve (ventralization of the nerve and supracondylar osteotomy). Nonunion of the femoral neck can be avoided by internal screw fixation.
