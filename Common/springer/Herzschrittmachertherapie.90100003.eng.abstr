 Improvements in medical therapy for advanced heart failure have improved prognosis. Nonetheless, mortality from both sudden and nonsudden death remains high. In addition, sudden death may occur in association with heart failure exacerbation. Clearly, avoidance of Type I antiarrhythmic agents and increased use of low dose amiodarone and transvenous ICD therapy decreases total mortality in a subset of patients. Further studies will help define the role of these therapies in sudden death prevention.
