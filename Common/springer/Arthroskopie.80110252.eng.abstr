Although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established, there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment. In order to sytematically analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures, we assessed 196 consecutive ankle fractures immediately before ORIF. There were 94 male and 101 female patients with an average age of 47.8 years (16-88 years). There were more cartilage lesions found than expected, and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type C-fractures than in type B-fractures. In both fracture types, an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group 1 to 3. In addition, more ligament injuries were found than expected, especially in the B.1- and B.2-fractures. Successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in 26 cases: internal fixation, 9; loose body removal, 7; ligament reposition, 5; cartilage smoothening, 4; and cartilage fracture repair, 1. In one case, a periostal flap could not be reduced, and in another case, the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable. In summary, arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures. As long-term results are not yet available, it remains, however, unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following ORIF. Arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures. Of these, percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication.
