 Since 1983 the administration of phenylalanine combined with UVA exposure (PAUVA) has been a well-known therapy for vitiligo. We have found no retrospective studies on this therapy. To document the long-term results and side effects, we performed a retrospective study on 41 patients who had received PAUVA therapy about 5 years ago. Examination was possible in 25 of the 41 patients, and 11 of them (44%) had permanent repigmentation. Depigmentation either during or after PAUVA therapy was recognized in 16 of the 25 patients (64%). In 52% of cases the patients were satisfied with the therapy and would repeat it; 68% would recommend it. Positive features in prognosis, i.e. indicative of good repigmentation, were vitiligo extending over less than 25% of the body surface, onset of vitiligo before the age of 21, generalized and symmetrical distribution and a long duration of UV therapy. None of our patients developed long-term side effects. PAUVA therapy is demonstrably a therapeutic alternative for certain patients.
