Traumatic, perilunate dislocations are rare lesions, and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures. Unfortunately, one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized, although conventional X-rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48% of cases, which can be improved by performing CT or bone scan in addition to 62% and 95%, repectively. Forced extension seems to be the most frequent trauma mechanism. The treatment consists of open reduction, predominantly of the lunate bone, and internal fixation. Huge carpal fragments such as the scaphoid and capitatum are ideally fixed by means of compression screws, while smaller fragments can only be aligned with Kirschner wires. Osteochondral chips are best reinserted into the bone by means of anchoring systems. In cases of complex carpal instability supplementary stabilization may be achieved with an external fixator. The best results on the Martini evaluation score were achieved in simple perilunate dislocations that were reset early by open surgical procedures and were accompanied by minimal involvement of/damage to different tissues. Although we had a nonunion rate of approximately 20% in our series of 11 mixed traumatized patients in all, the Martini classification of hand function seems to be a reliable score system for practical clinical follow-ups.
