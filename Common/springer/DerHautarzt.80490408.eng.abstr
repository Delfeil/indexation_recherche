A 7 year old boy presented with linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis (LWNH). This entity, delineated in 1988, is characterized by streaked or whorled, frequently reticulate hyperpigmented lesions following the lines of Blaschko without preceding inflammation and without atrophy. The age of onset is usually within the first 2 years of life. Histologically, there is a mild basal cell hyperpigmentation with prominent melanocytes. In contrast to earlier reports, we observed some melanophages in the upper dermis. Associated abnormalities have been reported in a few patients, but were absent in our case.
