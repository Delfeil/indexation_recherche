Aims: Chest pain in children is often suspected to originate from cardiac disease. Aim of this study was to characterise the symptomatology of supposed cardiac chest pain in children and to investigate whether cardiac disease indeed underlies the pain or not. Furthermore, indications for a psychosomatic origin of the pain were searched for.
