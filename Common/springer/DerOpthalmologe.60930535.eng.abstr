Reproducibility of measurements of the "Glaucoma-Scope", a new topometric device (software version 3.12), was assessed by optic disk analysis of 10 eyes in 10 healthy subjects. Each analysis was carried out by 4 independent observers. Examinations of one of these eyes were repeated 10 times by each one of the 4 observers. The instrument was also applied to a sample of 117 eyes in 60 patients from a glaucoma clinic. The minimal requirements were determined to be a pupil diameter of 5 mm and lens-related visual acuity >0.8. The coefficient of variation for the different optic disk parameters in the repeated examinations ranged from 3.5% to 15.7%. The maximal discrepancy between values of vertical C/D ratio within any of the subjects ranged from 0.01 to 0.12 (mean 0.05). Glaucoma-Scope measurements revealed a smaller value for disk area than those from computer-assisted manual planimetry, with a constant factor of 0.81. The measurement of vertical C/D ratio by Glaucoma-Scope and a stereoscopic estimate correlated highly in a subset consisting of 20 glaucoma patients and the 10 healthy subjects (r = 0.786; p<0.0001). A considerable discrepancy (larger or smaller) was apparent between values found through clinical inspection of 6 of the 117 eyes (4 of 60 patients) and those found with the Glaucoma-Scope. In these 6 eyes subsequent analyses utilizing a more recent software version yielded a good correlation between the two methods. The Glaucoma-Scope allows sufficiently reproducible optic disk topometry.
