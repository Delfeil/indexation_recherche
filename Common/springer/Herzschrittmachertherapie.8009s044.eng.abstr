 Currently, no therapy exists which reliably avoids recurrences of episodes of sustained atrial fibrillation and prevents the development of permanent, chronic atrial fibrillation. As antiarrhythmic drugs have rare but partly substantial side-effects, many patients are left with their atrial fibrillation and their ventricular rate can only be controlled by drugs or catheter ablation of the atrioventricular node.  Due to the success of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and the very effective treatment of atrial fibrillation by internal atrial defibrillation, implantable devices have been designed which can automatically defibrillate atrial fibrillation. Preliminary experience has been obtained with these devices in a few selected patients. Patients could be maintained in sinus rhythm during short-term follow-up and no ventricular proarrhythmic effects due to shock delivery were documented. However, the patients' tolerance of shocks and the amount of shocks needed to terminate episodes of atrial fibrillation is a major concern. Before indications for general use of implantable atrial defibrillators can be defined, further experience with such devices within studies is needed.
