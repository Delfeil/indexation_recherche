The Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome (CST syndrome) is the rare an- or hypohidrotic form of the ectodermal dysplasia. During embryonic development, the formation and maturation of the central nervous system and the epithelia of the sense organs, skin, teeth, hair (and less frequently the nails) are disturbed. In addition to the cosmetic impairment, insufficient or absent secretion of sweat and sebum is particularly discomforting as it leads to extreme heat intolerance. The decreased number of apocrine sweat glands and mucous glands in the upper nasopharynx results in diminished resistance to respiratory infections. We describe typical features of the disease in a 60 year old female patient, distinguishing this disease from other forms of ectodermal dysplasia. Diagnostic criteria as well as therapeutic options are discussed.
