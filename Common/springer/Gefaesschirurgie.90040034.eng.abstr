 Purpose: The aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease. Methods: From February 1996 to February 1998, 16 patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure (ABF) using the transperitoneal approach. Six, 5 to 12 mm ports were needed to dissect, cross-clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices. The aortic anastomosis was made end-to-side. A long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision. The distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally. Results: The laparoscopic ABF was performed successfully in 13 of 16 cases. Three times a conversion to open surgery was requested. One patient developed respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment on the ICU. Mean operative time was 292 +/- 60 min; the aorta was crossclamped for 74 +/- 18 min. Two patients needed transfusions of red blood cells. In the study group, blood loss averaged 566 +/- 434 ml. The bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography. The patients were discharged 9 +/- 5.8 days after surgery. At follow-up after 4.5 +/- 4 months, 15 patients were examined noninvasively in the vascular laboratory. All grafts were patent, and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in 14 patients. One patient with recurrent claudication had severe stenosis of the left distal anastomosis. Conclusions: The laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible, safe and effective procedure. Specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure. The development of vascular staplers and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge. In the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease.
