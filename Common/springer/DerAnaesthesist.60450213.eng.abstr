Patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) have a high risk of perioperative reinfarction compared with the normal population (5%-8% vs. 0.1%-0.7%) [10]. According to Rao [13], a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range. In most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as Rao recommended: this would overstrain both hospital structure and financial resources. We studied the incidence of perioperative MI and other cardiac events in patients with prior MI. During the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced. In addition to this clinical evaluation, we performed perioperative Holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin T (parts II and III).
