A residual shunt via the incompletely closed duct is seen in 40-50% of patients after transcatheter closure of patent duct with different occlud systems. A rare complication in patients with residual ductal shunting is the mechanically induced hemolytic anemia. We report of 3 children with this complication after incomplete closure of patent duct. In all three children the closure was tried, in two with a cook coil and in one with a Rashkind device. In two children laboratory findings of hemolysis returned to normal spontaneously and in one child a second implantation of cook coils was needed to stop the hemolysis.
