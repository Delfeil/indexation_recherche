  In recent years many different systems for transcatheter closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD) have been developed and tested. However, all systems presently available have some special disadvantages. The recently introduced Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO), though, appears promising. It is a self-expanding and self-centering double disc made from a Nitinol mesh, which is tightly woven to give mechanical strength. Both discs are separated by a connecting cylindrical portion. Its diameter may be chosen, so that it corresponds to that of the ASD.
