Transforaminal endoscopic spinal disc surgery is one of the newer minimal invasive percutaneous procedures for treatment of lumbar disc hernias. Both non-sequestered and sequestered hernias can be treated with this method. From January 1995 to December 1997 we conducted endoscopic discotomies in levels L3 to S1 in 80 patients. The patients were chosen according to strict indications. Initially local anesthesia was administered; as the learning curve grew spinal anesthesia was used. The results show that this method is effective and pathology targeted. Healthy tissue is conserved and the risk of postoperative fibrosis is low.
