On the basis of a solution-oriented marital therapy, the different within-session effects of four different types of questions in systemic therapy (lineal, strategic, circular, and reflexive), as described by Tomm (1989), were tested. In this single case study, the method of plan analysis (Caspar 1989) was used to categorize the client's reactions to the four types of therapeutic questions.  Lineal and strategic questions were expected to have a stabilizing and restraining effect on the system (i.e. the client, the clients' interaction, and the therapeutic interaction), whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change. Interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife, who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change. For the husband, who preferred the role of a cotherapist and demonstrated only little motivation for change, results were not as predicted. Some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects. Therefore, it is suggested that an interaction effect between questions and the motivation for change can be assumed.
