Intermittent symptoms of central airways obstruction in children and adolescents are rare and may well be confounded with symptoms of bronchial asthma. We report on a 17 year old male patient with pre-existing allergic asthma who developed a rough in- and expiratory stridor, especially during exercise and emotional stress. These symptoms showed no response to bronchodilators. Bronchoscopy demonstrated a prolapse of the arytenoid cartilage into the larynx during inspiration and a collapse of the aryepiglottic folds during expiration. Forced expiration also caused a subtotal collapse of the distal trachea and the main bronchi.
