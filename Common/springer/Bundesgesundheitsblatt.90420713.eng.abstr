At present conventional diagnosis of mycobacterial infections requires in case of posi- tive specimens about four weeks for culture followed by susceptibility testing. Negative results can be recorded after seven to eight weeks. Although some diagnostic proce- dures may be performed more rapidly applying new technologies like nucleic acid amplification techniques, at present this is still accompanied by a loss of sensitivity. The alarming global epidemiological situation of tuberculosis requires the development of new diagnostic technologies enabling rapid and accurate detection, differentiation, and  susceptibility testing of mycobacteria.
