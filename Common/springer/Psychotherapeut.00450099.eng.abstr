This epidemiological study demonstrates the spontaneous long-term course of predominantly psychosocially influenced ("psychogenic") disorders (neurotic spectrum disorders, personality disorders, stress reactions and somatoform disorders) in a representative community sample of the normal adult population of Mannheim, an industrial and university town in Germany. Begining in 1979, a random sample was investigated three times over a period of approximately 11 years (nt1=600, nt3=301). The psychodynamically trained and clinically experienced interviewers used a semi-structured interview and standardized clinical and psychometric instruments. Psychogenic impairment was assessed using a standardized expert rating (impairment score) with high reliability. The t3 sample was also representative of t1. The mean sum-score of psychogenic impairment after 11 years exceeded the value of t1. The case rate (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-diagnosis+clinical cut-off) increased from 21.6% (t1) to 26.2% (t3) in the investigated sample. Intra-individual correlation of psychogenic impairment was high even in the long term (r=0.55). We found strong evidence for an unfavorable long-term course of psychogenic impairment and only a weak tendency for spontaneous remission of psychogenic disorders. Women showed a significant worse course of psychogenic impairment than men. Further research on the predictive variables of the spontaneous long-term course of psychogenic disorders is needed.
