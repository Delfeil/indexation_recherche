 Patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases have a significantly higher risk for developing perioperative pulmonary complications than patients with healthy lungs. Most common perioperative respiratory complications are reduction of lung volumes, pneumonia, and bronchospasm, which contribute to increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. Patient's history and clinical examination are the most important measures to identify at-risk patients. Important risk factors for perioperative respiratory complications include chronic respiratory diseases, upper abdominal or thoracic surgery, obesity, and cigarette smoking. Most common pre-existing respiratory diseases are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma whereas restrictive lung diseases play a minor role. The incidence of perioperative pulmonary complications can be decreased if the severity of lung function impairment is identified and sufficient measures are implemented either preoperatively or at least postoperatively. This includes the choice of the adequate anesthesia technique as well as the optimal selection of anesthetics.
