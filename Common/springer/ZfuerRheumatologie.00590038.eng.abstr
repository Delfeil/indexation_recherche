 Evidence-based medicine (EBM) and evidence-based health care (EBHC) is one answer to the increasing need for quality and transparency in the care of individual patients as well as health care services. Using explicit and sound methodological criteria, EBM and EBHC question current management strategies for their effectiveness and usefulness to individual patients and patient groups. This approach therefore supports the implementation of rational patient-oriented care.
