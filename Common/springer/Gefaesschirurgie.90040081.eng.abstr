 Peripheral vascular disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, and over 3000 trials relating to its management have been published. Systematic reviews of this evidence are urgently required, as it is impossible for the individual clinician to sift through and evaluate all this information. The Cochrane Collaboration was established in 1992 to produce systematic reviews of all aspects of health care, and includes a Review Group specifically addressing issues relating to peripheral vascular disease. This is an international group examining all aspects of peripheral vascular disease, including abdominal aortic aneurysm, atherosclerotic disease of the lower limb, varicose veins, thromboembolism, and vasospastic disorders. Several reviews in key areas have been published, including the evidence for angioplasty, lipid-lowering therapy and exercise in intermittent claudication. More reviews are urgently required, and anyone with interest and enthusiasm is invited to contribute.
