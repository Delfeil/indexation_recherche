 In the last few years two placebo controlled studies (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Study) analyzed the effect of systemic thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute hemispheric stroke. Both studies showed a positive longtime effect for the rt-PA treated patients. The number of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was higher in the rt-PA treated groups. The results determine possible clinical or neuroradiological predictors of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with rt-PA therapy.
