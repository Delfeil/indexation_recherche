Hospitalized chemotherapy treatment of mammary cancer costs ca. 2000 DM. These costs are not covered by the forms of compensation available to university hospitals in Germany, namely billing treatment on a lump sum basis per outpatient case (Poliklinikpauschale) or at the inpatient flat rate per day of patient stay (Abteilungs- und Basispflegesatz). The authors propose negotiating a cost-covering rate for day patient care with health insurance companies as a solution. This would offer the health insurance companies savings on cytostatics (antitumor agents), using the resources of the hospitals' pharmacies instead of private pharmacies on a prescription basis.
