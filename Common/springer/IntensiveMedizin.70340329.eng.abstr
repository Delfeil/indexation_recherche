 Longstanding diagnostic and therapeutic management concepts in critical care medicine have to be reevaluated in the context of quality control. The following presentation of the "Lidocaine-Story" could serve as an example: in the seventies and eighties Lidocaine was prophylactically administered to patients with acute coronary heart disease (CHD), when so-called "warning arrhythmias" (precursors of life threatening rhythm disturbances) appeared; the value of such a prophylaxis remained uncertain although in worldwide use. Later, the measurement of the lidocaine concentration in plasma and the forecasting of individualized dosage became available. However, the significance of this form of managing ventricular arrhythmias was difficult to prove, especially, because of the decrease in the frequency of life threatening arrhythmias during the years of up-coming reperfusion therapies. In a controlled study we intended to further clarify: 1) the question of the significance of "warning arrhythmias" and 2) the value of the concept of lidocaine prophylaxis in the future, including the expending form of differentiated arrhythmia monitoring.
