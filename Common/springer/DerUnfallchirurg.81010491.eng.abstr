In this article we report a case of an early postoperative compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial compartment with complete sensomotoric palsy of the peroneal nerve after arthroscopic-assisted replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee. The tourniquet pressure was 360 mm Hg and operation time was 1.75 h. After the operation the leg was bandaged to avoid swelling of the leg and as antithrombotic prophylaxis. Analgesic therapy was by continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion. Increasing pain of the lower leg was suppressed by additional analgesia. Due to persistent pain despite regular analgesia, the patient was sent to a main hospital on the 3rd postoperative day, where an extremely painful and swollen anterior tibial compartment with intracompartimental pressure of over 100 mm Hg was found. The compartment was released immediately. Despite the appearance of severe muscle damage, no extensive débridement was done. At the second examination, at 48 h, there was minimal perfusion of the muscles without contraction and islands of ischemic necrosis. Clinically, there was complete palsy of the dorsiflexors of the foot. The case shows the danger of a compartment syndrome when tourniquet of the limb, arthroscopy and a firm bandage are combined. Continuous epidural analgesia masks the classic symptoms of compartment syndrome.
