  An ecological theory of remembering is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment. The specific ecological relationship to the environment is affinitive, and also opens access to the ressources of the past. In the present study, conditions for this access (in particular with older people) were investigated. It is assumed that older people, especially, when they lose someone with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment, such as moving to a home, are rejected by older people. These hypotheses were checked on the basis of material (N=120) gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed. To make matters clear, "typical" and thus every-day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material. Finally, practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged.
