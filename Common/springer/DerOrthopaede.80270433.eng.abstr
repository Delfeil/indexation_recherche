To date, every attempt to bridge neural defects with nerve prostheses has failed. Silicone tubes, polyglactides, caprolactones and other compounds containing polyglactin have not solved the basic problems of nerve regeneration. The profound rejection responses to foreign matter cause destruction of the ultrastructural units that are imperative for the regeneration of neurites. Positive results obtained with animal experiments have not withstood clinical testing since inferior regenerative performance can occur despite obstructed regenerative pathways.
