Genetic deficiency of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex causes hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy. Enteroviruses can also cause cardiomyopathy and we have recently described a potential molecular mechanism for enterovirus-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. The coxsackieviral protease 2A proteolytically cleaves and functionally impairs dystrophin. Additionally, during infection with coxsackievirus B3, the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex becomes disrupted and the sarcolemmal integrity is lost.
