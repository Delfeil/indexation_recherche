 Depression and fibromyalgia (FM) share common symptoms, indicating a close relationship between both disorders. FM patients frequently present symptoms of major depression. Genetic epidemiological studies show that genetic transmission is one important component. Molecular genetic studies are on the way; the serotonin transporter promoter gene seems to be associated with neurotic anxiety and FM. Biochemical studies related to the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are disturbed in both disorders. This view is supported by the response to treatment with antidepressants.
