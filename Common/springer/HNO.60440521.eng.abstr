Klippel-Feil syndrome is characterized by a short-neck and a low occipital hairline due to such deformaties of the cervical spine as aplasia, dysplasia and fusions of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae. Approximately 1/3 of cases have sensorineural deafness, although occasional unilateral or bilateral conductive hearing loss due to middle ear malformations have been described.
