The present state of in-patient psychoanalytic therapy is discussed from the view-point of the author's consulting and supervisory experiences. Following Janssen's integrated model of in-patient therapy difficulties to implement psychoanalytic principles are described, their reasons identified and ways of overcoming by a solution oriented psychoanalytic-systemic approach delineated. The one-sided deficiency orientation of the psychodynamic diagnostic approaches and the subsequent under-evaluation of solution oriented suggestive modes of intervention are disclosed as main reasons of the difficulties concerned. Then the main principles of a solution oriented psychoanalytic-systemic in-patient-therapy are described. It is demonstrated how this approach may overcome the difficulties of communication and cooperation within the therapy-teams and in the team-patients-interactions.
