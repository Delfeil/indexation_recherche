The physician's duty of professional discretion is one of the basic tenets at the heart of the doctor's profession. It is laid down in the physicians' professional code and determined ultimately by the patient's right to self-determination, which is regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code. It is established in the ordinance governing physicians' work and has its origin in the patient's right of self-determination. It is also regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code. An exception can be made to the duty of professional secrecy if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law. Some such exceptions are also specified in the German Social Code, although the physician's duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated, particularly when medical data in the strictest sense of the phrase are concerned. Borderline cases are described to illustrate how the rules of professional medical discretion are breached in the course of day-to-day business transacted between the statutory accident insurance firms and the physicians under contract to them, and some hints are given on how this can be avoided.
