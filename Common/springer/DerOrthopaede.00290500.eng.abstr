The treatment of idiopathic scoliosis over 40  ° (Cobb) during the growth period is under discussion concerning the indication for conservative or surgical treatment. Curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity, vertebral rotation, rigidity of the curve, the skeletal age, the age and sex of the patient, the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve. In scoliosis over 40  ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period. Progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major scolioses, especially in young patients (Risser sign 0 and 1).
