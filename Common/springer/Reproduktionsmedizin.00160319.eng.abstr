In Germany about 1 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis B or C virus and most of them are in the reproductive age. If a child is desired, liver function and moreover sexual and materno-fetal risk of transmission should be taken into consideration. Active vaccination can prevent sexual transmission of HBV and simultaneous passive vaccination strategies are able to inhibit consecutive infection of the newborn. Perinatal aquired chronic hepatitis B is typically asymptomatic and shows good short term prognosis. In men with chronic HBV infection transmission of the virus to the fetus by the infected sperm cannot fully be excluded. In HCV infection no successful vaccination strategies are available yet and preventing sexual transmission is based on condom use. Assisted reproduction techniques can reduce the risk of male to female transmission. HCV transmission to the newborn depends on maternal viral load. Perinatal aquired chronic hepatitis C shows a good prognosis. Prior to assisted reproduction antiviral treatment should be considered.
