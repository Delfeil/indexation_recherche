We report about a new type of physical therapy which can be used in patients with joint immobility secondary to by chronic venous insufficiency. Biomechanical stimulation therapy (BMS) uses mechanical vibration of standardised frequencies from 18-35 Hz spectrum to expose the feet and legs to longitudinal mechanical stimuli. Therapeutic benefit and clinical improvement can be achieved after a short period of treatment. We describe a 76 year old female patient suffering from both impaired motion and recurrent venous ulceration due to chronic venous insufficiency. After 10 days treatment with BMS, mobility of upper ankle joints improved by 16 degrees and 19 degrees and was accompained by healing of venous ulcerations after skin flap transplantation. Biomechanical stimulation methods were developed in the former Sowiet Union where they were used in sports medicine to improve relaxation of strained muscle structures and to increase the stretching ability of capsules and tendons. We have successfuly treated 6 patients with impaired mobility and chronic venous insufficiency. We believe that BMS is lialy to become a valuable therapeutic tool in patients with this problem in the near future.
