Infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance. For internal control, they may only be used under the condition of homogeneous data collection and evaluation according to identical standard operating procedures during the entire investigation period. For inter-hospital comparison, they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable. A survey of the infection rates published during the last 6 years in the German traumatological literature (n = 71) indeed shows (concerning series later than 1985) similar infection rates for procedures in less and in more problematic anatomical regions and in clean and contaminated situations of about 2 - 3%, after open injuries sporadically max. 10%. Finally, it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general "risk of infection" based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa. We strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection. The differentiation between deep and superficial infection should be abandoned. For all mentioned "infection rates" it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement.
