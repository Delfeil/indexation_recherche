 The expansion of minimally invasive surgery worldwide provokes an intensive interest of all surgical disciplines in gaining possibilities for research, learning and teaching by operating on human corpses. Despite the fact that German anatomical institutes in general have the infrastructure to realise such clinical cooperations, at present they may offer such opportunities only to a restricted degree, since the concentration on student teaching and anatomic research limits the capacity of the staff for a commitment in this field of applied science. To provide a basis for future estimations of the efforts necessary to perform solo surgery on the human cadaver, especially with emphasis on research, quality control and teaching, this article reports on practical experiences with such a project named "ANAtoMIC", identifying minimal conditions which have to be realised.
