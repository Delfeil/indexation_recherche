Aquajogging consists of simulated running in deep water aided by a flotation device (vest or belt) that maintains the head above water. In sports, Aquajogging is used as a training for regeneration or a low impact training alternative. In rehabilitation Aquajogging is well used in rheumatology diseases, in the pre- and postoperative management of musculoskeletal diseases and in endurance and power training in cardiorespiratory diseases.
