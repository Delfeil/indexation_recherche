 Coronary artery occlusion followed by myocardial infarction in the setting of nonpenetrating chest trauma is extremely rare. Before the advent of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), the only treatment option for coronary artery occlusion after chest trauma was supportive therapy or coronary artery bypass grafting. We report a case of myocardial infarction after occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA), presumably due to a dissection of the proximal segment.   A previously healthy 36 year old man without risk factors of coronary heart disease was involved in a car accident and subsequently admitted to the emergency ward with a blunt chest trauma. On day four, the ECG showed signs of posterior myocardial infarction. The left ventricular posterior wall was akinetic on echocardiography. Due to these echocardiographic findings and ECG changes, a coronary angiography was performed which showed an angiographically normal left coronary artery. However, the RCA was dissected shortly after its origin. RCA revascularization was achieved by PTCA and stenting of the dissected segment with a good angiographic result. The subsequent clinical course was uneventful.
