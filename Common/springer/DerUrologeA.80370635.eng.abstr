Improved survival in testicular cancer has been accompanied by concern about long-term side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Secondary malignant neoplasia represents one of the worst possible long-term complications, leading to death in patients cured of their primary malignancy. Patients with testicular germ cell tumors appear to have a 2-fold increased risk of developing any second cancer 25-30 years after the diagnosis, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 16-23 % at that time. The risk for secondary solid tumors can be mainly attributed to radiotherapy. There is strong evidence of an increasing risk for secondary solid tumors with time since treatment. Tumor-specific analysis of the risk for second cancers revealed statistically significant excesses for stomach, pancreas, bladder, rectum, prostate, and kidney cancer, as well as for cancer of the thyroid, melanoma, sarcomas, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. No significantly elevated risk for secondary solid tumors was observed after treatment with chemotherapy alone.
