We report the case of a 62-year-old woman with marked valgus and limitation of extension of the right knee joint as the result of a supracondylar fracture of the femur, originally treated by internal fixation with a dynamic condylar screw. Two years later, revision osteotomy with retrograde femoral nailing was carried out to achieve varisation and improve extension. Within a week of operation the patient's right leg was fully weight bearing with normal axial positioning. A retrograde locking nail provides satisfactory and stable internal fixation in cases of revision.
