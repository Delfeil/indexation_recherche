Purpose: This study was conducted to control improvement in the high preoperative prevalence of TMJ symptoms in patients treated by long-term orthodontic therapy for class II malocclusion. Patients and methods: A total of 57 patients were examined at least 8 years after surgery, 37 having received orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery and 20 surgery but without orthodontic treatment. Myofunctional, disk and condylar symptoms were recorded according to the Krough-Poulsen scheme. Results: Both groups showed a normal maximal interincisal distance. The deviation during the opening movement was mainly sigmoidal in the group with orthodontic treatment and terminal in the other group. Muscular pain predominated in the group without orthodontic treatment. Clicking sounds of the TMJ were registered in 70% of both groups. Occlusal interference and a higher interocclusal distance when speaking were found more often in patients without orthodontic treatment. Preoperatively, clicking and crepitation sounds had been recorded in 60% of both patients groups. Conclusion: In conclusion, a high postoperative prevalence of TMJ dysfunction symptoms was found in patients with class II malocclusion 8-10 years after orthognathic surgery with or without orthodontic treatment. Both groups often exhibited TMJ clicking and crepitation sounds, whereas the patients that had not received orthodontic treatment had a higher prevalence of occlusal interference and muscular pain.
