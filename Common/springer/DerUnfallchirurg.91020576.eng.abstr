The calcaneus is a uncomon site for a unicameral solitary bone cyst. However, because of the concentration of forces through the heel, such solitary bone cysts are usually symptomatic, depending on the proximity to the joint and the size of the cyst and therefore require in most cases surgical treatment. This is a report about two patients with a solitary bone cyst of the os calcis in 1996 and 1997. The diagnosis was confirmed radiologically and histologically. The standard therapie in both cases was the curretage of the cyst by packing the defect with bone graft from the pelvis. The author reviewed the literature concerning ethiology, diagnosis and treatment of unicameral solitary bone cysts of the calcaneus. The diagnosis cannot be based solely on radiological findings because of the variation of solitary bone cysts and the special forms, such as calcifying solitary bone cysts. Therefore exact histological diagnosis is of particular importance.
