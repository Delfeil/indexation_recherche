The AGA shoulder-dislocation study is a prospective multicenter study with many cases (371 stabilization operations), which has not terminated yet. One of the main aims of the study is the standardization of intraoperative findings within the unstable shoulder using a modified scheme from Habermeyer. Another aim is to judge the unstable shoulder by viewing the structure of IGHL, MGHL, and the incidence and extension of a Hill-Sachs lesion.
