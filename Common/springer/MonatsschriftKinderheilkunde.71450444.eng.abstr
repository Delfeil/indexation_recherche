Aims: To investigate the influence of population definitions, population drop-outs and lack of a case-control design on estimates of the prevalence of adverse outcome in high risk children (i. e. very preterm infants).  Method: Prospective study of all infants born < 32 weeks gestation (N: 560) between 1. 2. 1985-31. 3. 1986 in South Bavaria (FRG). 77.7 % of survivors (308/396) were investigated at 4.8 years, and paediatrician's reports collected and telephone interview conducted with the dropouts (67/88). Comparison groups included a matched fullterm control group (N: 308) and a respresentative sample of Bavarian same-aged peers (norm sample, N: 432). Peri-, neonatal, sociodemographic, neurological and developmental test data (Griffiths test, CMM) were assessed prospectively (neonatally, 5, 20 and 56 months of age).  Results: Populations varied widely between hospitals, even in the same region, with regard to peri- and neonatal complications, sociodemographic variables and mortality. Follow-up results of one clinic (e. g. University centre) are not representative for results of a region. Parents with low education, single and non-German speakers or those with an handicaped child were more likely to be lost from follow-up. Standard cognitive test norms were found to be outdated. Twice as many very preterms were found to suffer major intellectual impairment (< -2 SD; 25.4 %) when compared to same-aged peers than to the testnorms (13.5 %).  Conclusions: Only few outcome studies of very preterm infants as reported in the literature comply with minimal design standards. Mono-centre studies (e. g. University centres), missing correction for social factors, lack of documentation of drop-outs and reliance on test norms rather than control groups lead to under-estimations (2-3 times) of developmental deficits in high risk samples. The socially most disadvantaged preschool children may also be lost from routine health monitoring more often, and if clinically compared to outmoded testnorms are often wrongly diagnosed as developing normally and thereby often lose the chance of early appropriate intervention.
