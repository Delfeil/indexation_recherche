Purpose: To determine the value of gadolinium-enhanced, three-dimensional breathhold Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) in the assessment of the aorta and renal arteries in comparison to conventional arteriography (CA). Patients and methods: 49 patients were evaluated with both CA and 3D MRA. 0.3 mmol/kg BW gadolinium-DTPA was administered intravenously in a bolus, using an automated injector. A test bolus method was used for timing of the bolus and beginning of the data acquisition. The intraarterial CA was used as the gold standard. Results: MRA-based assessment of renal artery stenosis was identical with CA in 31 of 45 stenoses (68.8 %). Sensitivity and specificity for assessment of renal arterial disease by MRA were 84 % and 96 %; for clinically relevant lesions they amounted to 90 % and 98 %. Conclusion: The presented contrast-enhanced 3D MRA technique allows for the reliable assessment of renal arterial morphology and pathology.
