  Background: Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) grafting without cardipulmonary bypass (CPB) through an anterolateral minithoracotomy has become a promising therapeutical option especially in multimorbid, elderly and reoperative patients with single vessel disease. However, this procedure precludes complete revascularization in multivessel disease because the minithoracotomy limits the surgical access either to anterior or lateral or posterior vessels of the beating heart. To expand the benefits of the MIDCAB concept to patients with multivessel disease, new interdisciplinary approaches have recently been introduced.
