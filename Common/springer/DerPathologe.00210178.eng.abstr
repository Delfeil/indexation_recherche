Large B-cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non-Hodgkin-lymphomas (30-40%). They are characterised by an aggressive clinical course. These lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma. In addition to primary nodal, a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common. The neoplastic cells, even within one given case, show a broad morphological spectrum. Several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large B-cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group. This fact has been taken into account by the new WHO classification of malignant lymphomas. There are two groups identified, that of the variants and that of the subtypes. The various variants (centroblastic, immunoblastic, anaplastic, T-cell/histiocyte-rich) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical, immunophenotypical and genetic findings. In contrast, the primary mediastinal, the intravascular, the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities. A number of recently described large cell lymphoma types, i. e. plasmablastic, ALK-positive and primary gastric, are included in the classification, their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion.
