Bioabsorbable implants have been advocated for use in arthroscopic repair of unstable shoulders. These implants have been thought to be safe and to have few adverse effects. However, similar implants have been shown to cause nonspecific granulomatous reactions when implanted into bone or soft tissues in studies in both animals and human beings. This retrospective study reports the adverse effects of these implants in five patients who had arthroscopic repair of unstable shoulder. All patients reported increasing pain and loss of shoulder motion, following a symptom-free interval of an average of 2 weeks after insertion of these devices. Two of them required a further arthroscopic lavage and de-bridement to reduce the intracapsular synovitis. Granulomatous reactions were identified histologically in all cases. Three patients were treated conservatively. In all cases an open Bankart repair was required after recurrent dislocation within 1 year.
