Abstract  Objectives: The paO2 and AaDO2 are routinely measured for evaluating pulmonary gas exchange. The normal value of the AaDO2 amounts 10 mmHg when breathing atmospheric air and is said to increase with rising FIO2. This increase is discussed controversially. One possible reason for incongruities in AaDO2 measurement may be the impact of so called preanalytical errors during paO2 measurement, which are often neglected. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relevance of preanalytical errors on the AaDO2 under hyperoxic conditions.
