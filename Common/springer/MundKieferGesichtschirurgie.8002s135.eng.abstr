The aim of this study was the evaluation of a newly developed radiotranslucent headholder (craniostat) in order to improve diagnosis of maxillofacial pathology. In this prospective study, 103 patients with maxillofacial pathology were examined preoperatively with a Philips SR 7000 computed tomograph using this craniostat. The apparatus was applied fixing the patient's head at three points (meatus acusticus externus on both sides and the glabella). The control group consisted of 106 patients with similar pathology who were examined by computed tomography without a headholder. The application of the craniostat resulted in the following advantageous findings: (1) reproducible CT scans, therefore very precise assessment of the course of a disease; (2) fewer motion artifacts; and (3) symmetrical posture of the patient's head. This headholder is helpful in improving maxillofacial diagnosis by computed tomography if a symmetrical, reproducible posture of the patient's head is to be achieved and motion artifacts could otherwise make the interpretation of the resulting images much more difficult.
