During MRI-controlled resection of brain tumors using an open MRI system, operation-induced alterations may occur, especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall. This may simulate tumor areas, resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non-tumorous areas. Based on 42 MRI- and biopsy-controlled brain tumor resections in an 0.5 T open MRI (Signa SP, GE), the appearance and origin of operation-induced reactions are analyzed. In our opinion, there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation-induced microcontusions. The beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10-15 min. MRI-controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist allows discrimination of operation-induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation.
