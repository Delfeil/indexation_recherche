The use of cytotoxic therapy in metastatic breast cancer is an effective, but quite toxic measure compared to other available treatment options. The decision for or against chemotherapy should take into account the patient, condition and the goals of the therapy. Aggressive therapies provide good remission rates and are suitable for patients with symptomatic disease and good performance status. Monotherapies are advantageous regarding tolerability and can often be conducted for a long time as consolidating therapy. Several new substances are efficient in breast-cancer patients and should be evaluated for further clinical use in future studies.
