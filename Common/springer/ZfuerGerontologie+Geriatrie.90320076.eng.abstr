  Chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons, expecially in hippocampus, by which the degree of damage differs in various species. Sapolski has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration, disturbed feed-back reaction, and hypersecretion of glucocorticoids. The aim of this study was to investigate if the signal transmission via glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the brain of male wistar rats of two age groups (5-6 and 17-24 months, respectively) is changed in aging and which cytoplasmic factors/modulators participate in this process.
