The public perception of the importance of environmental factors for carcinogenesis was investigated in a representative sample of Austrians (n=2073) who in 1995 were >=15 years of age. Results show that about 60% of the respondents attribute great importance to environmental pollution as a cause for cancer development. Only smoking ranks higher. Approximately 56% of the respondents rate toxic agents in the workplace to be of great importance. In the case of pesticide residues this is true for 50% and in the case of passive smoking for 44%. High voltage power lines, 'earth rays' and 'water veins' are rated to be of great importance by about 25% of the respondents. The ratings of women and men do not differ except for the last two esoteric factors, with women giving more importance to them. The survey shows that the role of environmental factors in cancer development is overestimated. A better information of the public about the various cancer risks seems to be necessary. It should be based on the recommendations concerning risk communication, risk didactics and risk comparisons.
