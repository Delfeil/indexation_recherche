Pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by a massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction. It is rarely after hip surgery, however, untreated it may be complicated by a life threatening perforation of the colon. In a retrospective analysis we reviewed 11 patients (4 women, 7 men, mean age 75.2 years, range 67 to 86 years) with pseudo-obstruction of the colon after hip surgery in the years 1995 to 1998. In relation to all patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery of the hip, the prevalence was 1.06%. The leading clinical symptom was abdominal distension. On plain x-rays, dilatation of the colon measured 13.3 cm on average (9-16 cm). In two patients (18%) adaequate application of drugs stimulating the gastro-intestinal motility was sufficient, whereas in 8 patients (73%) colonoscopic decompression had to be performed. In three of these, the procedure failed and because of persistent symtoms a coecostomy was performed. One patient underwent immediate laparotomy because of peritonitis. 2 patients (18%) died because of a complicated course. Non operative treatment should not exceed 24 hours, endoscopic decompression and tube placement is considered as the treatment of choice. In cases of failure of these procedures, perforation of the colon and/or peritonism, urgent laparotomy with open decompression by a coecostomy is essential.
