Background and purpose: Without recanalisation, acute basilar artery (BA) occlusion has a mortality of 90 %, which is reduced to 50 % if recanalisation is achieved. Fast diagnosis of BA occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay. We wanted to assess the role of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected acute BA occlusion.
