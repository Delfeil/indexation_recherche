Diagnostics of developmental speech- and language disorders is based primarily on the criteria severity of involvement and pattern. Regarding phonological disorders single word articulation tests are widely used because of efficiency considerations. However they are insufficient for ICD-10 diagnostics, because severity of involvement and pattern are influenced from the fact that children are spontaneously talking or giving single word responses. "Percentage of Consonants Correct (PCC)" and "Percentage of Consonants Correct for early, middle and late consonants" are described as an articulation competence metric, whereas "Natural Process Analysis" is proposed to describe the pattern of the disorder. Three case studies are used to outline the methods. Data show that "Percentage of Consonants Correct" is a good metric to index severity of involvement and "Natural Process Analysis" is a prerequisite to describe the pattern of the disorder.
