  We describe a case-report on an perforation of an aorto-coronary venous bypass-graft, a complication induced by a stent implantation. Perforations of coronary arteries are rare, however, for interventional cardiologists well-known complications. This case report is of special interest (1) because the perforation did not occur in a coronary artery but rather in an eight year old venous bypass graft and (2) because the perforation was induced by a stent-implantation. In addition, this case-report describes in great detail the management of vessel perforation: several invasive methods contributed to minimize pericardial effusion and to stabilize the patient until surgical revision could be performed.
