 In 70 patients a catheter was implanted in the popliteal fossa for repetitive block of the sciatic nerve in order to treat ischemic pain of the leg. At variable, individually determined time intervals of 4 - 12 h doses of 10 ml bupivacaine 0.25% or 0.5% were administered to 66 patients. In 4 patients a higher volume was injected. Good or excellent analgesia was obtained in 93%. Motoric deficits were seen in 2 of 3 patients. Improvement in perfusion caused by the blocking of sympathetic fibers was noticed in 5 of 17 patients. Technical complications occurred more often than with epidural regional techniques. The block of the popliteal sciatic nerve is of low risk and easy to perform. It is an effective alternative for symptomatic treatment of ischemic pain of the foot and lower leg.
