Gangliocytomas or gangliogliomas of the sellar region are very rare tumors. In a great proportion of those cases an adenoma of the anterior pituitary develops from the cell type that is hyperstimulated by the releasing hormone produced from the gangliocytoma. Five GHRH secreting gangliocytomas are reported. Four of these were localized adjacent to a GH secreting adenoma. In one case, no adenoma tissue was found beside the ganglicytoma. As only the adenomas can secrete GH, the adenomas and not the gangliocytomas are directly responsible for acromegaly so that such an adenoma has to be present in cases of acromegaly. A CRH secreting gangliocytoma was combined with an ACTH cell adenoma that had induced Cushing's disease. A ganglioglioma of the posterior pituitary had led to an inappropriate secretion of Vasopressin. The morphology of the different tumors is presented.
