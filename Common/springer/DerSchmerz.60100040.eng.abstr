 A patient with brachialgia was admitted to a surgical clinic and a cervical nerve block was performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Acute severe cervical pain prevented completion of the procedure. On the following day the patient developed incomplete paralysis of both legs and arms and was transferred to a neurosurgical department for further diagnosis and therapy. The CT scan showed a space-occupying cervical intraspinal haematoma, which was removed immediately as far as possible by a dorsal approach. Postoperatively little improvement of neurologic function was noticed, and 11 days after the event the patient died from a massive pulmonary embolism despite intense resuscitation efforts.
