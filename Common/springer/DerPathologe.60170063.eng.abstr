Analysis of 402 solitary bone cysts demonstrates the wide morphological variation of this cystic lesion with regard to histology and radiology. Aside from metaphyseal location in femur (33 %) and humerus (23 %), solitary bone cysts are also often located in calcaneus (11 %), tibia (11 %) and pelvis (10 %). Most patients are in the second decade of life. Differentiation between this benign lesion and malignant bone tumors is very important in daily clinical routine. The diagnosis cannot be based solely on radiological findings because of the variation of solitary bone cysts and the special forms, such as calcifying solitary bone cyst. Therefore, exact histological diagnosis is of particular importance.
