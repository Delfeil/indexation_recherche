For both VFR and as IFR flight, visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot. The new possibilities for change of refraction by means of corneal refractive surgery have led to an increasing demand from pilots for these new methods. Can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes? The valid regulations for medical standards of pilots, as well as the future international regulations such as JAR and ICAO, are explained in this respect. A report is given on the work of the Advisory Board of the German Federal Government Air Traffic Authority and on the cases treated so far and their outcome, and recommendations are expressed. Concerning the legal situation and clinical experience, advice for pilots, aviation medical examiners and ophthalmologists is given.
