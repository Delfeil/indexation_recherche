Oncocytomas are rare epithelial tumors of the major and minor salivary glands. Reported is an oncocytoma of the lateral wall of the left nasal cavity in a 60-year-old man. Because of its locally invasive character, with rupture into the left nasal cavity and partial dedifferentiation with loss of typically oncocytic features, we classified the tumor as oncocytoma of low malignant potential.
