Abstract.  The contribution of Rudolf Virchow to dermatology seems to have been forgotten, or present-day dermatologists are not aware of it. The present historical review is intended to show that Virchow's thoughts and the terminology created by him are still alive. The report encompasses a short biography, including Virchow's nonmedical activities. It starts with early experimental publications, which laid to the foundation for his fame, and with dermatological studies of his early period. This is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work, "Cellularpathologie". Special mention is made of Virchow's lasting contributions to medical, and particularly dermatological, terminology. Finally, his historical studies, his latter small publications on topics in dermatology, his pupils and scientific friends, and the social-political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed. Thus, a multifaceted picture is painted of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways.
