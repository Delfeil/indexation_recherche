Today lumbar spinal stenosis can stand on its own as a clinical entity that can be radiologically and clinically divided into central and lateral stenosis. Foraminal stenosis is a special form of the latter. During the period 1990-1991 we operated on 148 patients for spinal stenosis. Using a standardized questionnaire, 109 patients were evaluated on their pain and gait status 3 years after the operation. Patients with previously known spondylolisthesis or degenerative instability were excluded from the study. Forty-four out of 109 patients were free of pain, while significant reduction of pain was noted in 35/109 patients. In 19 patients, the pain remained the same or worsened postoperatively. Seventy-four out of the 109 patients had no gait disturbances, whereas only 14/109 worsened postoperatively. Six patients could walk with support and seven patients were unable to walk because of other disturbances. Because of unclear responses, the status of the remaining patients could not be completely evaluated in either group.
