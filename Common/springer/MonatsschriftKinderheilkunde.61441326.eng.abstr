Objective: Chronic recurrent abdominal pain in childhood is frequently due to a Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis. The diagnosis should be verified either by gastric biopsy culture or by histological investigations of the gastric mucosa in children. The gastroscopy necessary for this often requires general anesthesia. The purpose of the present study was to etablish whether an ELISA for Helicobacter pylori has an adequate predictive reliability with regard to the putative gastric histology in order to possibly prevent unnecessary biopsies and associated anesthesias.
