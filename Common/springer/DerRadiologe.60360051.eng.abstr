Ultrasound contrast agents have recently proven to be clinically useful in many different areas and with many different ultrasound modalities. B-mode contrast echocardiography and delineation of cavities with ultrasound contrast agents are already accepted. Based on the contrast agent Echovist, assessment of tubal patency is possible with hysterosalpingo contrast sonography (HyCoSy). A new generation of transpulmonary, stable ultrasound contrast agents such as Levovist offer potential for various Doppler applications. Ultrasound contrast agents act as signal enhancers in Doppler examinations and therefore help to overcome the limitations of insufficient Doppler signal intensity. Recently, clinical studies have shown. Doppler examinations to have many clinical benefits. Contrast agents are useful in the assessment of high-grade stenosis or the delineation of small vessels and under difficult conditions. Ultrasound contrast agents also create new applications: analysis of tumor vascularization and delineation of the transcranial venous system are possible with contrast enhancement. Future developments in contrast-specific scanning ("harmonic imaging") and new contrast agents, including organ-specific contrast agents, are expected to make a significant impact in the years to come.
