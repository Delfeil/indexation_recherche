In this study we describe 22 cases of retrograde ureteral stent placement in pregnant women with therapy-resistant flank pain due to hydronephrosis. Eleven were primiparous and one patient expected twins. Eight of 22 patients presented symptoms of pyelonephritis. In 21 cases the hydronephrosis was located on the right and in 4 cases it was bilateral. Maximal lower calix diameter was 12 mm (range 9-22 mm). With the exception of two cases, sonographically controlled stent placement was performed under local anesthesia without sedation. All patients were painfree within 6 days and were given prophylactic low dosis of antibiotic until the day of delivery. Renal function remained within the normal limits. Double-J stent displacement occured in 3 patients - of which one underwent nephrostomy. Postnatal examination demonstrated urolithiasis in 4 of 19 patients. This study provides evidence for effectiveness of retrograde ureteral Double-J stent placement as a therapeutic option in cases of severe symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy with a low morbidity rate.
