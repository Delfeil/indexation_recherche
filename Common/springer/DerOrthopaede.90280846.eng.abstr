Fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social-economic relevance. For treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards. The demand for stable osteosynthesis of A3-, B2-B3 and C1-C2-fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting, even for the elder patient. The isolated external fixation with K-wires represent special situation. Supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development.
