A 26-year old patient who suffered from purpura for four years evolved into the complete clinical picture of Henoch-Schönlein-purpura in the past two years. A causative agent was never found. Multiple therapeutic approaches including systemic steroids, azathioprine as well as pentoxyfylline failed to control the arthralgias, intestinal symptoms and skin lesions. Therefore dapsone therapy was initiated at a dosage of 100 mg daily after checking the glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase and with regular control of the blood methemoglobin level. Within two weeks, the patient's symptoms completetly cleared, he has now been in remission for the past six months. As noted elsewhere, dapsone is an effective therapy for severe cases of Henoch-Schönlein- purpura.
