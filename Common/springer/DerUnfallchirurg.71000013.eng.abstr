During the war period 1991-1992 in Croatia, ten wounded children (16 years of age or younger) with war injuries to the brain were admitted to the Division of Neurosurgery, Osijek Clinical Hospital. Six of them had been wounded by shrapnel and four by pistol or rifle bullets. All but one were managed surgically (i.e. by craniotomy). The outcome was: as follows three children had a good recovery, four retained a moderate neurological deficit, and three died (injured by shrapnel). Five of the wounded (four injured by shrapnels and one by bullets) had associated injuries (fractures of the leg bones, eye lesion, amputation of the right leg) which influenced morbidity, and in one case mortality. Children wounded with shrapnel had brain edema on admission to hospital. Our experience indicates that the thermal effect from heated shrapnel, as well as velocity, mass, size and shape of the shrapnel, could be an additional factor for the development of severe brain edema.
