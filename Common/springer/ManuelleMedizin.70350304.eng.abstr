Although the anatomy of the spinal column and the functional interactions of its musculature are well known, there are still serious questions concerning pathogenesis and therapy of chronic backache. To shed light on the interaction of muscles and joints of the thoracic and lumbar spinal column we investigated 95 cases of lumbar and 18 cases of thoracic joint blockage before and after induction of anaesthesia. During anaesthesia and muscle relaxation only 70 out of 95 lumbar and 15 out of 18 thoracic blockages could be found. In 20 cases of lumbar blockages having been disappeared during anaesthesia they were present again during recovery from anaesthesia. This means that there should be a sort of muscular dysfunction at least partly responsoble for some cases of joint blockage of the lumbar spinal column. In the majority of cases, however the problem has been addressed in the joint itself.
