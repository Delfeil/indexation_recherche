In spite of their tumor's origin in the uveal tract, many patients suffering from advanced uveal melanoma are admitted to dermatological oncology units. Most patients with metastases from uveal melanoma receive treatments that were established for stage IV cutaneous melanoma. However, both the biology as well as the metastastic behaviour of this tumor is different from cutaneous melanoma. Lymphatic metastases do not occur, and hematogeneous metastases usually occur later and predominantly involve the liver. The prognosis is very bad ranging from 2 to 5 months.
