We report a case of autosomal dominantly inherited dystonia and panic attacks to discuss successful treatment of a common serotonergic pathology with medication. The objective analysis of the movement disorder was done by Optotrak©. First we demonstrate a reduction of the myoclonus by L-5-hydroxytryptophan, which inhibits after 11 months. After changing the medication to Nefadozone, the myoclonus and the frequency of panic attacks were reduced.
