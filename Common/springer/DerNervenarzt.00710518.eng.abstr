Changes and growing uncertainty about the professional identity of Dutch psychiatrists can already be recognized in the early years following World War II. This is illustrated by a quotation from H. C. Rümke taken from his speech in 1954 entitled "A Flourishing Psychiatry in Danger." Thus the stage was set for the central theme of this article concerning the mental health care system typical for the Netherlands and the development of multidisciplinary teams. In anticipation of the present situation, some future prognoses are also mentioned from K. P. Kisker's "A Prognosis of Therapeutic Practice in Psychiatry" (German: "Prognose der psychiatrischen Therapeutik") of 1973 in the opening section as background to the question: from today's point of view and in the face of scientific developments threatening the field, how does the need for identity and continuity in psychiatry relate to social, sociopolitical, and cultural factors?
