Over the last decade mtDNA analysis has gained high importance for forensic identification casework, archeological research as well as for evolutionary and population genetic studies. The structure of the mitochondrial DNA is described with particular consideration of the non-coding hypervariable regions. Furthermore the importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolution biological investigations is discussed. The forensic value of the size and the stucture of sequence databases is underlined. Experimental studies dealing with mtDNA analysis of extracts from teeth, hair shafts and contaminated evidential material are presented. Finally three forensic criminal cases solved by mtDNA analysis are reported.
