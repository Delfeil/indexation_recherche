  We analyzed the incidence and management of major vascular complications at the arterial puncture site following diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization. 27387 cardiac catheterization procedures were performed for diagnostic (n = 19581) or interventional (n = 7806) purposed at our institution during a 7-year study period. A total number of 114 major vascular complications (0.42%) were identified.
