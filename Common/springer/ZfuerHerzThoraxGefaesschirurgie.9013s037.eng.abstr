 Background: Because of the controversial discussion, even with conservative specialities, the aim of the study was to show that the surgical treatment of pulmonary metastasis is an adequate therapy with low morbidity and mortality, good survival rates and an increasing quality of life. Methods:  From January 1982 until May 1992 we retrospectively reviewed all patients with pulmonary metastasis and completed follow-up until May 1995. Beside peri- and postoperative data we made a multivariant analysis to find the relevant prognostic factors and to define the survival rates. Results: Over a period of 10 years 73 patients underwent an operation for pulmonary metastasis. Follow-up was completed in 48 patients (21 female, 27 male). Median age was 47.4 years. Most primary tumors were adenocarcinoma of the colon (n=9), renal-cell-carcinoma (n=9), melanoma (n=6), osteosarcoma (n=5), and uterus carcinoma (n=5). There were 61 operations nessecary in the 48 patients. The procedure was a lateral thoracotomy in 93.4% and a median sternotomy in 6.6%. The surgical technique was a wedge resection in 67.2% and an anatomic resection in 31.2%. 62.5% of the patients had solitary metastasis, 22.9% had 2-4, and 14.6% had multiple metastasis. The median disease-free interval (DFI) of all patients was 24 months. 30 day-mortality was 1.1%; morbidity was 3.3%. Mean hospitalization time was 11 days. The 3-year-survival of all patients was 37.5%. The following relevant prognostic factors were found: site of primary tumor (p>0.05), number of metastasis (p<0.05), duration of DFI (p<0.05). There were significant differences in the 3-year-survival for adenocarcinomas of the colon (55.6%) and osteosarcoma (0%), in multiple (14.3%) and solitary metastasis (50%) as well as a DFI <2 years (29.2%) and >2 years (45.5%). There were no differences in spite of the surgical technique. Conclusions: Because of low mortality and morbidity, as well as good long-term results and without satisfying conservative treatments, the surgical treatment should be favored in pulmonary metastasis. It is a safe and sure therapy for the treatment of pulmonary metastasis.
