Nuchal fibroma is a fibrolipoma-like soft tissue mass, located on the back and neck of middle-aged men. Clinically it presents as adiffuse indurated subcutaneous swelling and, sometimes painful and inflamed. Since the first descriptions, by Enzinger and Weiss and Lister et al. both in 1988, under the name "collagenosis nuchae", only 15 additional cases have been reported. Nonetheless, the lesion is comparatively common. We report another case of nuchal fibroma enphaszing the distinctive clinical and histopathological features of this lesion and its differential diagnosis.
