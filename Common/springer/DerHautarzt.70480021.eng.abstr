Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (van Lohuizen) is a rare skin disease in newborn or very young children. From the dermatological point of view, therapy is either not necessary or uncomplicated. However, the dermatologist and/or the pediatrician need to search for possibly associated anomalies. Clinical characteristics of 15 patients examined in the Fachklinik Hornheide within the last 11 years are presented. By giving a survey of the anomalies associated with cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, we demonstrate the need  of neuropediatric, ophthalmologic and orthopedic examinations in addition the pedriatic and dermatologic examinations.
