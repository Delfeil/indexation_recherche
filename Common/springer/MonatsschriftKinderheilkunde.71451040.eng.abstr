The obstetrical palsy of the brachial plexus is a rare but severe complication in child delivery. If there is no spontaneous recovery within the first weeks, the child should be considered for a specialized diagnostic and treatment program with combined care from pediatricians, neurologists, and physiotherapists and surgeons. Right from the beginning physiotherapy is important with its general and specific exercises (Bobath, Vojta); but the decision for further conservative or surgical treatment should be made between 3nd and 6 month.
