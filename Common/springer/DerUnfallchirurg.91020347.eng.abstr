Introduction: The prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation, is especially in multi-system-trauma cases, recognized to be the "gold standard". Thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general, the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation, is becoming of increasing importance. Thereby we must take into consideration the limited possabilities, which are afflicted with a high degree of uncertainess, which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation. The purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients, was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings, to identify areas for procedural optimization.
