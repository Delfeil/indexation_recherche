 Following isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with TNF and melphalan the damage to muscle tissue and its systemic consequences in terms of myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria as well as the activation of the cytokine cascade were investigated. We measured the compartmental pressure of the limb during and after perfusion and determined the serum changes of myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, s-IL-2-receptor, TNF-receptor, and ICAM-1 levels. The compartmental pressure rose significantly during ILP and decreased after reperfusion. Following its course, the decision whether to perform a fasciotomy or not can be more reliably made. Serum myoglobin levels exceeded 200 times normal values and the increase occurred significantly earlier than that of CK, thus enabling judgement of the risk of renal failure (crush kidney syndrome). The elevation of serum IL-1 and IL-6 values correlated with the frequency of cardiopulmonary problems (hyperdynamic shock) and facilitated countermaneuvers. Our data, although obtained from ILP with TNF, could be used to monitor toxicity also when other drug regimens are administered.
