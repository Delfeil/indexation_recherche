In reconstruction of cartilage defects, autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method. Although a clinical application has not been reported until now, tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants. Nevertheless, in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms. Among other methods for in vivo tissue protection, the encapsulation with a semipermeable polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences. Human septal cartilage was encapsulated (group 1) with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of thymusaplastic nude mice. Cartilage implants without encapsulation (group 2) were used as control. Scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after implantation. Group 1 showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all. In contrast, group 2 presented, correlating to the time of implanta-tion, increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation, representing an increased activity of resorption. In conclusion, tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences. For the plastic-reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable.
