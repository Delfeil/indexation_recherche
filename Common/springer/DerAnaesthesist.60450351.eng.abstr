Acute renal failure (ARF) is a serious complication following liver transplantation. Many therapeutic regimens have been used so far but with limited success. Urodilatin (URO) is a new member of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) family. When administered intravenously, URO induces strong diuresis and natriuresis with tolerable hemodynamic side effects. Preliminary non-controlled clinical studies demonstrate beneficial effects using URO as a therapeutic agent in patients suffering from ARF following heart and liver transplantation (HTx, LTx). These results prompted us to initiate this first controlled clinical trial to investigate whether URO infusion can improve renal function in patients with emerging ARF following LTx.
