Background: Clonidine, an 2-receptor agonist, has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of spinally injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics.
