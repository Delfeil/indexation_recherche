The CO2 laser myringotomy is a current low-pain procedure for middle-ear ventilation for secretory otitis media (SOM) that can be performed under topical anesthesia, even in children. The duration of middle-ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created. Perforations with a diameter greater than 2 mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately 3 weeks, thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes. To date, the CO2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope. The CO2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system. The incorporation of a small inexpen-sive CO2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in SOM therapy.
