 A survey among coloproctologists was performed to assess current therapeutic concepts for the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease and anal fissure. A total of 261 clinical and non-clinical proctologists participated, representing the entire range of therapies in hospital and practise. A wealth of widely differing, in some aspects contradictory concepts were recorded, leaving almost no subject entirely undisputed. There are controversies regarding the different therapeutic alternatives as well as indications for surgery and choice of operative procedure. Future research has to address the existing controversies in order to reach a higher degree of standardization in the therapy of these common proctological disorders.
