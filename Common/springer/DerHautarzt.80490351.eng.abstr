The tumescent technique of local anesthesia was developed by J. Klein ten years ago to facilitate liposuction surgery. Tumescent anesthesia not only became the standard technique for liposuction, but proved to be of great value for other surgical problems in dermatology. Meanwhile, several noncosmetic uses for tumescent anesthesia were pioneered by dermatologic surgeons. This first review of the tumescent technique in German literature will focus on its specific advantages and disadvantages when applied in different fields of dermatologic surgery. Our own experience will be discussed, as well as future developments.
