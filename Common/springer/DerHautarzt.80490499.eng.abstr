The Comèl-Netherton syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease. A 23-year old female presented with the classical triad of ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, trichorrhexis invaginata with bamboo hairs of up to 12 cm length and atopic diathesis. Nevertheless, more than 20 years passed before the final diagnosis was established. In addition, the patient was slightly mentally retarded and suffered from a genital papillomatosis, minimal hypergammaglobulinaemia and a marked bilateral eyelid ectropion, more severe than previously reported. Oral therapy with Acitretin was quite successful.
