 Hernias of the obturator foramen are rare. They are described mostly in elderly female patients in poor health. Often the correct diagnosis is stumbled upon as a result of surprising intraoperative findings. Surgical therapy is indicated often by the clinical symptoms of an incarcerated hernia. Herniation of the entire urinary bladder with hemorrhagic infarction has never been described before. For an anatomical reduction of the hernia it was neccesary to resect the superior pubic ramus. For plastic reconstruction a marlex mesh was used.
