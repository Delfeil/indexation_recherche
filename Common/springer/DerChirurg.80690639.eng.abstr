 Hepatic involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is rare. Among local pathologic alterations like fibrosis and cirrhosis, arteriovenous shunts lead to hypercirculatory heart failure and require efficient therapy. Present therapeutic strategies consist of percutaneous selective embolization or complete ligation of the hepatic artery. We describe a 53-year-old woman with HHT in whom percutaneous selective embolization of the left hepatic artery failed because of unfavorable anatomy. Instead of ligation a new method of adjustable banding of the hepatic artery was tested. After small-incision laparotomy an expander prosthesis was put on the proper hepatic artery. By filling the prosthesis via the implanted port system the hepatic perfusion could be reduced under control. This method led to effective reduction of the liver perfusion and heart time volume and to successful treatment of heart failure. The method described is an alternative treatment to ligation of the hepatic artery in cases in which percutaneous embolization failed or is not possible.
