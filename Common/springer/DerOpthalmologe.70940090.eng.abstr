Many clinical studies have been performed investigating corneal endothelial cell loss after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods. Most studies, however, included variable follow-up intervals, neglecting the dynamic cell loss over the course of time. The aim of this study was to perform endothelial cell evaluation 5 years after penetrating keratoplasty using two different storage methods.
