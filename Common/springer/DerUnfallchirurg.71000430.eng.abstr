The final result of the treatment of distal intraarticular radius fractures depends both on the accuracy of the fracture reduction and on the presence or absence of additional carpal injuries. In particular, lesions of the intrinsic ligaments usually cause severe degenerative damage of the wrist joint if they are missed primarily. With the introduction of wrist arthroscopy these tears can be evaluated and treated earlier. Since 1993 arthroscopically assisted treatment has been performed in 23 patients with distal intraarticular fractures of the radius (mainly C fractures according to the AO classification system or group VII and VIII fractures according to Frykman). SL tears have been found in 11 patients (47.8%), 7 of whom showed marked instability and were stabilised at the time of surgery.
