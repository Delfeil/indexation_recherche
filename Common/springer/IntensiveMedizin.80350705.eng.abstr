 Thyrotoxicosis is not only able to aggravate preexisting cardiac disease but can also by itself lead to atrial fibrillation, cardiomegaly or congestive heart failure. In hyperthyreoidism, the total blood volume increases, the peripheral vascular resistence decreases, and cardiac failure may occur despite an increased cardiac output at rest. These changes can lead to "high output failure". This case report deals with severe congestive heart failure, dilatation of the left ventricle, and tachyarrhythmia without preexisting heart disease in a patient with Graves disease. Complete reversion of symptoms were seen during treatment. The special implications of cardiavascular pharmacotherapy, especially the risk of early -blocker therapy in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis with severe congestive heart failure are emphasized.
