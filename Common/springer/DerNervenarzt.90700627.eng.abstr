We investigated time use of persons assigned to seven groups on the basis of psychiatric diagnoses: (a) no dementia or depression symptoms, (b) individuals with dementia symptoms but no DSM-III-R-diagnosis, (c) individuals with dementia according to DSM-III-R, (d) individuals with depression symptoms but no diagnosis, (e) individuals with depression not further specified (NFS), (f) individuals with depression according to DSM-III-R, and (g) individuals with symptoms of both dementia and depression. In general, time-use parameters were similar across the groups. As expected, however, we found differences in specific dimensions. Demented and depressed individuals differed from others with respect to the duration of pas- sive phases and receptive leisure. Instrumental activities, active leisure, length of the waking day, and time spent alone were indicators with differential validity regarding dementia diagnoses - partly even after controlling for physical morbidity. Moreover, we were able to differentiate between dementia and depression on the basis of instrumental activities after controlling for physical morbidity.
