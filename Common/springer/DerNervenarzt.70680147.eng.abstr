Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a pain syndrome characterized by somatosensory and motor disturbances, as well as by autonomic and trophic changes. The term is used in a descriptive sense and does not imply specific mechanisms of pathogenesis. We report on a patient who fulfilled the clinical criteria of RSD and who also displayed increasing impairment of peripheral blood supply. Angiography revealed a circumscribed stenosis of the abdominal aorta adjacent to the bifurcation. Disturbances in peripheral circulation as a potential cause of RSD are discussed.
