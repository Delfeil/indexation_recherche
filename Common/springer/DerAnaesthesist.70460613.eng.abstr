The PhysioFlex anaesthesia machine is designed to operate as a quantitative closed system. The gas in the system is circulated at 70 litres per minute. With its small soda lime canister and the integration of all components in a thermal insulating case it fulfils all prerequisites for excellent climatisation of the anaesthetic gases. The extent of warming and humidifying of the anaesthetic gases was monitored during extended neurosurgical operations using long tubes to the patient (3 m each) in an cold operating room (17-18  °C).
