In assessing the consequences of a whiplash injury, an unbiased medical certification must explain to all those involved what happened as a result of the accident. To manage this, the expert first has to explain the medical course after the accident by using contemporary diagnosis. In a second step, the expert has to explain whether this diagnosis was the result of the accident or some other reason. Post-traumatic stress disorder might be a diagnosis that could explain some cases of late whiplash syndrome.
