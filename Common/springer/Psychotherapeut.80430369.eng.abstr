A psychodynamic concept for the treatment of severely structurally disturbed patients is presented. It has been developed from clinical practice and is designed for adoption in integration-oriented in-patient psychother-apy. Process features emerging during the individual therapeutic phases are described by the index category 'object relations. Par- ticular significance is attached to the detailed description of the therapeutical approach. Our newly developed relation-oriented model concepts of levels and phases in the ther-apeutical process may be used to classify  the multifaçeted phenomena in the treatment of severely structurally disturbed patients into standardised relations. The com-prehension of said standardised psychodynamic relations creates a large variety of prerequisites for constructive interventions, in particular in crises and stagnation in a therapeutical process and hence may improve treatment prognosis.
