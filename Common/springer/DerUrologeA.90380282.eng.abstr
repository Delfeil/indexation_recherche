Bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3,5 % of all testicular malignancies and to our knowlegde about 800 cases are reported in the literature. An even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non-germ cell tumor. We report the 6th case of such a coincidence. The dignity of a contralateral tumor should be assured by frozen section and in case of benign histology organ preserving therapy is indicated. Even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered, if the strict conditions for resection and follow-up are respected.
