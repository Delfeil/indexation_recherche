Objectives Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in children without creating permanent damage to the tibial or femoral physes. The semitendinosus tendon, left attached distally, is passed through a tunnel in the tibial epiphysis, led through the joint, passed behind the lateral femoral condyle and fixed to the outer aspect of the femur with a staple.
