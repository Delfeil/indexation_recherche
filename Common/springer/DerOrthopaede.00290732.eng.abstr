Despite improvements in component design, instruments, and operative technique, there remains a significant complication and failure rate in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Revision TKA accounts for every tenth operation in TKA. From June 1991 to June 1994, 209 TKAs (182 patients) were performed. Of these, 73 % were uncemented, 11.2 % cemented, and 15.8 % hybrid. The patella was resurfaced in 96 % with a cemented polyethylene or an uncemented metal-backed patella component.
