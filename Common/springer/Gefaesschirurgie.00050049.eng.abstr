 In median avcuate ligament syndrome, compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. A lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment. Depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways, the symptoms vary considerably. We report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two-vessel involvement. In such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit. Usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient. Bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow.
