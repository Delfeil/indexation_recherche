Seventy-six physicians, working on a German Mobil Resuscitation Unit, were examined by use of a modified Gottschalk-Gleser technique. The aim was to describe scores for anxiety, hostility and hope and to compare those to the values of a normal population. Physicians' sumscores differed from those of a normal population: Anxiety and hostility were significantly higher. Singlescores for death-, separation- and shame-anxiety were higher, those for injury-anxiety and diffuse anxiety were lower. Guilt anxiety did not differ. Scores for hostility outward open were the same, whereas hostility outward covered and inward were higher than in the normal population. Ambivalent hostility was the same. Scores for positive hope were significantly lower, those for negative hope the same than in the normal population.
