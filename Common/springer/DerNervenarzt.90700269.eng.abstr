Absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare developmental disorder of the human brain. Previous reports focused on the association with other cerebral anomalies. We present MRI scans showing an isolated absence of the septum pellucidum. The patient was suffering from a schizophrenic psychosis. Mental retardation or epileptic seizures, which are often found in more complex developmental brain disorders, were not observed. The septal area is part of the limbic system and aplasia of the septum pellucidum could indicate developmental anomalies of the limbic system. The concept of cerebral maldevelopment and the limbic system in schizophrenic psychosis is discussed.
