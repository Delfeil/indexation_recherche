 Purpose: Discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes. There is no information about the frequency of nerve lesions after revascularization of the lower limb. Methods: Between 1992 and 1996, 436 patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization, including 147 cases of deep revascularization, 127 supra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses, 116 infra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses and 56 femoro-crural bypasses. Mean patient age was 70.5 +/- 5.8 years; 182 patients were female and 254 were male. There was a 38% rate (166/436) of reoperation. All patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation, including the methods of Weber and Moberg. Results: We found eleven patients (4%) with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation. After the reoperation 55 patients (33%) had nerve lesions. Conclusions: Peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15% of our patients on discharge from hospital. They had mainly dysesthesia and hypesthesia but no kind of motor dysfunction. In our opinion, detailed preoperative information is very important because of the risk of sensitive nerve lesions.
