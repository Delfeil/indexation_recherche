 The use of somato-sensory evoked potentials (SEP) in supraaortal reconstructions has been well accepted. However, reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic SEP alterations differ widely. In a prospective study we registered SEP alterations during 482 operations done on 419 patients between 1 July 1994, and 31 December 1996. Incidence, risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated. In only 1.7% of cases SEP examination was inadequate. During 406 operations SEP were altered minimally or not at all. Significant changes were dedected during 65 interventions (13.5%). The clinical outcome was poor when alteration was found during carotid dissection (five events, three deficits). Cross-clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations (81.5%); they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance. As risk factor for cross-clamping ischaemia, only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified.
