Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) has been recently isolated from CD 4-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes of a healthy person. The present study was performed to find the antibody prevalence of this virus in the healthy Mexican population. Two hundred blood samples from candidates for blood donation at the General Hospital of Mexico were studied with the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFA) in HHV-7 infected SupT 1 cells. 83.5 % were male persons and 16.5 % female, the mean age for the male group was 28.8 years and for the female group 31.5. The donors came from 12 different states in Mexico, predominantly from the city (60.8 %), and had different occupations. Almost all samples (98.5 %) were positive to HHV-7. Other studies done revealed 1 % positive to brucella, 1 % positive to Hepatitis B, 2 % positive to syphilis, hepatitis C and HIV test were negative in the whole group studied. There was a high incidence of HHV-7 in the group studied: more then 50 % of the subject had high titers. This results should be further studied determine titers indicative of an active infection and to search for any association with illnesses.
