 Aim of the study: The technique of eversion endarterectomy (EEA) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is routinely used to treat severe, symptomatic or asymptomatic ICA stenosis at the vessel origin. ICA stenosis surgery is performed both to improve cerebral circulation and to eliminate a possible source of embolism. Discrepant examination findings are indicative of a so-called pseudo-occlusion of the ICA. The aim of this study was to give an updated survey of the literature on ICA pseudo-occlusion and to present our own cases with reference to the necessary diagnostic measures, the surgical procedure and the morbidity/mortality. Material and method: From June 1995 to June 1996, 112 patients were surgically treated for severe carotid stenoses or occlusions (pseudo-occlusions) by a total of three vascular surgeons. In the preoperative evaluation, we observed four patients, i. e. three men and one women aged 44 to 67 years, with discrepant cerebral perfusion findings. The mean age of all patients with carotid revascularization was 58.5 years. Results and conclusions: All patients with the finding of a carotid pseudo-occlusion were submitted to exploratory exposure and, in the case of retrograde flow, were revascularized by eversion EEA. All clinical courses were uneventful, and good regression of the neurological symptoms was observed in two patients in stage III (minor stroke) and IV (complexed stroke). Appling strict indication criteria, eversion EEA for pseudo-occlusion of the ICA is an excellent treatment modality with low morbidity that serves to prevent further cerebrovascular ischemic states.
