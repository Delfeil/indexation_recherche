This article reviews the history of psychotherapy research from the personal view of the author. The review first looks into the basic questions related to the effects of psychotherapy and the differentiation of general and specific factors. With the development of techniques for the study of the psychotherapeutic process, research has made considerable progress. The Vanderbilt projects, initiated by the author, belong to this context and focussed primarily on the contribution of the therapist to the treatment process. In his outlook, the author formulates some research goals that might be important in a time of economic pressure.
