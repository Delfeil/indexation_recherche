The peptide hormone relaxin has long been associated with changes in the uterus and cervix related to the suppression of spontaneous contractions and the softening and widening of the birth canal. However, most of these results were obtained in animals such as the pig or the rat which have a pronounced systemic relaxin physiology with a maximum serum level in the third trimester of pregnancy. In women and monkeys circulating relaxin levels barely ever exceed a few percent of those in other species and have a maximum in early pregnancy. This early peak probably reflects a paracrine physiology in the ovary and uterus which is associated with ovulation and decidual changes in the endometrium preparatory to implantation. Relaxin also supports other local functions related to osmoregulation, heart rhythm and tonus, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, recent studies show that relaxin can remodel connective tissue in the skin and thus offers a potential therapy for scleroderma patients. Finally, recent gene cloning studies have revealed that there are other relaxin-related peptides which may also be involved in similar relaxin-like functions, for example in the male. Thus relaxin should be regarded less as a specific hormone of late pregnancy than as a broad-range growth factor specializing in tissue remodelling and reproduction.
