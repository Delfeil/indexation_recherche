The programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult, especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory loudness (MAL) needs to be determined. Excessively high stimulation should be avoided as this can have a traumatic effect. The aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold (ESRT) and the postoperatively determined MAL and hearing threshold for 27 patients, each having one of three implant types. The question of whether the ESRT provides a practical technique to simplify, improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated. For the monopolar stimulation mode used for the Med-El and Clarion implant systems, the average MAL and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average ESRT across all electrodes. For the "common ground" stimulation mode used for the Nucleus implant system, a parabolic transformation was used to relate MAL and ESRT to one another. These transformations between MAL values calculated from the ESRT and the actual MAL values, determined psychoacoustically, diverged considerably from one another. Therefore, it was not possible to determine the MAL from the ESRT with certainty. The ESRT does, however, provide a means to estimate an approximate upper boundary for the MAL, apart from its use to control implant function. The determination of the exact MAL will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques.
