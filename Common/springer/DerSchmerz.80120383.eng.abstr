The antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds. Until twenty years ago, aspirin, phenazone derivatives and acetaminophen had been used as standard remedies for intercurrent harmless pain conditions in connection with infections, trauma, small surgeries, but also for tension headache and other painful conditions. During the last decades, this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2-arylpropionic acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation. Some of them (e.g. ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) have been given over-the-counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses. Nevertheless, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions.
