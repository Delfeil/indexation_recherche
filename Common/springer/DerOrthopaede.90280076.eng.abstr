Current concepts in treating arthritis by gene transfer are described, including different vector systems and strategies of gene transfer into target cells. Promissing antiarthritic gene products are a variety of growth factors which facilitate increased matrix synthesis and mitogensis in articular chondrocytes. Furthermore, rheumatoid joint destruction can be treated genetically by the transfer of certain antiinflammatory cytokine genes, which provide locally high concentrations of the antiinflammatory gene product. First clinical trails using the IRAP gene (interleukin I receptor antagonist protein) to eliminate the inflammatory reaction caused by interleukin I in rheumatoid joints are on its way. In order to investigate potential improvement in cartilage regeneration retroviral TGF- gene transfer in rabbit articular chondrocytes has been carried out. The TGF- group showed an in vitro increase in collagen type II neosynthesis by 304 %, compared to normal chondrocytes.
