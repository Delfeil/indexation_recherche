Background. In patients with diabetes mellitus an elevated level of plasma prorenin (PP) may be associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Although retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is also characterized by retinal vasoproliferation, no study on PP in ROP appears to have been carried out. This study investigated PP prospectively in preterm infants with high risk of ROP.
