  This study was designed to provide information to which extend home-based nursing care services for the elderly take part in the care for older people with mental disorders. Also of interest was the involvement of clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system in the health care for the clients. A one day data collection in 29 nursing care services in two North Rhine-Westphalian regions could raise informations about 1,246 clients aged 60 years and over 1, 522 persons (41.8%) had a mental disorder, diagnosed by a nursing and/or medical professional. 68% of the mental disordered clients had dementia or a demential disorder, 6% a functional psychoses, and 31% a neurotic, psychogenic disorder or substance abuse (small number of clients with two and more diagnoses). 82% of clients with mental disorders had one or more additional somatic disease(s). These diseases were mostly the cause for the involvement of home-based nursing care service. Barely 8% of clients with mental disorders were placed from clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system into the nursing care services. Beside the home-based care, only 12% of mental disordered received clients outpatient psychiatric treatment. Systematic cooperation between the nursing care services and the system of (gero-) psychiatric treatemnt was a rare exception.
