 Introduction: Undifferentiated, embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver, the incidence of which is highest in children between 6 and 10 years of age (14.1 %). Among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia. Embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults. To our knowledge, only 18 cases have been published in the last 50 years. Methods and results: We now present the case of a 29-year-old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma. Conclusion: This case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver. The management of this case comprised primary tamponade, interventional embolisation of the feeding artery, and secondary resection under stable conditions.
