Objectives: It was the aim of this investigation to report our initial clinical experience on the use of remifentanil in critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Additionally, we hypothesized that even under intensive care conditions remifentanil might facilitate a temporally predictable and "programmed" tracheal extubation.
