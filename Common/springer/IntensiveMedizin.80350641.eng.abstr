 As a non-invasive parameter QT dispersion has been investigated in different cardiovascular diseases and clinical conditions to demonstrate the ability of the method to predict ventricular arrhythmias and its clinical outcome, sudden cardiac death. Although various studies have shown significant QT dispersion in different patient groups, the method is still under discussion. QT dispersion has been extensively evaluated in ischemic heart disease showing frequently significant higher dispersion values in the infarction group compared to patients without cardiac diseases. Greatest QT dispersion values were reported from patients with susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmias or ventricular fibrillation in whom QT dispersion exceeded the QT dispersion in post-infarction patients without ventricular arrhythmias. Additionally, in patients with inducible monomorphic ventricular tachycardia during electrophysiologic testing QT dispersion was significantly greater than in patients without inducibility. Patients with inherited long QT syndrome, dilative or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ventricular arrhythmias QT dispersion has been reported to be significantly higher compared to those who were normal controls or had no arrhythmic event. However the values showed high variations and the results were not always confirmed by others. The clinical significance of QT dispersion has also been investigated with antiarrhythmic drug treatment as a potential marker for prediction of unwanted proarrhythmic complications. A close relationship between the administration of class I A and I C antiarrhythmic drugs and increased QT dispersion has been shown especially when myocardial ischemia (e. g. propafenone) was present. Conversely, class III antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone/sotalol) had no negative effect on or even reduced QT dispersion.
