Candida species have emerged as important pathogens in human infection. Although a variety of deep-seated candidal infections have been reported, Candida spondylitis has rarely been described. One patient with candida tropicalis spondylitis L I and L II in combination with candida coxitis is presented, and the 31 adult cases with vertebral involvement previously reported are reviewed. Candida spondylitis is noted as a simultaneous occurrence or late manifestation of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. Spondylitis may not be prevented by a course of Amphotericin B adequate to control the acute episode of disseminated candidiasis, particularly in immune suppressed patients. Spondylitis does not present as a postoperative wound infection. The insidious progression of infection, the nonspecificity of laboratory data, and the failure to recognise Candida as a potential pathogen may lead to diagnostic delay. Diagnosis can be made by either open biopsy or CT controlled needle aspiration. Successful therapeutic regimes have employed combinations of antifungal therapy (Amphotericin B or fluconazole) with radical surgical debridement. Ventral and facultatively dorsal instumentation is required to stabilize the spine. It is anticipated that the spondylitis will become a more commonly recognised manifestation of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. A increasing significance of candida species as etiologic agents of infection immune compromised humans has been recognised in the recent years. In those patients whom an antecedent Candida septicaemia was documented, a striking delay of 3.3 months was found between the septicaemia and the onset of symptoms as well as the time of diagnosis.
