 In 1-6 % of the patients who are investigated by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography a pancreas divisum can be found. In some patients pancreas divisum can lead to an acute relapsing and finally chronic pancreatitis (CP). Surgical intervention in these cases seems to offer a good chance of recovery. We report our experience with the duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas in 12 patients with pancreas divisum and CP. In all patients the preoperative evaluation showed clinical, functional or radiological signs of CP. The duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas was carried out in all patients without perioperative mortality. Ten postoperative versus eight preoperative patients showed a pathological exocrine function of the pancreas. Endocrine function, measured by the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), improved postoperatively in two patients. Eleven patients who were investigated after a mean follow-up time of 31 months (3-75 months) were completely pain free. No late mortality occurred. OGTT revealed a diabetic endocrine function in two patients. Disturbed exocrine pancreatic function had to be substituted in nine patients. One patient had to be reoperated by duct incision and renewal of the pancreatico-jejunostomy 10 months after the first operation. In conclusion, the duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas reduced pain in all patients with pancreas divisum and CP and may lead to an improvement of endocrine pancreatic function. Other, nonresecting procedures or endoscopic interventional therapy should be avoided in these patients.
