The present analysis comprises 3 studies on the interrater reliability of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS; German version). To our knowledge this is the first empirical report on interrater reliability and on results of rater training of the German version of the PANSS despite the widespread use of the scale. In a total of 47 training participants with different clinical experience standardized PANSS rater training was carried out and subsequently evaluated. Therefore, concordance rates with an expert standard (C) and weighted coefficients kappa (w) were calculated.
