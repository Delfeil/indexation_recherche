Choreoathetosis is a rare complication after surgery on congenital heart malformations with cardiopulmonary bypass and profound hypothermia. We reviewed the hospital course and follow-up of 3 patients, who developed acute chorea during the early postoperative period (within 3-6 days after surgery). CTscan of the brain and/or MRI were completely normal in all patients. Medical treatment with tiapride was administered in patient 1 and 2. In patient 2 symptoms resolved within several weeks; patient 1 and 3 showed residual choreiform movements for 48 and 14 months, respectively.
