 In patients with chronic pancreatitis the inflammatory process in the pancreatic head is frequently the pacemaker of the disease. In these cases an inflammatory tumor develops which leads to local complications in half of the patients. Duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection, contrary to procedures used in the past, offers the possibility to preserve stomach, duodenum, biliary tree, and the insulin secretory capacity. Duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is a subtotal resection of the pancreatic head. In a series of 380 patients the hospital mortality rate was 0.8 %, the frequency of reoperation 5.3 %, and the median hospitalisation time 13.9 days. The early postoperative glucose metabolism was deteriorated in 2 % and improved in 9 % of cases. After a median follow-up time of 6 years, 88 % of the patients were completely painfree or suffered pain rarely. Sixty-three percent were gainfully employed; the late mortality was 8.9 %. Only 10 % of the patients had further bouts of pancreatitis. The decisive advantage of duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection over Kausch-Whipple resection is preservation of the endocrine pancreatic function and of neighbouring organs.
