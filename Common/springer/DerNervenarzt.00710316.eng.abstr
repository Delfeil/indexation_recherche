We report on a 30-year-old patient with isolated, left-sided hypoglossal nerve palsy after uncomplicated, presumably streptococci-induced tonsillitis. Needle electromyography (EMG) of the tongue showed denervation changes in the muscles supplied by the left hypoglossal nerve. Cranial CT and MRI, CSF examination, Doppler sonography, visual evoked potential (VEP), and auditory evoked potential (AEP) showed no abnormalities and, in particular, no signs of the carotid artery dissection or brainstem lesion. The symptoms and signs resolved within a few weeks after penicillin V treatment. We suppose that the hypoglossal affection of the uncomplicated tonsillitis in this case was due to an aberrant position of the nerve.
