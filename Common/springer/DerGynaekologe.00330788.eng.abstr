Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is one of the most effective, invasive means of treating infertility. Since couples undergoing ICSI have a higher genetic risk than the general population, these genetic factors have to be taken into account (e.g., structural and numeric chromosomal aberrations or cystic fibrosis mutations). Only a small number of studies have satisfactorily evaluated the risk of de novo chromosomal aberrations in the offspring of such couples following an ICSI treatment.
