Introduction: Mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by CT and MRI. The applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air- and bone-containing thorax, which permits only restricted echo windows. Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography circumvents this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum.
