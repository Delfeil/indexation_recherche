  Suspected aortic dissection requires undelayed diagnosis by use of imaging modalities such as transesophageal ultrasound, contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This case report describes an asymptomatic man with echocardiographic suspicion of aortic arch dissection. The disordance with the clinical presentation led to CT, MRI, and eventually to contrast angiography, eventually confirming extensive haustration of the thoracic aorta and excluding any acute or chronic dissection.
