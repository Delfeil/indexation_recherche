 The measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients, their family, and personnel. A lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine, which in turn makes an impression on public opinion, and disturbs the reputation of the co-workers in intensive care medicine.   To form an objective view, we carried out a survey of 40 co-workers (11 physicians, 23 from the nursing staff, and 6 ancillary personnel) regarding the medical technology, the environment in the unit, general medical questions, and the extent of intensive care therapy. The length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1-240 months (median 18 months), the ages ranged from 21 to 53 years (median 30 years). Of those questioned 73%  found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful: 100% of the physicians and only 57% of the nursing staff were of this opinion. Only 9% of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear-inducing for the patients; in contrast, 61% of the nursing staff believed this to be true. The noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65% of the nursing staff and 45% of the physicians. Only 22% of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit; 48% felt that they were unhappy or even miserable. Of the physicians 46% believed that the patients were comfortable. Of the nursing staff 100% were of the opinion that for the deceased patients, organ substitution therapy had continued too long. On the other hand, only 45% of the residents shared this opinion.   The medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful, less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff. In many cases, the nursing staff as a group exhibited a contrary and negative opinion. This could possibly be caused by insecurity, lack of information and lack of successful experiences. Next to patient outcome, the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team, with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine.
