 Neurocognitive disorders are often the reason to call for an emergency physician. We report on a 71 year old male patient who showed a sudden sensorial clouding caused by an uremic encephalopathy. The patient was admitted to the intensive car unit. During the following two days he underwent three emergency hemodialysis sessions until renal function recovered. Further investigations revealed as hydronephrosis secondary to a benign prostatic hypertrophy as the cause of acute renal failure.
