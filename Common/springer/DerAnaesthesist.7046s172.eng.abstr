Background: Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA-IV) has markedly improved postoperative pain-relief. Alternatively, peridural anesthesia has been used successfully in high risk patients with the disadvantage of a more intense postoperative care. In this study we compared the applicability of intravenous vs. peridural patient-controlled analgesia on a general ward.
