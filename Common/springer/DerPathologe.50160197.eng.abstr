An immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibodies against Ki-67 (MIB 1), PCNA (PC 10), p 53 and Lewis X antigen was performed on 47 squamous carcinomas of the larynx after partial laser resection. Ki-67 index and expression of Lewis X antigen correlated significantly with both tumor recurrence rate and tumor-free interval. A much weaker relationship was found for the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and no correlation existed with p 53 expression. In conclusion, examination of Ki-67 and Lewis X antigen is thought to provide useful prognostic information concerning laser-resectable squamous carcinomas of the larynx.
