Background. During general anaesthesia gas climate significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques. Gas climatisation, however, markedly also will be influenced by the temperature loss at, and corresponding water condensation within the hoses, factors which are related to the technical design and material of the patient hose system. The objective of this prospective study was to investigate 1. how anaesthetic gas climatisation during minimal flow anaesthesia is influenced by the technical design of different breathing hose systems in clinical practice. 2. to investigate, whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used, proven beforehand to optimally warming and humidifying the anaesthetic gases.
