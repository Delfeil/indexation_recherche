Despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children, a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification. The aim of our retrospective cross-sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection. The parents of 70 hearing-impaired children were interviewed. All children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities. At an average age of 19.5 months, parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment. On average it then took an additional 7.2 months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation (fitting of hearing aids). Significantly, total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments. In addition to hearing loss, parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation. Statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing-impaired close relatives as well as first-born children tended to be diagnosed later. To further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss, the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration.
