Background: Epidemiologic studies have provided clear evidence that the majority of people affected by severe visual impairment are adults above the age of 60 years. The goal of this psychological research was to analyze the emotional and behavioral consequences of age-related visual impairment in three steps: descriptive data concerned with subjective well-being, depression, everyday competence, and leisure as well as explanations of interindividual variability based on individual and environmental variables are presented (study I). Also, the impact of the time of onset (early versus late in life) is addressed (study II). Finally, the role of the living accomodation (institutional versus private household) was the main target of another study (study III).
