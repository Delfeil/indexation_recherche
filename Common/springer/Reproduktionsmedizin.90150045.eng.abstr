 The recent introduction of a 1.48-µm diode laser system has brought a new stimulus to the field of laser-assisted reproduction. This objective-delivered laser can be applied in a noncontact working mode with extreme precision using conventional microscope and culture systems. A major application is the fast and efficient opening of the zona pellucida. In the field of assisted hatching, the use of this laser has enhanced the pregnancy rates for certain patient groups. Further, laser-assisted opening of the zona pellucida facilitates the removal of polar bodies or blastomeres for preimplantation genetic diagnosis. The precise openings allow for the use of blunt-ended, flame-polished aspiration needles, which greatly reduces the risk of damage to the embryo or the biopsied cells. Further modes of application of the diode laser system are the immobilisation of spermatozoa and the cryopreservation of spermazoa in empty, cell-free zona pellucida. This makes the laser technique and especially the diode laser system a versatile tool, which will be soon an essential part of assisted reproduction techniques.
