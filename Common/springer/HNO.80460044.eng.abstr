The precision of a new laser-guided navigation system (the "MKM") was compared with the "Viewing Wand" mechanical navigation system. We describe the inherent deviations in each positioning system as well as errors caused by data acquisition and referencing between the CT data set used for navigation and the original object. Two thousand individual measurements were performed on geometric test models scanned by CT. The technical accuracy of the mechanical navigation system varied between 0.48 mm in the most favorable area of the working field and 1.8 mm in the more inaccurate areas. For the laser-guided system a precision of 0.27 mm was found for all areas of the working field. After referencing between the CT data set and the original object, the error of measurement increased in both navigation systems: i.e., 0.83 mm for the Viewing Wand and 0.49 mm for the MKM system.
