A case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented. The tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII associated antigen) and express also histiocytic antigens (CD 68, lysozyme, Cathepsin D, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin) as well as CD 8. This marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with  histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of littoral cells angioma.
