 The treatment of persistent postoperative lymphatic fistulas or lymphoceles is often a problem. Approximately 2% of patients will develop lymphatic fistula after vascular surgery. This can require a long lasting conservative therapy. If spontaneous cure fails, a second operation with wound revision becomes necessary. We studied low-dose percutaneous radiotherapy to be used as an alternative treatment in addition to conservative or surgical therapy.  Between 1989 and 1998 29 patients (25 with lymphatic fistulas, 4 with lymphoceles) received radiation therapy. Depending on the depth of the fistula 27 patients were treated with electrons (7 to 18 MeV). Two other patients suffering of retroperitoneal lymphoceles received a treatment with photons (15 MV). In all patients the fractionation was 4- to 5 x 1.0 Gy/week and the dose ranged from 3 to 12 Gy depending upon the onset of the radiation therapy effect.  In 27 of 28 evaluable patients a complete disappearance of the fistula or lymphocele was achieved by radiation during therapy or shortly afterwards. In 1 case no benefit was observed after a dose of 11 Gy. This patient required further surgery with wound exploration.   Low dose percutaneous radiotherapy (up to 10 to 12 Gy) is effective to heal lymphatic fistulas and lymphoceles without complications. Individual dosage is required because doses even lower than 10 Gy may be effective. Radiation can be effective even after a failed conservative therapy or instead of surgery.
