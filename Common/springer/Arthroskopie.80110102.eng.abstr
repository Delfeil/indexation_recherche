Block of the sciatic and femoral nerves can be performed either by the surgeon or by the anaesthetist, allowing for numerous minimally invasive procedures in the knee and ankle joint. It also offers a certain flexibility with regard to the anaesthetist's schedule and provides a good and long anaesthesia and relaxation of the quadricep and hamstring muscles. Some contraindications - arrhythmia, severe conduction disturbance and heart failure - should be considered, as well as vegetative lability and oversensitivity to xylocaine, lidocaine or mepivacaine. There is no difficulty in finding the sciatic nerve and the femoral nerve as the topography is well described by Daniel C. Moore in his book about regional block. Though easy to perform, and even when wished for by the patient, the surgeon has to be aware of possible complications. In some cases we recommend that an anaesthesiologist stand by. In only 2 of 720 cases did the operation have to be interrupted because of severe pain or unexpected difficulty.
