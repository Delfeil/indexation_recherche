We performed a phase II trial with second-line chemotherapy in patients with refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder. Second-line therapy consists of 2.6 cycles of mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid. Two patients suffered from WHO grade III side effects (nephrotoxicity, leukocytopenia). We did not find any complete or partial remission. Four patients had a stable disease; 3.3 months after therapy, patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of 9 months. Four patients reported an improvement in quality of life. Since all patients received supportive care, improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone. In conclusion, second-line chemotherapy with mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid has no effect on refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder and is no alternative for cisplatin and methotrexate-based chemotherapy.
