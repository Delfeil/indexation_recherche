 Introduction: Since the landmark report by Crohn, Ginzburg and Oppenheimer in 1932, the spectrum of involvement of Crohn's disease has expanded to include the entire digestive tract from mouth to anus. The involvement of the esophagus by Crohn's disease is very rare. Methods: We report a 41-year-old male patient with severe Crohn's disease of the distal esophagus with a fistula to the right bronchial system. Results: After a long period of nutritional support we performed a transthoracic esophagectomy and a Nissen fundoplication. Postoperatively his course was complicated by pneumonia and withdrawal symptoms. Conclusions: Esophagectomy is indicated in Crohn's disease of the esophagus with severe stricture or fistula formations.
