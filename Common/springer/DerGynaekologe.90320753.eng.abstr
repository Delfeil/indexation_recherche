Pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia account for nearly 25 % of perinatal morbidity and mortality and are a leading cause of maternal death in developed countries. Consequently, early detection of women with a higher risk is helpful for intensified prenatal care. Since therapeutic options exist in some cases, screening for risk factors is required. Risk factors include parity, medical history, and family history. Laboratory tests of haemostasis and the detection of autoimmune disease complete adequate screening. More than 100 methods have been tested for the prediction of preeclampsia in the second trimester. Results obtained by Doppler ultrasound appear to be more reliable than most clinical parameters. However, no test presently available can really serve as a useful early marker of developing preeclampsia. More specific methods detecting endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation are being developed and might provide improved prediction.
