Many small randomized studies with <beta>-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure have been published in recent years. A large meta-analysis by Lechat combining 18 studies with 3023 patients showed a 32% reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers. Mortality and hospitalization together were reduced by 37%. In 1998 two large randomized trials investigating Bisoprolol (CIBIS II) and Metoprolol (MERIT-HF) were finished. Both studies show a significant reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers. The ongoing COMET study compares <beta>1-selective blockers like metoprolol with vasodilatative <beta>-blockers like carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure. Large clinical registries demonstrate clinical practicability of <beta>-blocker treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. All patients with stabel chronic heart failure ought to be treated with <beta>-blockers additional to a basic therapy with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis. The <beta>-blocker therapy regimen is to start with low doses and to increase the dose carefully:"Start low and go slow".
