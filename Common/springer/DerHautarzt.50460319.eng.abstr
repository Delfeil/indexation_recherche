 Wound healing represents a dynamic process of increasing scientific interest, especially with the detection of the different growth factors. Economic aspects are also of importance in the investigation of substances used for wound healing. In Germany 25% of all patients (ca. 1 million) with severe chronic venous insufficiency have crural ulcers. The influence of bacterial infection of crural ulcers is controversial. There is no doubt that the quantity of bacteria is of importance. Local antibiotic treatment is difficult, as most of the substances used are known to inhibit wound healing. In vivo and in vitro investigations showed, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic has a bacteriostatic function. Additionally it was shown, using cultures of fibroblasts, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic does not inhibit the growth of fibroblasts, whereas PVP-iodine solution, a widely used antiseptic, clearly reduces the growth of fibroblasts. The good clinical results in the treatment of acute and chronic radiation damage indicate that chiniofon-containing antiseptic may have antiflammatory activity.
