As compared with the broad discussion of ethical issues in medicine and health care, there seems to be little awareness of central problems such as obtaining Informed Consent of the patient or client in psychotherapy or psychological counselling, respectively. Difficulties in informing about chances and risks and of obtaining Informed Consent prove to be challenging in the treatment of children and youths, particularly in the context of relational problems in the family. Static and individualistic concepts resulting from an orientation at a medico-legal interpretation of "informed consent" as a desicional action only - as opposed to a dynamic process involving several participants - are not helpful here. The problem is analyzed on the basis of a case study of child abuse; considerations about problem solutions are discussed.
