Between 1.6.1995 and 31.12.1995, 17 trauma defect wounds were closed by suturing in 12 patients with a median of age of 35 (11 - 65) years, a new type of instrument for skin stretching being used in combination with a vacuum sealing procedure. According to clinical experience, closure of the skin defect would have required skin grafting in all patients. After secondary suturing 15 wounds healed without problems, while in the case of 1 wound there was a small skin defect, which healed spontaneously. In another sutured wound a partial dehiscence occurred over the medial malleolus on the 10th postoperative day; this also healed spontaneously without further surgical measures. There were no wound infections or necroses of the wound edges. This procedure is recommended for the closure of defect wounds, as it reduces the risk of wound infections, shortens the period of treatment and avoids cosmetically and functionally inadequate skin grafts.
