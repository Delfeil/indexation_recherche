In a special inpatient unit for detoxification treatment of illicit drugs, antagonist-induced opiate detoxification was studied in five nonselected inpatients with polytoxicomanic abuse. The purpose was to evaluate the feasibility of this detoxification method and its impact on further reaction to treatment. During rapid detoxification under general anesthesia in an intensive care unit, no complications occurred. Withdrawal symptoms were observed in all patients over several days. During the inpatient period, no patient could be motivated to take part in a longer rehabilitation therapy. Most patients were discharged prematurely on their own demand and none made use of the rehabilitation program offered to them. All patients relapsed after relatively short times and three out of five presented for a new detoxification treatment.
