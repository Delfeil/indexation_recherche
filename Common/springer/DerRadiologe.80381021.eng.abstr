Purpose: Electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) enables examinations with a very short acquisition time of 50 ms and thus permits cardiac imaging without motion artifacts. Utilizing eight detector rings simultaneous image acquisition in up to eight levels and complete imaging of the whole heart is possible. In studies, functional imaging with EBCT was compared to our angiocardiography, echocardiography, radionuclide, ventriculography and magnetic resonance tomography.
