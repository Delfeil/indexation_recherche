Among mandibular fractures, those of the condylar neck hold a special position due to the exceptional anatomical situation. Computer assisted tomography and magnetic resonance tomography have improved diagnostic evaluation. Indication for surgical treatment is given in cases of severely displaced or dislocated fractures. In surgical management, the preauricular, submandibular, retromandibular, and oral approach have been established. For sufficient fixation of fragments, procedures rendering a functional stability, like osteosynthesis with lag screw or by miniplating, are required.
