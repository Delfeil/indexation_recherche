Introduced in 1979, isotretinoin remains a major advance in acne therapy. Both hospital- and community-based dermatologists have experience with this valuable drug, which, owing to its causal principle of action, offers a large proportion of patients the prospect of a cure. Isotretinoin is now in use in more than 80 countries and has been prescribed for some six million patients. Based on accumulated clinical findings with the drug, more comprehensive recommendations can now be made with respect to indications, dosing and duration of treatment than was possible when the drug was launched. Experience with the drug also provides a basis for reevaluating its safety profile. Finally, at a time when healthcare resources are limited, it is important to examine the cost-benefit ratio of this acne treatment versus other options. This paper is accordingly intended to provide a critical status report as well as a detailed and balanced set of recommendations for clinical practice.
