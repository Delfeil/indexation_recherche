Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD), a rare extrapyramidal motor illness, is usually only confirmed after death. In vivo diagnosis has relied hitherto on the combination of typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (the "eye of the tiger" sign) and heterogeneous clinical symptoms of movement disorder which have been regarded as almost pathognomonic. We report on the diagnostic contribution of 123J--CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and 123J-IBZM SPECT in akinetic-rigid Parkinson's syndrome occurring in a case of HSD. In contrast to Parkinson's disease and multisystem atrophies, the results of both tests were normal. This constellation of findings shows that the degeneration lies primarily outside the nigrostriatal system, supporting arguments for the nosologic distinction of HSD from other extrapyramidal illnesses.
