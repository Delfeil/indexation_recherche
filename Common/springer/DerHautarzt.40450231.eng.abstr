Abstract.  Many different congenital and acquired skin diseases are seen along Blaschko's lines. In 1992, Moulin et al. [40] described five patients affected with a new clinical entity characterized by acquired atrophic band-like skin lesions showing hyperpigmentation. We report on a further patient with this skin disease. Characteristic features are hyperpigmented atrophoderma arranged in a pattern following the lines of Blaschko, with no preceding inflammation and no subsequent induration or scleroderma. The lesions usually appear during childhood or adolescence, but sometimes in young adults. For this skin disease we propose the term `linear atrophoderma of Moulin'.
