The news of success in ether anesthesia on 16 October 1846 in Boston spread like wildfire through Europe. In the German-speaking countries, the national newspapers as conveyers of the development played a prominent role; this was especially the case for the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung whose correspondent, Aloys Martin [1], was a medical professional. The function of local newspapers has not yet been investigated. This was to be remedied by examining both of Bamberg's local papers. All issues from 01.01. to 31.04.1847 were surveyed with respect to relevant announcements. These were then catalogued according to date, extent and contents. Starting on 22.01.1847, the events outside of and in Bamberg were reported on in 26 notices and articles of just a few lines to half a page and in advertisements; Aloys Martin also appears on the scene. Thus, the local press in Bamberg also informed its readers early and regularly on the discovery of ether and the succeeding events.
