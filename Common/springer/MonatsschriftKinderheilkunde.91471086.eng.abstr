The ECG of a 15-year-old boy hospitalized for rhythm disturbances showed a sustained ventricular tachycardia (beat rate 170 to 180/ min) with left axis deviation and complete right bundle branch block. His echocardiogram showed a structurally normal heart with diminished left ventricular performance. Intravenous application of verapamil led to prompt termination of the tachycardia, after previous attempts with various other antiarrhythmic agents had failed. Sinus rhythm remained stable. ECG and echocardiographic changes returned to normal. Course and findings are characteristic of  verapamil-sensitive idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia, an entity which so far has only rarely been observed in children.
