In this retrospective study, oncologic and functional results of 24 patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages C and D are reported. The surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid-transcervical approach, which was modified according to individual tumor growth. As needed, this was combined with a transtemporal or retrosigmoid approach. Complete tumor removal resulted in a cure rate of 100%. Surgically induced cranial nerve palsies developed in 38% of the patients. In 54% of cases it was possible to retain middle ear function. Seven patients had incomplete tumor removal requiring postoperative irradiation, with tumor progression occurring in 2 patients. Radical tumor removal was modified by efforts to reduce mutilating resections. These results show that individually tailored and combined multidirectional surgical approaches can allow total tumor removal to be performed with lower morbidity.
