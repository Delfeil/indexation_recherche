DNA cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis. The detection of a DNA-aneuploid stemline supports the diagnosis of a high-grade malignant bone neoplasm, even in small biopsies. Solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have DNA-diploid cell populations. Low-grade central osteosarcomas may show single-cell aneuploidies of varying extent as well as a DNA-diploid stemline. Their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a DNA-aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation.
