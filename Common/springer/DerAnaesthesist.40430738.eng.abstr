 Different anaesthetic procedures that were used during an in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) program have been analysed in order to determine their influence on plasma levels of estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and -endorphin and results of IVF-ET. Methods. Fifty-four patients awaiting transvaginal oocyte aspiration were randomised into three groups: (1) anaesthesia with ketamine as an induction agent and analgesic (n=20); (2) general intubation anaesthesia using thiopentone for induction and enflurane for maintenance (n=18); and (3) no anaesthesia (n=16). Estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and -endorphin were measured from day 3 to 14 referring to follicle aspiration. Differences between preoperative hormone levels and their intra- and postoperative peaks were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test (P<0.03). The results were corrected using the Holms method (=0.05). Results. No differences were observed in estradiol and progesterone levels (Figs. 1, 2). Prolactin levels were 1.4 times higher (P<0.001) when ketamine was used and 2.2 times higher (P<0.001) after short general anaesthesia than in the control group (Fig. 3). Similar results were observed with respect to -endorphin: in comparison with the control group we found significant elevation by a factor of 2.1 when ketamine was used (P<0.001). The discrepancy became even more marked with general anaesthesia: -endorphin was 3.9 times higher compared to the controls (P<0.001) (Fig. 4). Comparing the two groups who were given anaesthetics, prolactin and -endorphin levels were also significantly different (P<0.001). The IVF procedure itself did not appear to be affected by different anaesthetic procedures during oocyte aspiration (Table 2). Conclusions. The increased prolactin and -endorphin plasma levels associated with ketamine and general anaesthesia reflect a significant alteration of the observed hormone levels. When anaesthesia is indicated, we try to avoid general intubation anaesthesia in favor of ketamine.
