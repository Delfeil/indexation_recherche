The influence of aspirin treatment on haemostasis is still under debate. There are doubts in emergency operations, especially in transplant patients, concerning dosage and change in medication. Our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in German transplantation centres. The question of transplant suitability, dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature. Some 92.11 % of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin. In these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in 34.2 % of the centres. An increased mortality has not been reported. Most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of 100 mg aspirin daily. Only 7.89 % of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin-treated patients. Correctly indicated aspirin treatment (for cardiac arrhythmia, embolism, or thrombosis, for example) does not contraindicate renal transplantation (daily dosage up to 100 mg). In elective surgery, however, a preoperative change in medication is recommended, e. g., the heparin instead of aspirin.
