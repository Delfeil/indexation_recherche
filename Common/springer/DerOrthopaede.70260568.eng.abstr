A retrospective study was conducted to compare the results of posterior with combined anterior/posterior lumbar fusion in adults. Seventy-six consecutive posterior cases fused with pedicle screws and 46 combined cases were included and followed for at least 2 years. Subjective assessment was based on the Visual Analogue Scales, Waddel Disability and Impairment Score and the GBB for objective quantification of complaints. Furthermore, a thorough clinical examination was done and X-rays including flexion/extension radiographs, were taken. Questions were asked about the occupational status as well. Pain decreased significantly more in the combined cases than in the posterior fusion cases. In one case a lesion of the common iliac vein occurred during a retroperitoneal approach. Only about half the patients working preoperatively returned to work again. In conclusion, the benefit of better pain relief after combined fusion must be regarded in relation to a higher complication rate due to a second approach.
