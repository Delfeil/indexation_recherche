Intramuscular injections of botulinum neurotoxin type A cause  reversible chemodenervation and subsequent paralysis by blocking the presynaptic release of acetylcholine. Botulinum toxin type A has emerged as the most effective form of symptomatic treatment for abnormabilities in muscle movement (blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, torticollis) and has been approved for use in these conditions. First results in the treatment of patients suffering from oromandibular dystonia, myogenic craniomandibular dysfunction and recurrent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint are presented. In most cases, therapeutic effects occurred within 1-6 days post-injection. Muscular hyperfunction was reliably reduced and involuntary activity patterns gradually ceased. No severe side effects of the local injections were noted.
