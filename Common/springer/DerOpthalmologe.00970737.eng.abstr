Background. The long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide is used as a therapeutic option for patients with diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Growth factors, such as EGF, bFGF, VEGF, and PDGF, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of octreotide on the growth-factor-induced proliferation of bovine retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in vitro.
