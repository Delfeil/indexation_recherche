Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of carotid artery stenosis represents an innovative experimental modality which has been increasingly employed in high-risk patients. Currently, results from prospective randomized trials are not available; thus, guidelines with regard to indications and technique are preliminary. Numerous technical innovations to avoid associated complications have evolved in neurointerventional procedures. Dedicated guiding catheters and stents using a transfemoral approach have been introduced for treatment of carotid artery disease. Low-profile stent delivery systems may decrease risk of releasing embolic load when crossing high-grade stenosis or kinking of the vessel. The introduction of a cerebral protection with the use of temporary occlusion balloons or filter systems has resulted in a reduction of procedure-related neurological complications, and is strongly recommended by leading experts in the field.
