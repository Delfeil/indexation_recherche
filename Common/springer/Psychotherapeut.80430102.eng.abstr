Myths about development during midlife are examined in the light of recent research studies. These studies show clearly, that midlife is a developmental phase of its own, the course of which can only slightly be predicted by previous development. The assumption of a depressive crisis automatically occuring must be rejected as well as "positive myths" denying the evolving limitations in certain areas of life. Developmental tasks and developmental possibilities are described as well as the clinical concept of a phase-specific "return of the repressed". Possibilities of councelling and psychotherapy with couples during midlife are outlined.
