 Background: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is one of the most common forms of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population.   Patients and methods: 41 children with a mean age of 9.6 (3.7-16) years with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) refractory to medical treatment (n=38) and recurrent syncope (n=3) underwent electrophysiologic (EP) study. In all patients dual AV-nodal physiology could be demonstrated during EP study and typical form of AVNRT (mean heart rate 220/min) could be induced by programmed atrial stimulation. A steerable 7 F ablation catheter was placed at the inferoparaseptal region of the tricupid valve annulus close to the orifice of the coronary sinus with the intention to record a late fractionated local atrial electrogram during sinus rhythm. Starting at this point radiofrequency current (500 kHz) with a target temperature of 70 °C was delivered with the intention to ablate the slow pathway. If a slowly accelerated junctional rhythm (<120/min) occurred during energy discharge, programmed atrial stimulation was repeated. Otherwise radiofrequency current was delivered step by step up to a septal position next to the tricuspid valve annulus. Slow pathway ablation was defined as lack of evidence of dual AV nodal pathways during repeated atrial stimulation. Slow pathway modulation was defined as maximal one atrial echoimpulse after ablation.   Results: The number of energy applications ranged from 1-19 (median 6). In 35/41 patients slow pathway ablation could be achieved; in six patients the slow pathway was modulated. In none of the patients permanent high grade AV block was observed. During follow-up (mean 4.1 years) two patients had a recurrent episode of AVNRT after slow pathway modulation. All other patients are still free of AVNRT without medical treatment.   Conclusion: Selective radiofrequency current ablation/modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of AVNRT in young patients.
