Tuberculosis is, on a global level, still one of the most important infectious diseases. Effective control of tuberculosis could probably be achieved by a combination of chemotherapy and vaccination. Although a vaccine (BCG) is available, it cannot prevent the development of tuberculosis of the lungs in adults as the most frequent disease manif- estation. The development of a new vaccine against tuberculosis therefore remains a primary goal. Because the immune defense against M. tuberculosis depends on different T-cell subpopulations, the optimal combination has to be stimulated to achieve protection. Because one third of the world population is already infected with M. tubercolosis, possibly two vaccines are needed: one therapeutic vaccine to fight an already estab- lished infection and a preventive vaccine. Currently different vaccine candidates are under development. It is still to early to predict, which may be successful.
