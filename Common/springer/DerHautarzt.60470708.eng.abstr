We report two patients with bullous phototoxic contact dermatitis caused by Dictamnus albus L. (gas plant) which belongs to the Rutaceae family. In both cases long lasting postinflammatory hyperpigmentations were observed as a result of the phototoxic contact dermatitis. The phototoxic components of Dictamnus albus L. are the furocoumarins 5-methoxypsoralen (bergapten) and 8-methoxypsoralen, and the alkaloid dictamnin whose phototoxic properties were recently discovered. Even though reactions to the gas plant have been infrequently reported, it is becoming more popular with gardenus and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of phototoxic contact dermatitis.
