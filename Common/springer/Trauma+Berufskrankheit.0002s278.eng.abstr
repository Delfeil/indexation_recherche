The law provides for early networking of the whole range of institutions concerned with rehabilitation. The regulations involved are not observed in practice, with consequent poor results for the insured persons, leading to unnecessary costs of 50,000 DM and more, which could be saved. The first deficiency in the rehabilitation process is the lack of any early rehabilitation in the acute hospital, and the second, the absence, lateness or inadequacy of rehabilitation after active treatment. The third is the failure to link the medical rehabilitation prescribed with the patient's regular work, which means that inability to work persists for months. These gaps in rehabilitation could be avoided in individual cases if the person in charge at the insurance company were to take advice from a doctor specialized in physical and rehabilitation medicine and to proceed in the light of this advice. In future A and E doctors on call should take initial and continuing training in rehabilitation medicine, so that medical rehabilitation can be monitored and influenced from a single base.
