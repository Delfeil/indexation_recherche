Metabolic emergencies are rare entities in intensive care medicine. In most cases, they develop from chronic endocrine disorders. Extremely rare metabolic emergencies, that develop from inborn errors of diverse enzyme sytems will not be discussed in this manuscript. The underlying diseases are in most cases known, they occur in children and adolescents and their treatment should be exclusively in the hands of highly specialized pediatrics. The most important metabolic emergencies are the diabetic hyperglycemic comas with or without ketoacidosis and/or hyperosmolarity and the hypoglycemias. The pathophysiology, the clinical signs and symptoms as well as the first line treatment of these disorders should be known by everybody who is in the field of emergency. In patients with unclear disturbed consciousness, coma or epilepsy, diabetic emergencies should be included. Other endocrine disorders like adrenal insufficiency, thyroid storm and myxoedematous coma also may cause disturbed consciousness or coma. These disturbancies also have to be known and should be considered in cases of unknown comas. The pathophysiology, clinical signs and symptoms as well as treatment will be discussed in the following article.
