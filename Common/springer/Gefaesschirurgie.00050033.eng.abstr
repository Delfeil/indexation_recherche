 Aim: To investigate the distribution of collagens in experimental microvascular surgery. Material and methods: Autografts (4 mm) of the left common carotid artery in 20 Wistar rats were harvested up to 4 weeks after surgery. The specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of collagen III and IV. Results: The demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture. In the intima, the organisation and amount of collagen IV was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments. The media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for regenerating the continuity break. The adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis, in which collagen III and IV-positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion. The marked myointimal hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was made up of collagen-positive extracellular matrix. Conclusions: Our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery. The identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery.
