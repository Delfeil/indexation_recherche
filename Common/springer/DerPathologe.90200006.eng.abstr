Empirical knowledge, daily diagnostic efforts and scientific spirits are the prerequisites of theoretical and practical progress in gynecopathology. The current standards in this field have their root in the continuous interests of gynecologists educated and skilled in pathology. In Germany, however, there is no more the gynecologist, who is in charge for both the clinical and pathological diagnostic business. Also, it is no more a rule for gynecologists to pass through a fellowship in pathology during their specialization. This development leads to more distance between gynecology and pathology, which per se is a potential source of misunderstandings. One of the tasks of this introduction and subsequent articles is to describe controversial areas and to offer ways out of the conflicts. Yet, the master key for avoiding misunderstandings is the close interdisciplinary cooperation in the perioperative management of the patient.
