 We present the case of a 52-years old patient, in whom an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) had to be implanted in 1996 for reason of recurrent ventricular tachycardia. The patient developed an infection of the system, which therefore needed to be explanted. The attempt to replace a transvenous system a few days later was not successful, because there was a complete thrombosis (clinical asymptomatic) of the central venous system, including the superior vena cava. We then placed the lead directly via the right atrium performing a small anterior right-sided thoracotomy through the 4th intercostal space. The device was placed subpectoral on the right side and functioned as well as a left sided device. This procedure seems us to be less harmful than the alternative of placing epicardial patches.
