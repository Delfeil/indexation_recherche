This case report refers to a German patient with sterile eosinophilic pustulosis of the Ofuji type (SEP), which is rarely described in non-Japanese humans. The distinctive histomorphology, with intraepidermal eosinophilic abscesses and eosinophilic folliculitis, is complemented in this patient by marked eosinophilia, evident eosinophilic bone marrow reaction and involvement of the oral mucosa with eosinophilic spongiosis, which is a feature that had not previously been reported. Possible transitions between cutaneous and internal hypereosinophilic syndromes are discussed. Despite the initial good effect of topical corticosteroids on the cutaneous changes, long-term follow-up to check for internal involvement is necessary.
