The Q-switched ruby laser (wave length 694 nm; pulse durations 25 ns or 40 ns) causes selective damage to natural and artificial skin pigments. Treatable lesions include benign pigmented growths (benign lentigo, ephelides, café-au-lait spots and Becker's nevi), as well as amateur and professional tattoos. The Q-switched ruby laser is also very effective in the treatment of traumatic tattoos. We report our experiences with two patients whose traumatic tattoos resolved completely without any scarring after ruby laser therapy. Our findings show that Q-switched ruby laser treatment may represent the therapy of choice for these tattoos.
