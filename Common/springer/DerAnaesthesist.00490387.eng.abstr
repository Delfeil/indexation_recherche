Background: The present study compared the quality of neuromuscular block and costs after equipotent doses of mivacurium and vecuronium in the context of paediatric ENT surgery. Methods: A total of 30 children undergoing elective tonsillectomy were included and randomised in two groups (n=15 for each) according to the neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) used. Anaesthesia was induced with alfentanil (15 µg/kg), propofol (3 mg/kg) and either 0.2 mg/kg mivacurium or 0.14 mg/kg vecuronium. For maintenance of anaesthesia propofol (8-12 mg/kg/h) was given. Neuromuscular block was assessed by electromyography using train-of four stimulation and the following parameters were quantified: Twitch height (T1) 2 min after the initial bolus of the myorelaxant; duration until recovery to 10% T1, number and duration of bolus injections of the myorelaxant needed to maintain neuromuscular block to a T1<10%. In addition, the intubating conditions, number of patients needing pharmacological reversal at the end of surgery, adverse reactions and the costs for neuromuscular block and pharmacological antagonization were assessed.
