Abstract  Clinical studies revealed that the size of the margin of resection and the microscopic findings at the edge of the specimen did not influence the rate of recurrence. Regarding early lesions of Crohn's disease, the aim of the present study was to identify morphological alterations which are able to explain the clinical findings and are in accordance with the operative procedure. In the present study the resection margins of 29 patients with Crohn's disease were investigated using the scanning electron microscope. Seventy-three percent of patients with histopathologically unaffected resection margins in the small bowel and 71 % in the large bowel showed early lesions. These consisted of mucosal architectural alterations, epithelial bridge formation and goblet cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Curative resection is not possible, independent of the resection margins. The morphological findings underline the correctness of the usual operative procedure, namely limited resections in Crohn's disease.
