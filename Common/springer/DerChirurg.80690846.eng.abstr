 Between September 1992 and May 1997 in the Department of Surgery at the Medical University of Lübeck 240 colorectal procedures were performed by laparoscopic techniques. Fifty-seven patients underwent laparoscopic colectomy for diverticulitis. In 52 cases sigmoid resections were performed laparoscopically, including 4 cases with simultaneous laparoscopic rectopexy. Anterior resections were necessary in 3 patients, whereas 2 patients with extended localization of diverticula required left hemicolectomies. Using atraumatic instruments and an ultrasound dissector, laparoscopic resection involved tubular dissection and preperitoneal anastomosis. The mean operative time was 234 min. In 8 cases (14 %) conversion to an open procedure was necessary. Complications occurred in 6 patients (10.5 %). One patient died because of an anastomotic leakage. In conclusion, with increasing experience laparoscopic resection for diverticulitis can be performed without additional morbidity in comparison to open colectomy. In particular, the benefits of the minimally invasive method are quicker reconvalescence with reduced postoperative pain and improved cosmesis.
