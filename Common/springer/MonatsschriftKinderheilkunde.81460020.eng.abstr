We report on a 15-year-old girl and her relatives with typical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII. Main symptoms of this disorder are fragile skin, easy bruisability, joint hypermobility, features suggesting premature aging, and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth. The inheritance of this type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant. The biochemical and genetic defects have not yet been elucidated.
