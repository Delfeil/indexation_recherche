The case of a 54-year-old male with a compression fracture of the T 12 vertebral body and a bilateral anterior column fracture of the acetabulum is presented. The origin of this rare combination of fractures is explained by the action of the patient's own muscle force on bone of very poor quality. The treatment of these lesions is comparable to the treatment of similar fractures in bone of normal quality.
