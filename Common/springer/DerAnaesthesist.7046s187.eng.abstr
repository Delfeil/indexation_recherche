Effects of anaesthesia and analgesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality remain controversial. Numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality. In patients undergoing vascular surgery, epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative hypercoagulability. These patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re-operation. However, regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies. One reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care. A multimodal therapeutic approach, which consists of preoperativ patient information, sufficient analgesia, early mobilisation and enteral feeding, may solve this discrepancy. Therefore, prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome.
