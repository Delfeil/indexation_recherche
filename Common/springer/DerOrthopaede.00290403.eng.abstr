The natural course of Osteonecrosis (ON) of the femoral head has yet not been evaluated sufficiently. Especially in the early forms of the disease (ARCO 0 to II) without collapse of the femoral head, useful information on the natural course could only be collected since the routine use of MR-imaging. The unspecific findings in ARCO stage I with negative radiographs are potential reversible. The "point of no return" already lies in the irreversible ARCO stage II in almost all cases. Prognosis for further progression for both early stages depends primarily on the extension and location of the lesion. Only the rare, small to medium sized lesions in the medial or central location may have a good prognostic course over a period of more than five years. The much more common large sized and lateral located lesions will have a probability of about 80 % to progress to femoral head collapse within two years.
