The combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three-dimensional bone architecture. Microcomputed tomography avoids the time-consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections. Furthermore, its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 mm. Thus, three-dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone.
