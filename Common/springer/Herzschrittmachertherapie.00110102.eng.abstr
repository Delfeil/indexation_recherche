 Background: High specifity and high positive prediction have been reached in risk stratification for SCD after AMI by combining multiple methods. However, sensitivity and positive prediction are still not satisfying. One of these methods is the measurement of HRV, established as an independent predictor for SCD. Actually, HRV is used in cardiology, diabetology and neonatology to obtain quick assessment of the present state of the autonomic nervous system.   Aim of the study: We studied the short-term measurement of HRV in patients after AMI as an additional method for risk stratification.   Method: We performed one measurement over 5 minutes at rest and one with parasympathetic stimulation by regularized breathing in 158 patients 11 +/- 5 days after AMI. The measurement was repeated immediately and after one week. 87 patients had an additional Holter ECG.   Results: Correlation of two consecutive measurements showed a Pearson's correlation coefficient between 0.87 and 0.95. Comparing short- and long-term measurement, only the parameters obtained at rest showed satisfying correlations, but not the parameters representing parasympathetic activity. There was no correlation between HRV and age and, for measurement with parasympathetic stimulation, between HRV and diabetes.   Conclusions: Short-term measurement of HRV has an excellent reproducibility and provides reliable information about the balance of the autonomic nervous system. After defining cut-off values and evaluating the method with patients at high risk for SCD, it seems to be a simple and quick method for risk stratification after AMI. Finally, it can also be used for evaluation of patients with diabetes.
