Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a primary heart muscle disease characterized by progressive myocardial atrophy of the right ventricle, with transmural fatty or fibrofatty replacement, either segmental or diffuse, accounting for electrical instability at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. It was recently included among cardiomyopathies in the revised WHO classification. The disease was found to be a major cause of sudden death in the young and in athletes of the Veneto Region, Italy. A familial occurrence with autosomic dominant inheritance was then discovered with a prevalence estimated to be 6/10,000 inhabitants and 5 loci have been identified by linkage analysis so far, 2 mapping to chromosome 14 and to chromosome 1, 2 and 3 one each. A recessive form associated with palmoplantar keratosis has also been reported, mapping to chromosome 17. Nonetheless, the specific gene defects as well as the defective coded proteins have not yet been identified.
