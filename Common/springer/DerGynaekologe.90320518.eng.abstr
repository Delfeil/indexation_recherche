Sepsis developing on the basis of a postoperative infection is a rare, but life-threatening event. Early diagnosis of postoperative complications usually facilitates decisive intervention and a favorable prognosis. If the right moment is missed, endothelial damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and generalized systemic infection (SIRS). For the subsequentially developing septic shock, often combined with multiple organ failure (MOF), it is not important whether the starting point was an uncontrollable infections focus, ischemic damage following hypovolemic shock, or massive bacterial translocation with postoperative bowel obstruction. The collapse of the immune system results in immune paralysis and explains the inability of the organism to defend itself against systemic infections. For early recognition of the developing septic complication and its effective treatment, pathophysiological and clinical issues are discussed.
