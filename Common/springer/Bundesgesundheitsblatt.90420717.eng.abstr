The methodology of transformation assays in in vitro carcinogenesis has been continuously improved to make them routinely applicable. In most of the recently employed transformation assays colony counting was performed under a stereo microscope. We have investigated the application of a computerized image analysing system to determine transformed colonies after in vitro cultivation of epithelial canine kidney cells. Special intention was imposed on the calibration of the system. First results show that determination of number and surface of transformed colonies in soft agar were rapidly available. In addition a high level of reproducibility and a thereby enhanced reliability could be achieved. The implementation of such a computerized image analysis in routine performance of transformation assays would enhance its robustness and applicability and minimize the bias due to evaluation under the stereo microscope to an important extent. It may also be used for similar purpos (e.g. cytogenetic tests).
