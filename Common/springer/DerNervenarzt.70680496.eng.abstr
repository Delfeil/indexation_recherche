Computer-aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical computation leads to simplification of this investigation, and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed. Simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized. In contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the ICP reaches a plateau. Our mathematical method diverges with the description of a pressure-dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models. For that we are able to take the non-linearity of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration. The intrathecal infusion test is a reliable diagnostic method for measuring resistance and compliance in patients suspected of having normal pressure hydrocephalus.
