The therapy for burn injuries has established a definable management: percentage of the body surface area burned and thickness are important for the method of treatment (ambulant, on ward, intensive burn center). Open and close wound care with different bandages, in combination with primary surgery, has increased the probability of survival. A special problem is the aesthetics and function of the head and neck area. Hypertrophy and keloid scars may be disturbing, especially in children who have had a scald accident (41.2% of cases were children up to 5 years of age). The possibilities of correction are multiple: conservative therapy (bandages, ointment treatment, physical therapy) or surgical intervention with free skin transplantation or difficult flaps (pedicle flap, free graft, expanded flap, and microvascular anastomosed flap). The aim of research is also to cover large defects with skin culture from small donor areas. It is necessary to establish maxillofacial and plastic surgery from the beginning of the treatment for aesthetic and functionally acceptable results.
