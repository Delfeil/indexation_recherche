Abstract.  Surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries, often involving the femoral vein. Because of the famous case presented by Roux in 1813, the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable, but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to ligate the femoral artery. Zaufal's principle (1880) consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes. This surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever. In the limb, the congestion induced in the vein had a positve effect on the healing process. The surgical treatment of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis was initially (1931) aimed at achieving decompression in compartment syndromas. The first thrombectomy was performed in 1937, but several operations with a successful outcome were reported at the 61st annual meeting of the German Society of Surgery in the following year.
