Pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion. Nevertheless, thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications. The most frequent complication is hemorrhage. Of these, the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare, but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications, and they have an extremely poor prognosis. Within 58 months 361 patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas. In 22 patients (6.1%) the hematoma developed as a complication of systemic thrombolysis. Two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery. One patient died: the other survived but was severely disabled. The latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned. These worrying examples stress the necessity for careful evaluation of risk factors and the natural history of the underlying disease for which systemic thrombolysis is indicated. Local selective (or superselective) thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure, provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications.
