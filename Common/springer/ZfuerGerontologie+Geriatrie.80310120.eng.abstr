  Effects of 94 different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well-being in the elderly were meta-analyzed. Psychological well-being was improved and self-rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation. The mean effect size for other-rated depression reached d=1.15. Whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self-rated well-being or depression, other-rated depression improved less in older samples. High effect sizes derived from control-enhancing interventions and behavior therapy. Sub-analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting. Higher "therapeutic" qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect-sizes too. Implications for planning inteventions in old age are discussed.
