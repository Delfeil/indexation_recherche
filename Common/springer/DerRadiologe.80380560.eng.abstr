Purpose: The high incidence of acute and chronic diseases of the venous system requires the application of reliable, non-invasive, low-cost methods in diagnosis and follow-up after therapy. Material and Methods: Current technology, principles of examination, and results of ultrasonography of the peripheral venous systems are reviewed. Results: Since the mid 1980s, compression ultrasonography (US) has been introduced in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Doppler-US methods reach the hallmarks of venous imaging, particularly since the advent of color duplex US. In thrombosis, post-thrombotic syndrom, and primary varicosis, color duplex US increasingly replaces the "gold standard" of phlebography as the imaging method of choice. Venous diseases of the neck, and of the upper and lower extremities are reliably recognized by color duplex US. New areas of application of Doppler- and duplex-US include examinations of the venous system in patients in intensive care units, evaluation of transplanted organs, and the demonstration of blood flow in hemodialysis shunts. Conclusions: Color duplex US is useful in most imaging investigations of the peripheral veins. In view of cost development in the medical imaging sector, however, in which ultrasonography takes a major part, critical indication for the application of Doppler- and duplex-US in the diagnosis and follow-up of venous disease is of outmost importance.
