 A total of seven cases of accidental ingestion of methadone or dihydrocodeine by four children and three adults are reported of which four were fatal. In each case, someone in the environment was taking methadone or dihydrocodeine as a substitute drug for heroin addiction who obviously did not realize the dangers of methadone for non-addicts. Possible preventive measures are the usage of child-proof containers with adequate labels for take-home medications. Furthermore substituted addicts have to be thoroughly indoctrinated concerning the toxicity and hazards of methadone.
