 This paper presents the authors' experience with congenital oesophageal stenosis (= CES) in three patients who had CES due to tracheobronchial remnants. Difficulties with feeding started at 6-9 months of age, which corresponded with the introduction of solids. Contrast studies showed stenosis at the junction of the mid and distal thirds of the oesophagus. Limited resection of the oesophageal stenosis and primary anastomosis was performed in all three patients with good results. CES should be suspected if all other causes of oesophageal stenosis have been excluded by upper gastrointestinal examinations, endoscopy, oesophageal pH monitoring and oesophageal manometry.
