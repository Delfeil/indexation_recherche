Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is evaluated mainly by orthoptic examination and morphometric parameters such as ultrasound, CT scanning or magnetic resonance imaging. Inflammatory changes of the extraocular muscles lead to an impairment of eye movement. Recent evidence suggests that saccades are altered by changes to the extraocular muscles. Although of potential interest, this phenomenon has so far received little attention. To determine the role of saccades as a potential diagnostic tool for assessing the function of the affeced muscles, we have begun to analyze saccadic parameters in patients with TAO. Preliminary results of this study are reported in the present paper. For registration of both horizontal and vertical eye movements, we used the "Ober-2-Apparatus," which uses the infrared technique. Horizontal and vertical saccades with an amplitude of 10 ° were analyzed in 20 healthy persons and 30 patients suffering from TAO. Patients showed changes in the quality of saccades, such as the appearance of glissades and additional correctional saccades as well as quantitative changes, such as an increase in the maximum speed and latency. Our current data suggest the presence of saccadic alterations in TAO. Our ongoing studies are designed to evaluate whether characteristic changes can be assigned to certain stages of the disease and whether assessment of saccadic changes in a promising tool for early detection and functional follow-up in patients with TAO.
