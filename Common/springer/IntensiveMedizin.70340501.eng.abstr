 Chronic respiratory failure (CRF) is caused by a decrease in the capacity of the respiratory muscles (e. g., neuromuscular diseases), or an increase in load (e. g., kypho-scoliosis or obstructive lung disease) or both. CRF is characterized by hypercapnia and hypoxemia. The degree of hypercapnia is directly related to the increase of the load and decrease of the capacity of the respiratory muscles and acts, therefore, as an indicator.
