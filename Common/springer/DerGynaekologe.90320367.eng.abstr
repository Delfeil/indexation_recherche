The increase in cardiac output during pregnancy depends on the increase of preload due to increase of blood volume and reduction of afterload due to reduction of systemic vessel resistance. This increase in stroke volume in the course of pregnancy and its normalization after delivery can be measured by means of Doppler ultrasound either as systolic peak velocity or as time-velocity integral.
