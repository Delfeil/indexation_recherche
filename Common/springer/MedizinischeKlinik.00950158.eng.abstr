Background: Livedo reticularis generalisata (LR) in combination with affection of CNS is referred to as Sneddon's syndrome (SNS). Latest data suggest chronic progressive systemic disorder with occlusion of small and medium sized vessels (e. g., cutis, brain, kidneys, heart, eyes). No conclusive etiology is known, though there are correlations to the antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic secondary vasculitis and coagulopathies. Hereditary and toxic factors seem to play a role in pathogenesis in some cases.
