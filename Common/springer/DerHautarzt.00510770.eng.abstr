A 64-year-old woman presented with extensive erythematous papulosquamous lesions along the lines of Blaschko on the right half of the trunk and the right leg. The clinical and histological features led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis which usually appears during childhood. Treatment with acitretin led to marked improvement. Lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - particulary "blaschkitis of adulthood" as first described in 1990 - are discussed.
