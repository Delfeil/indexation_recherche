The incidence of primary cerebral lymphomas has risen continuously during the past years. The neuroradiological signs, which are decisive for the differential diagnosis of cerebral lymphomas, are worked up and discussed in this study. Thirty CT and 27 MR investigations of a total of 32 patients (14 males, 18 females, age 60 +/- 15 years) with histopathologically proven cerebral lymphomas were analysed retrospectively. Multiple cerebral lymphomas were detected in 10/32 patients (31%). The cerebral lymphomas appeared on CT scans as hyperdense masses in 28/30 cases (93%). On T2-weighted MR scans 14/27 (52%) lymphomas were slightly hyperintense compared to white matter and 9/27 (33%) inhomogeneously isointense to poorly hyperintense.
