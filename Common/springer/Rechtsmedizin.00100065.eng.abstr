All drug-related deaths registered in the institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Aachen, Germany, during the time period of February 1994-February 1998 were examined and approximately 20% (19/102) were considered to be associated with methadone. Although the number of patients involved in methadone maintenance programms had increased by tenfold, the number of methadone-associated deaths remained relatively constant. Polydrug toxicity was the leading cause of death. Of the licit methadone substituted patients died two thirds during the first 3 days of treatment. According to the police investigations, all had received an induction dose that exceeded the recommended amount and some were intolerant to opiates. All fatalities showed irregularities concerning the methadone distribution practice and this highlights the need for adequate supervision of methadone treatment.
