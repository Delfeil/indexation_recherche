The estrogen concentrations obtained with transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) are closer to the premenopausal methods than those yielded by any other method currently available. Constant estradiol concentrations are achieved, comparable with those seen earlier in the follicular phase. When hormone replacement therapy is given by mouth, the dosage of estradiol needed to reach effective active ingredient levels is 40 times that used for TTS treatment, and then the levels fluctuate markedly with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal nadirs. The high doses are needed for oral administration because estrogen is very strongly metabolized during passage through the liver.
