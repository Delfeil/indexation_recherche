Fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the unborn child's life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally. Such surgery is a clinical reality now. Indications for intrataurine surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities, especially in the upper respiratory tract. These include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias, prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary overdistension, and resection of embryonic tumors that obstruct the respiratory tract. The relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques. Endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance. In part of the procedures, only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use. Further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions, even in cases with non-lethal conditions. More diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications. One example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate, which until now has only been performed in animal experiments. The particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy. This offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is invisible externally and avoids growth-impeding scars. The particular ethical and legal aspects of fetal surgery are discussed.
