The intramedullary hip screw system Classic-Nail and the Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) were evaluated in a prospective-randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures. Hundred and ten geriatric patients (mean age 82 years) were runningly included in the study (56 Classic Nail, 54 DHS). No significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow-up data. With the Classic-Nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occured at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires. In the DHS group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively. At an avarage follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups. - Classic Nail and DHS both lead to equally good results in the operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures.
