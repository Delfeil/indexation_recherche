 Background: To find out the incidence of spontaneous pubertal development in girls with Turner syndrome we investigated patients with a bone age of at least eleven years.  Results: 6 out of 17 patients showed spontaneous puberty. There exists no clear correlation between karyotype and phenotype on the one hand and incidence of spontaneous puberty on the other. Basal as well as stimulated gonadotropin levels in the late childhood could better indicate spontaneous puberty in Turner syndrome.  Conclusion: In contrast to the generally held opinion spontaneous pubertal development is not rare in girls with Turner syndrome. Therefore estrogen replacement therapy should be started only after it became certain that there will be no spontaneous puberty.
