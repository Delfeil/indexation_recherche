 Hemorrhoidal disease is the most common pathophysiologic abnormality in the anus in the western civilized world. Sixty years after publication of the method in The Lancet, hemorrhoidectomy according to Milligan and Morgan and modifications of their method are still considered the standard procedure in cases of advanced hemorrhoidal disease. During the last 5 years, 107 patients underwent hemorrhoidectomy in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cologne. In most of these patients, the operation followed Milligan and Morgan's method. There were 69 males and 38 females with a mean age of 47.9 years. Mean length of hospital stay was 4.5 days. We saw one case of postoperative bleeding that required operative review. The patients' risk profile (age, concomitant diseases, ASA classification) did not influence the length of the hospital stay. Operative hemorrhoidectomy according to Milligan and Morgan allows a short stay in hospital according to the individual needs of the patient, with a high degree of safety concerning possible postoperative complications.
