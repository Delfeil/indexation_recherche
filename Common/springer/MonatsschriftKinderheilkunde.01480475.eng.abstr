Case report: A 16-month-old girl was admitted with a 6-month history of multiple redishblue plaques on the right abdomen. These proved to have increased in size and number daturing a 1.5-year follow-up. Histologically (including histochemistry and electron microscopy), these skin changes were classified as tufted angioma. Tufted angioma is a rare, often multiple benign tumor. Half of the tumors reported develop in children 5 years and younger. The exclusion of malignant tumors (leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma) is important. A punch biopsy is not very traumatic. A subsequent histological examination is highly sensitive and specific.
