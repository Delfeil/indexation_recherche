Background: Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a paradoxical adduction of the vocal cords appearing more often during inspiration than during exspiration. It occurs in patients with asthma, but may also be present without other respiratory tract diseases. Symptoms of VCD are often misdiagnosed and mistreated as asthma. In early childhood VCD is rare and rather occurs in older children and adolescents.
