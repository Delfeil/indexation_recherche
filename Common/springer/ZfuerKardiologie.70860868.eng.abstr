 Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) remains a major problem after heart transplantation. This prospective study was performed to analyze the value of quantitative dobutamine stress echocardiography for the diagnosis of CAV compared with coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In 80 patients late (>= 12 months) after cardiac transplantation, a total of 144 studies were evaluated.
