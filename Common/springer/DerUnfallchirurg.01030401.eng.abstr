The possibility of a specific origin of joint infection should be considered in finding the diagnosis. This is demonstrated in a case of tuberculosis of the hip treated in the Dept. of Trauma Surgery in collaboration with the Medical Dept. of the Klinikum Minden. Microbiological and imaging examinations are essential to plan and perform a combined therapy of hip arthroplasty and concomittant medical antituberculous therapy. In accordance to a literature review, this procedure proved successful for both eliminating the local infection and the functional outcome of the operation.
