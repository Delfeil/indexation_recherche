Telepathology, defined as the practice of pathology over a distance by viewing images transmitted from a remote site, was previously analyzed mainly with respect to technical equipment and diagnostic accuracy compared with conventional histological diagnosis. In this paper, telepathology is analyzed with regard to economic points of view, demonstrating the background for the cost-benefit analysis of telepathology. The acquisition cost and the operating costs of a telepathology system are compared with potential cost-saving and other benefits from telepathology. This analysis may help to decide whether or not telepathology should be established in a hospital.
