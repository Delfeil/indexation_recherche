  Purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of intraoperative echocardiography in the assessment of surgical repair of congenitally malformed hearts. In 235 of 508 patients who underwent cardiac surgery during a one year period transesophageal intraoperative echocardiography was performed. This was done to exclude residual ventricular septal defects or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (n=84), to evaluate results of AV valve reconstruction (n=61), to assess ventricular function following arterial switch operation for complete transposition or in complex heart defects palliated by a Fontan-type procedure (n=50), to assess repair of left ventricular outflow obstruction (n=22) and for miscellaneous defects (n=18). Residual defects leading to immediate reoperation during the same surgical session were found in 4 patients (1.7%), minor residual defects not requiring reoperation were present in 6 patients (2.6%). In 2 patients with complete AV septal defect the left AV valves were only mildly regurgitant immediately after reconstruction but subsequent suture deshiscence required later reopoeration. Echocardiographic data were supplemented by direct pressure measurements in the ventricles and contrast injection into the left atrium. We conclude that intraoperative echocardiography can provide useful clinical informations, if its findings are interpreted in context with pressure measurements and contrast injections.
