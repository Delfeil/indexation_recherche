  Operative treatment for chronic venous insufficiency has existed for more than a century. Selective dissection of perforating veins as a causal treatment originated with the work of Cockett in 1953. Since then, less invasive techniques for dissection of Cockett's perforating veins have been developed. So long as no tissue induration is present, extrafascial operations have the advantage. These include not only the classical method of May, but also minimally invasive methods such as those propagated by Klapp, Bassi and Feuerstein. In recent years, significant progress has been made in surgical treatment of severe insufficiency of Cockett's perforating veins with dermolipofasciosclerosis and leg ulcer. The intrafascial technique avoids the extensive tissue trauma of earlier times, with its concomitant risk of severely disturbed wound healing. Today's method of choice is endoscopic dissection following the recommendations of Hauer and Fischer. Hach's operation retains value as a smaller-scale and less expensive technique.
