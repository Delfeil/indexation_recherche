Abstract.  We describe the case of a 67-year-old man with an electricity inflicted injury in the left hand and a transscaphoidal perilunear dislocation of the opposite right hand. On admission, the injury was missed on the standard ap-radiogram of the right hand, so the operative reconstruction was delayed. Later on, the lunate showed aseptic necrosis and wrist collapse as consequence.
