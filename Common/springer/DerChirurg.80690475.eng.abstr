 Perforation into the heart is a rare ulcer complication in a hiatal hernia. Because of the massive bleeding, medical help is often in vain. The case of a 73-year-old patient reported by our department confirms this. Endoscopic treatment was not possible because of the extraordinary amount of blood in the stomach, and the high intraoperative blood loss was lethal. If gastric ulcers occur in upper regions of the stomach, the possibility of the presence of an paraesophageal hernia and elective surgical treatment must be considered.
