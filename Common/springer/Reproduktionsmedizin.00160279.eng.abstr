Erectile failure after radical prostatectomy is a common postoperative disorder. However, nerve-sparing technique provides in about 50-60 % erections sufficient for sexual intercourse. Damage to the cavernous nerves or vascular injuries are responsible for erectile dysfunction. Alprostadil is most commonly used for self-injection monotherapy or in combination with other vasoactive drugs. Intraurethral administration of alprostadil failed to reproduce promising early results. The oral drug Sildenafil showed to be effective in patients with partial erections, however, it failed to work after non nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. Negative pressure devices and penile prosthesis can be considered as alternative therpeutic options. Autologous N. suralis transplantation during radical prostatectomy might further improve erection rates in the near future.
