Objective: Recent evidence suggests a possible role for Haeme oxygenase (HO)-derived carbon monoxide (CO) in the regulation of vascular tone through elevation of cyclic 3'-5' guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Previous work from our laboratory has shown that blockade of the HO pathway by tin-protoporphyrin-IX (SnPP) after resuscitation from haemorrhage leads to a specific and profound increase in portal resistance while neither systemic nor hepatic arterial resistance are affected. We therefore investigated the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducible protein haeme oxygenase-1/heat shock protein 32 after haemorrhage and resuscitation.
