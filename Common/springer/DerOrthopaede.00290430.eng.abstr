The importance of osteotomies in treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head has decreased. However, with proper selection of the patient, osteotomies are still useful for small stage III or IV lesions in patients younger than 45 years, and with no ongoing causes for progressive osteonecrosis such as the use of high doses of corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and chronic alcoholism. For preservation of natural hip joint function, the necrotic segment is moved away from the load-transmitting area of the acetabulum, and weight-bearing forces are redistributed to articular cartilage that is supported by healthy bone. In addition to radiographic evaluation, MRI is most accurate for imaging of the stage, localization, and extent of osteonecrosis in planning and selecting osteotomy.
