Purpose: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of the photoreceptors by catalysis of membrane outer segments and via choriocapillary perfusion is also exposed to the regulation of blood lipid levels. Since the uptake and metabolism of cholesterol are mediated by specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, expression and regulation of this receptortype were studied in RPE cultures.
