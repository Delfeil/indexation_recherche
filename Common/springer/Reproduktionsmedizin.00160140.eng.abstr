Besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics, the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus. Thus, physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics. Very early, i. e. in 1984, the German Medical Association developed professional laws for reproductive medicine. In addition, the German government saw the need in 1990 for an "Embryo Protection Law" (Embryonenschutzgesetz). Today, in the light of European integration, the medical profession's and state's obligations are challenged in different ways. Whereas the German Medical Association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics - currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the government must develop the sociolegal framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine, i. e. , in the areas of inheritance law, adoption law, family law, and law of succession, the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs. social paternity in heterologous insemination.
