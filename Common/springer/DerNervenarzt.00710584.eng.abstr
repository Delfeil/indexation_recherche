We present the case of a 16-year-old girl with a 12-year history of trichotillomania and trichotillophagia in combination with mental retardation and early childhood deprivation, all contributing to the growth of a stomach ulcer and an oversized, stomach-shaped trichobezoar which had to be removed by gastrotomy. Included are a discussion of psychodynamic aspects, therapeutic strategies, and significant literature, concluding with a short, historic view on the varieties and therapy of bezoars.
