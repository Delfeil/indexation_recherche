Selecting a route for drug administration during CPR requires consideration of the speed with which access can be obtained, the technical difficulties involved in performing the procedure, the associated risk of complications, delays in drug delivery to the central circulation, and the duration of effective drug levels following injection. The peripheral venous route is the safest method, and drug delivery can be enhanced by a fluid bolus after injection of the medication. The circulation time is shortest after central venous injection, but there is some risk of complications. The femoral route is associated with a high incidence of unsuccessful catherization. The endotracheal tube provides an accessible route for administration of most drugs, but peak concentrations are lower than those obtained by other routes. While the results are almost the same as an intravenous injection, the intraosseous route is currently underrepresented in clinical practice. This method must not only be considered in pediatric patients, but in adult patients as well.
