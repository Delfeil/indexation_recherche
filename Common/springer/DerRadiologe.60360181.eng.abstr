In the present paper, common disorders of the oral cavity and oropharynx are described with special emphasis on differential diagnostic aspects. The first part of this presentation covers different inflammatory diseases, mainly focusing on complications like peritonsillar, para- and retropharyngeal abscesses, and Ludwig's angina. These clinical entities can lead to further life-threatening complications, including deep neck infections and mediastinitis. The diagnostic value and necessity of modern imaging in these cases are emphasized. In the second part, the author reports on the incidence, etiology and clinical course of tumors of the oral cavity and oropharynx with special regard to malignancies. Tumors in these areas have been increasing in number over the past decades mainly due to changes in alcohol and nicotine consumption in the developed countries. Diagnostic management includes a thorough clinical evaluation as well as modern imaging for tumor delineation and possible bone infiltration, depending on the site of the original tumor. In addition, therapeutic considerations are discussed, focusing on surgical tumor removal and soft tissue replacement using different pedicled flaps and free flaps. It is also emphasized that postoperative radiotherapy is mandatory in most malignant tumors in this area.
