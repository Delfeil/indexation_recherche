 A 36-year-old patient experienced spontaneous pain in the left side together with the symptoms of intermittent claudication. Investigation revealed left renal infarction as well as dissection of the pelvic arteries on both sides due to fibromuscular dysplasia of the intimal type. One year after implantation of an aorto-bifemoral bypass, the patient is symptom free. The patient's remaining renal artery continues to show no signs of pathological changes.
