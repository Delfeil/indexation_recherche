 Emergency medicine and critical care are fields that often require rapid diagnosis and intervention for specific situations. Narrow QRS tachycardia is a cardiac rhythm with a rate faster than 100/min and a QRS duration <0.12 s. Causes of narrow QRS tachycardia (N-QRS-T) are sinus tachycardia (ST), atrial tachycardia (AT), AV nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), circus movement tachycardia (CMT), atrial flutter (AFlut) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). A systematic ECG approach with evaluation of spontaneous AV block, QRS alternans, P wave location and P wave polarity permits correct identification of the underlying arrhythmia mechanism and the origin of the arrhythmia. In hemodynamically unstable N-QRS-T, electrical DC cardioversion should be performed immediately. If the hemodynamic situation is stable, vagal maneuvers (Valsalva, carotis sinus massage) are indicated; if unsuccessful, drugs are therapeutic alternatives. In ST, beta-blocking agents (metoprolol 15 mg i.v.) are successful; in AT and AVNRT adenosine (6-18 mg bolus i.v.) and ajmaline (50-100 mg i.v.) are preferred. In patients (pts) with CMT, ajmaline (50-100 mg i.v.) is an ideal drug with high success rates. When vagal maneuvers or pharmacologic interventions fail to suppress the N-QRS-T, DC cardioversion is necessary. For pts with AFib principles of therapy are restoration of sinus rhythm (RSR) or ventricular rate control. Direct current cardioversion can restore sinus rhythm in up to 90% of pts with AFib. No single agent has emerged as the drug of choice for converting AFib; however, RSR is possible with propafenone (600 mg oral), flecainide (300mg oral) or sotalol (80-160 mg oral). Ventricular rate control is an important component in pts with AFib. Verapamil (5-10 mg i.v.) and digoxin (0.4 mg i.v.) are effective drugs in reducing resting ventricular rates in pts with established AFib. Three options are available for acute treatment of AFlut: rapid atrial pacing, DC cardioversion or administration of propafenone (600 mg oral) or flecainide (300 mg oral).
