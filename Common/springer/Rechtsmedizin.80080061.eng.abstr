 The use of a sex-specific "average-r" of 0.6 for females and 0.7 for males for calculating blood ethanol concentration based on specified quantities of drinks contains relatively many errors because individual factors affecting the size of errors are not taken into consideration. These deviations may be minimized by including the total bodyweight and the proportion of fat into the r-calculation. However, the coefficient of correlation specified by 0.442 does not by any means give a satisfactory result. By combining the formula for calculating the total body water empirically obtained by Watson et al. with bodyweight, size, age, and body fat as points of reference we developed two new formulas allowing the calculation of an individual r for each person. Using these formulas 99.1% of the calculated r can be covered. However, the registration of anthopological numerical values to do calculations for individual and initial quantities can negatively affect the practical use of these formulas.
