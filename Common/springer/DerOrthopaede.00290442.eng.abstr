Osteonecrosis of the femoral head remains a devastating disease for young patients. As the normal process of bone formation, bone destruction, and fracture healing becomes more clearly understood, molecular agents - including cytokines, bone morphogenetic proteins, and angiogenic factors - will be identified as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of osteonecrosis. As the pathology of osteonecrosis and repair of osteonecrotic lesions becomes clear, the potential combination of these molecular factors to influence the outcome of the disease in its repair process should become evident.
