The deepithelialized "turn-over-flap" is a reversed dermis flap. The pedicle of the flap remains intact. The mobile upper part of the flap is turned over the defect and the pedicle itself. A mesh graft covers both, the flap and the donor side. Two case reports will present the principles of the flap design and the clinical outcome of a patient with a defect over the lateral malleolar region and a patient with a defect over the Achilles tendon.
