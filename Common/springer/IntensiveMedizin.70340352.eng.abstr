 In Germany, ethics committees are established at the medical faculties of universities as well as at the Chamber of Physicians of the different states (Landesärztekam-mern). They are independent institutions which review for approval of research projects in human subjects, according to the law and to the declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines of "good clinical practice" (GCP). They examine the research project on the basis of ethical and scientific principles and the legal regulations. Thus they are mainly comparable to the "Institutional Review Boards" in the USA and not to the "ethics committee".
