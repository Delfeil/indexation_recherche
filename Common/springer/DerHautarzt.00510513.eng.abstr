Subcutaneous panniculitic T-cell lymphoma is categorized as a subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Patients typically present with nontender subcutaneous nodules. The characteristic histologic features include the presence of atypical lymphocytes and benign macrophages that infiltrate between the adipocytes of the subcutis mimicking panniculitis. We report a 75-year old patient with a three week history of asymptomatic subcutaneous nodules. The diagnosis of subcutaneous T-cell lymphoma was confirmed by immunohistological and molecular biolological studies. Chemotherapy had to be interrupted due to a rapid worsening of the patient's general condition. She died few weeks after confirmation of diagnosis.
