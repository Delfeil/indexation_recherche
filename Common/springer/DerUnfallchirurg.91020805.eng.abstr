Despite the many benefits of prone positioning in critically ill patients with respiratory failure and ARDS in the ICU, its technical problems have not yet been adequately resolved. Different approaches with special beds for prone positioning do exist, but these devices are difficult to handle, often not available and involve high costs. With this in mind, we developed an easy handling prone positioning system (MBS) that requires no special beds and runs at low cost. The MBS is a cost-effective device, yielding many benefits for prone positioning in critically ill patients with severe athelectasis and ARDS.
