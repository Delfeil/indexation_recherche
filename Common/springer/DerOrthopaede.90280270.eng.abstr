Introduction: With the German health care restructuring legislation ("Gesundheitsstrukturgesetz") the coding of diagnoses and operations according to ICD-9 and ICPM (OPS-301) was introduced for budget assignment ("Fallpauschalen/Sonderentgelte"). Methods: Application of the structured coding system "do it" in orthopeadics and traumatology in combination with a surgical documentation system. Results of 8,664 documented operative cases within three years. Results: In total, 11,854 ICD-9 or ICD-10 and 20,178 ICPM (OPS-301) were coded. 2,914 "Fallpauschalen" and/or 3,456 "Sonderentgelte" were found. The System achieved high acceptance due to its userfriendliness and simple functionality. Discussion: In comparison with text- or thesaurus-based coding systems the "do it" coding system does not require any knowledge of the ICD or ICPM (OPS-301). It can be adapted to individual clinical requirements by implementing frequent diagnoses and individual therapy concepts. In combination with a medical information system the coding system can be integrated seamlessly into routine documentation.
