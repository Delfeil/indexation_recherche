We examined 38 patients with an arthroscopic bioabsorbable tack repair for anterior shoulder instability in a prospective evaluation. The mean follow-up was 22 months (range 12 to 33). The average age was 28.4 years (range 15 to 57), the operation was performed at average of 50 months (3 to 244 months) after injury. Assessment using the Rowe score revealed excellent results in 33 and good results in 3 patients. 1 patient had a fair result and 1 had a poor result. 26 shoulders obtained full range of motion, 11 had minor (< 10  °) loss of external rotation, 1 experienced greater (< 20  °) loss of external rotation. 3 of the 38 patients (8 %) had recurrent instability, 1 patient with 2 preceding operations and atraumatic and voluntary dislocation, respectively. The recurrence rate of arthroscopic Bankart repair with bioabsorbable tacks are comparable to open Bankart procedures. Success of the procedure depends on appropriate surgical technique and suitable selection of patients with unidirectional, posttraumatic, anterior instability who are found to have well-developed ligamentous tissue.
