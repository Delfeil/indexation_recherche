We report our experience with the arthroscopic reduction and percutaneous fixation (ARPF) of tibial plateau fractures based on a prospective study with clinical and radiological follow-up data of 38 patients with 40 fractures. The goal of the study was to prove the well-known advantages of arthroscopy with little soft tissue dissection because of small surgical access routes, the possibility of arthroscopic debridement of the joint and treatment of associated injuries to evaluate the almost standardized technique of minimally invasive surgery using aiming devices, cannulated screws, and fluoroscopy. We try to answer the question of whether the results with the ARPF are as good or better than traditional methods of open reduction and internal fixation.
