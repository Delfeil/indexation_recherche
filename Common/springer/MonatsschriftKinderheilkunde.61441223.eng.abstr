Problem: Clinical and ultrasound data of neonatal hips were analysed to answer the question whether a neonatal screening is necessary or not. Method: Children born between 1. 1. 1991 and 31. 3. 1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound. The data were analysed by SPSS/PC. Results: 5069 children with 10 138 hips were examined. 85 % were mature (type I), 14 % were physiologically immature (type IIa) and 1.2 % were pathological (IIc, D, IIIa). The comparison shows, that from 119 hips with pathological ultrasound findings only 44 (37 %) had positive clinical findings. A screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors (positive family history or breech position) would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time.
