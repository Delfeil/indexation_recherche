Purpose: Evaluation of frequency-selective fat saturation (FS) and short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) fat suppression (FU) in MRI of patients with malignant head and neck tumors.  Methods: Forty-five patients with biopsy-proven carcinomas of the extracranial head and neck were examined with MRI at 1.0 T. A T 2-weighted TSE sequence with and without STIR-FU and a T 1-weighted SE sequence with and without FS were compared in axial slices.  Results: STIR-FU was successful in all and FS in 85-88 % of the head examinations (nasopharynx, sinuses, oropharynx, and oral cavity) and 33-46 % of the neck examinations (hypopharynx and larynx). When visualization and delineation of tumors were ranked on a four-point scale (0-3), respective mean values for images with/without FU or FS were 2.6/1.9 for T 2-TSE in all examinations, 2.2/1.7 (nasopharynx and sinuses) and 1.3/1.4-1.6 (oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx) for T 1-SE without contrast media administration (CM) and 2.3/2.1 (nasopharynx and sinuses) and 2.4-2.5/1.9-2.0 (oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx) with CM.  Conclusions: STIR-T 2-TSE was a technically reliable pathfinder for localization and extension of both tumors and lymph nodes. FS-T 1-SE was technically unreliable in examinations of the hypopharynx and larynx. With CM, FS-T 1-SE was most useful for MRI of carcinomas of the oral cavity and oropharynx. In the nasopharynx and sinuses, T 1-SE with CM and FS-T 1-SE with or without CM were equal for tu- mor visualization and delineation.
