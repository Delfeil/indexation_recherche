We report on a patient who suffered chylothorax 2 months after she had undergone internal fixation of a fracture of her 12th thoracic vertebral body. The pleural effusion was treated by insertion of a chest tube. The chylothorax was managed conservatively. The patient received protein-rich nutrition supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides. As the volume of chylous fluid drained from the pleura had not decreased after 2 weeks, the patient received total parenteral nutrition without any oral intake of calories. Chest X-rays documented the disappearance of the chylothorax. Reexpansion of the lungs was noted, and the costophrenic sinuses could be clearly visualised.
