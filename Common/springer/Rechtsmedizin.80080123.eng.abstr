 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal transmissible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of protease-resistant prion protein (PrPSc) in the central nervous system (CNS). The disease occurs worldwide with a frequency of one case per million inhabitants per year. The definite diagnosis relies on histological or biochemical investigation of brain tissue. Pathological hallmarks are spongiform changes of the neuropil, gliosis and nerve cell loss. Clinically the disease is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia and the involvement of different neurological systems such as cerebellar ataxia, visual impairment, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs of varying severity. In the late stage, myocloni and characteristic periodic sharp waves in the electroencephalogram are often seen. CJD occurs sporadically in 90% of cases. In 10% it is caused by a mutation in the prion protein gene (PRNP). Other familial prion diseases are the Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). This article gives a short overview of the current pathophysiological concept of the prion diseases, clinical and diagnostical aspects, the new variant CJD and its connection to BSE. It proposes safety rules for autopsy and decontamination and points out new forensic aspects.
