Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a clinicopathological syndrome of unknown etiology. Histopathologically, it is characterized by plugs of fibroplastic connective tissue within respiratory bronchioles, mononuclear cell infiltrates in parenchyma adjacent to the affected bronchioles and foam cells within alveolar airspaces. The disease usually presents as a subacute illness with complete resolution. A subset of BOOP, however, is associated with a fulminant course and a high lethality due to respiratory failure. Early diagnosis and therapy are mandatory. Chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and open lung biopsy are the primary diagnostic techniques. Radiographically, BOOP is characterized by patchy areas of consolidation that are usually bilateral, peripheral and often migratory. In some cases small, round opacities may be observed as the only abnormality. CT can show the pattern of ground glass opacities, areas of airspace consolidation and small, round opacities, while considerable fibrotic change is usually not seen. A reticular roentgenographic pattern, fibrotic changes mainly in subpleural location at CT, lack of lymphocytosis in BAL fluid and histological features of usual interstitial pneumonitis and BOOP in biopsy specimens are all considered risk factors for a fatal outcome.
