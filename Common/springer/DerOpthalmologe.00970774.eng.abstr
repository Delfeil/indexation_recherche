Purpose. Short wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) is a sensitive method in detection of early glaucomatous damage. In this study, we compared intra-subject variability of global indices of SWAP and conventional white-on-white perimetry (WWP) in normal clinical conditions (without correction for lens yellowing).
