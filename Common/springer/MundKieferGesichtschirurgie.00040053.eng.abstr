Paragangliomas of the glomus caroticum are relatively rare, but highly vascularized neoplasmas, which develop from chemoreceptors. They can be develop at anyage, but most often in the third or fourth decade of life. Paragangliomas grow very slowly and are most always of benign origin. There is a familial predisposition, and an autosomal-dominant transmission is presumed. They are commonly located in the jugular region; in rare cases a polytopic manifestation is found. We describe the case of a 47-year-old male patient who was referred to our department because of a progressive swelling of the neck on both sides. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography had displayed soft tissue tumors in the jugular regions. We performed an operative exploration, which showed a highly vascularized tumor. Histopathologic analysis revealed the diagnosis of a paraganglioma. An angiography of the neck and thoracic region, furthermore, revealed an additional paraganglioma in the anterior mediastinum. Using a surgical approach via lateral cervicotomies and thoracotomy the paragangliomas were extirpated. Our case report demonstrates the rare polytopic manifestation of paragangliomas. This perivascular neoplasms have to be removed before haemodynamic complications develop. The extent of this tumors is clearly illustrated by use of an angiography. Because of the familial predisposition, clinical and radiological examinations of relatives are mandatory.
