  The treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge. We report on a 12 year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to NHL-BFM 95: Block AA protocol. During his therapy, he developed a thrombosis of his right femoral vein and pulmonary embolism affecting the left segments 4, 5, 8, and 9. Because of cerebral metastasis a fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicated. Therefore, we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the Amplatz thrombectomy device. The postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion; dopplersonography 4 months postinterventionally showed a patent right femoral vein.
