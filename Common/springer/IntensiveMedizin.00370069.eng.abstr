Abstract Despite medical therapy, chronic heart failure can often only be treated using a mechanical assist system. The results, when using such devices electively, underline that it is an effective therapy. In many patients, "dependent" organs, such as liver or kidneys etc., can regain their usual function soon after adequate circulatory function is reestablished by the mechanical assist system. In patients with NYHA class IV heart failure and contraindications for heart transplantation, implantation of a long-lasting system is an alternative approach, even though available systems do not yet last forever. Post-cardiosurgical implantation of an assist device is the only option in some patients. The good results are rewarding the high technical and personal efforts if no major-complications, such as thromboembolism, bleedings or infections, occur. Postoperative treatment of these patients requires special training of all those involved.
