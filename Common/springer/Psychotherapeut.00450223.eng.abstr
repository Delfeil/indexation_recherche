The aim of the study was to predict the psychotherapy-outcome in 65 inpatients with psychosomatic disorders by the "Erwachsenen-Bindungsprototypen-Rating - EBPR  (i.e. Adult Attachement-Prototypes Rating) - Strauﬂ u. Lobo-Drost" and by interpersonal problems (IIP; Horowitz). Only attachment security (but none of the attachment prototypes) was a weak but significant predictor of individual therapeutic goal attainment. Premature breaking off, another outcome criterium, was significantly correlated with "autocratic" interpersonal behavior.
