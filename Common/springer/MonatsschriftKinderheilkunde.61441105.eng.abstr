 Despite the decreasing incidence of tuberculosis there is stagnation of the number of tuberculin convertors in Berlin. As possible reason for these positive skin tests with a high dosage of tuberculin cross reactions with so-called atypical mycobacteria infections are suspected. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the diagnostic value of intradermally perform-ed Mendel-Mantoux-Test with 100 TU as well as with M. avium sensitin in multiple puncture tuberculin test positive children. 11 375 tuberculin skin tests in non-BCG-vaccinated children were performed between January 1992 and September 1993; 188 positive multiple puncture tuberculin test results could be detected. 64 study-participants have been retested with Mendel-Mantoux-Test (100 TU) and M. avium sensitin. 31 children (48 %) did not react to both tests. In 33 children (52 %), positive multiple puncture tests could be confirmed by intracutanous testing with 100 TU. 18 (55 %) of these children showed a positive reaction only to tuberculin, 15 (45 %) to M. avium sensitin as well. It can be assumed that these children, who reacted only with 100 TU were infected with M. tuberculosis. A cross reaction with nontuberculous mycobacteria can not be excluded in the remaining children who showed reactions to tuberculin as well as to M. avium sensitin.
