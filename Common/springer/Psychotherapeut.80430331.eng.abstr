Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy represent independent approaches to patients with a psychiatric disorder. Both, however, may be combined in an integrative model of treatment which is based upon multifactorial etiopathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. A combination treatment must especially take into account the psychology of prescribing and taking drugs. Conscious and unconscious meanings attributed to medication in the psychotherapeutic alliance must be reflected in order to make pharmacotherapy safe. In addition, they mediate important transference and countertransference reactions during the various phases of psychotherapy. Empirical studies are surveyed in respect of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and combination treatment for non-psychotic disorders (depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality disorders, borderline personality disorder).
