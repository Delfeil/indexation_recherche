The giant cell synovialoma is a benign neoplasia classically located in the fingers. It mostly rises from tendon sheaths, sometimes from the synovia. Other locations than the fingers are rare. Making a differential diagnosis to lipomas, gangliomas or even malignant soft tissue tumors can be very difficult especially in rare locations. We report the case of a 21 years old man suffering from a giant cell synovialoma in the area of the right ankle joint. The clinical, radiological and patho-morphological findings are documented. The tumor was excised totally, other foci were not found. The problems of making the right diagnosis are described.
