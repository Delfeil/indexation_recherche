Oncocytomas of the minor salivary glands are uncommon epithelial tumors. Their occurrence is controversial because the formation of metastases and histological criteria of malignancy such as hypercellularity in connection with nuclear pleomorphism and local aggressive growth, have been described in only single cases. We report a case of a 66-year-old woman who was found to have an oncocytic adenoma localized in her left laryngeal vestibular ligament. Because no signs of malignancy could be found in our case the tumor was classified histologically as primary benign. We emphasize that thorough histological examination of oncocytic tumors and close clinical supervi-sion are necessary. A general overview of the available literature and the histological classification of oncocytomas is given.
