Apnea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care. The prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment, however, are controversial. The universal aim, in order to prevent traumatization of the lung, is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible. Therefore drugs such as theophylline, aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal CPAP have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit. In these studies we developed a treatment algorithm. In two clinically controlled studies performed successively we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline. As aminophylline has more side effects, sodium acetate theophylline is preferable. Bradycardia, apnea and desaturation were registered from the print-out of the monitoring system's trend analysis and in a polysomnographic study during steady-state conditions. In a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration. We demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline; however, doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first 3 days of treatment. In a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal CPAP as the third level of treatment. The rate of bradycardia, apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during CPAP and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved. The algorithm developed established theophylline with 5 mg/ kg as bolus infusion over 20 min, followed by 3 mg/kg BID as the first line of treatment. Only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice (indication >=4 bradycardias below 80/min, 4 desaturations below 80% or 2 apneas of >=20 s over 2 h). After 48 h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe >=3 apneas, 15 bradycardias or 15 desaturations over this period. Nasal CPAP was introduced as the third line of treatment. With this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from 4.9 to 3.4 days (P<0.01). An evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi-institutional studies is indicated.
