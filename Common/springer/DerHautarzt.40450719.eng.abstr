Abstract.  We report on the case of a 70-year-old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a lipodermoid of the left eye. This rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient. The naevus spread on the left side from parietal to retroauricular, nuchal and sternal. Because of the patient's cardio-pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia. We also made a partial stripped excision of the left-sided parietal parts of the naevus.
