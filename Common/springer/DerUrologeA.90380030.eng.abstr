After unsuccessful medical treatment of a neurogenic hyperreflexive bladder dysfunction further treatment options are the ileal bladder augmentation, the detrusor-myectomy (bladder auto-augmentation) and the sacral root deafferentation. All techniques lead to a low-pressure bladder with enlarged storage volume. The authors here report about their personal experience with the detrusor myectomy in 62 patients with hyperreflexive neurogenic bladder dysfunction from 1989 until 1998. Indication, surgical technique, and long-time results are presented.
