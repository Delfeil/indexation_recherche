Aware-state surgery has been used in this unit to identify the source of spinal pain in over 2500 patients as part of a process termed "viviprudence". This process consists of clinical analysis, dynamic radiology and scanning tested by differential discography, endoscopy and patient feedback. This replaces guesswork with sighted diagnosis and allows keyhole tissue-preserving techniques to be used not only for the treatment of compressive radiculopathy but also for back pain, failed back syndrome, perineural scarring, multilevel degenerative disc disease, lateral recess stenosis and dynamic listhesis. This has led to the identification of new pathology and the refinement of the inclusion criteria for laser disc decompression and endoscopic laser foraminoplasty. Since 1994, an endoscopic system has been developed to explore the intervertebral foramen and epidural space via the postero-lateral route. The system has been used to address lateral recess stenosis, epidural scarring, osteophytosis, settlement, listhesis, disc extrusion and sequestration and failed back syndrome. The objective has been the endoscopic aware-state definition of the source of pain with decompression of the foramen, mobilisation and neurolysis of the exiting and transiting nerves and ablation of osteophytes and other causes of failed back syndrome confirmed endoscopically. This prospective study involved day-case endoscopic laser foraminoplasty performed on 101 men, and 99 women with an average age of 56 years (range, 22-83 years). They were followed for an average period of 34 months (range, 26-43 months). The average preoperative duration of symptoms was 5.6 years (range, 5-11 years). A total of 46 patients had had one to four previous open operations, and 14 patients were on narcotic analgesics prior to surgery. At other centres, 106 of these patients were evaluated and open surgical procedures were not deemed appropriate or likely to benefit. A cohort integrity of 96% was maintained at the final follow-up. Back, buttock and leg pain were separately compared and analysed using the Oswestry Disability Index, a patient satisfaction scoring scale, a visual analogue pain scale and a patient target achievement score. Using an Oswestry Disability Index of 50 or more to determine good and excellent outcomes, 55% of patients exceeded this score for back pain, 52% for buttock pain and 53% for leg pain. In patients with one prior operation, the corresponding figures were 51%, 33% and 29%. These results indicate that endoscopic laser foraminoplasty provides a minimalist means of exploring the extraforaminal zone, the foramen and the epidural space and performing discectomy, osteophytectomy and neurolysis. It incorporates the prophylactic advantage of foraminal undercutting and provides a promising means of identifying and treating the pain of failed back surgery and back pain and sciatica of indeterminate origin. It serves to identify and localise the source of pain generation. Endoscopic laser foraminoplasty avoids the morbidity associated with open spinal surgery and serves as a useful means of effecting keyhole neurolysis without extensive exploration and fusion. Current improvements in equipment promise wider application and more encouraging results in the future.
