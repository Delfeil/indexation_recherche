Description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes, which requires dialysis, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, who developed fulminant systemic calciphylaxis after successful renal transplantation. Characteristic of this syndrome, there occured soft tissue calcification, mediacalcinosis of the small and medium-sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis. The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but challenging agents like corticosteroids or immunsuppressants, in a sensitized organism (at hypercalcemia or elevated parathormon) could lead to calcium deposits. These are showing a particular affinity for elastic tissue. Lungs, stomach, kidneys, cutis, heart and vascular system are most frequently involved. Treatment is primarily supportive; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis.
