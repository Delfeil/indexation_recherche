Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is a rare disorder of the mitochondrial -oxidation pathway. A female infant at 2,5 months of age presented with coma, cardiorespiratory arrest, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Urinary dicarboxylic acid profile suggested VLCADD. This diagnosis was confirmed by reduced enzyme activity in fibroblasts (20% of controls). After a few days the infant died of peritonitis caused by a penetrating ulcer of the duodenum.
