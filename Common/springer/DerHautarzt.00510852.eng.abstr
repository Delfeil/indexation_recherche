In patients with painful, possibly hemorrhagic vesicles or black crusts, especially on hands/fingers or face/neck with typical history (contact to cows or feral/cats) the possibility of a cowpox/catpox infection has to be considered. The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with the electron microscopy; cytoplasmic inclusions may be detected histologically. Further useful diagnostic tools are the identification of the cowpox/catpox virus by PCR or in cell culture as well as serological tests to detect virus specific antibodies. We report the development of typical skin lesions of a cowpox/catpox infection in two female patients who had contact with cows or cats. Recent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are also discussed.
