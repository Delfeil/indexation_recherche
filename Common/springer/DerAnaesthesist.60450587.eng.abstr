Immediate-type hypersensitivity due to natural rubber (latex) products is an increasing problem for the anaesthetist, because a major part of products used for anaesthesia contains natural rubber. If the patient has a positive history of allergic symptoms after contact to natural rubber like urticaria, bronchospasm or anaphylaxis, preoperative skin tests, in vitro-tests, and if necessary even latex-glove wearing-test should be performed. If preoperative diagnosis of natural latex allergy is established, latex free anaesthesia is strictly recommended, otherwise life-threatening complications may ensue. Accordingly, we report on a patient who developed intraoperative anaphylactic shock following exposure to natural latex. In addition to the treatment with drugs, latex-containing products should be immediately replaced by latex free ones, in particular all persons should put on latexfree gloves. For prevention of anaphylactic episodes in sensitized patients the reader is provided an examplary list of latexfree products for anaesthesia. Because the incidence of immediate-type reactions to latex is still increasing, intraoperative occurence of an anaphylactic reaction to an unknown agent is likely to be due to allergy to natural rubber.
