We report on a 50-year-old man who presented with squamous cell carcinoma of the forehead skin developing from epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). EV is an uncommon disease characterized by flat warts or scaling macules resembling pityriasis vericolor on sun-exposed skin. Histogenetic predisposition and human papilloma virus infection play a part. As shown in our case there is, depending on HPV subtype and additional exposure to ultraviolet light, a high risk of malignant transformation. These patients require close monitoring.
