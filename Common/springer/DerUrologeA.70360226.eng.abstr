Almost 75 % of all urinary calculi can be treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). In contrast to endoscopic and open-surgical procedures the patients are not immediately free of stones. The residual fragments after ESWL are called clinically insignificant residual fragments (CIRF), if the fragments are less than 5 mm in size and if there is the possibility of a spontaneous passage. But CIRF can cause ureteral obstruction. In addition, CIRF play an important role for the risk of stone growth and stone recurrence.
