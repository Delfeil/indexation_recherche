 Complete atrioventricular block (AVB) is a rare dysrhythmia in childhood, the etiology of which can be attributed to a number of causes. The aim of this study was to monitor the different causes, the clinical courses, and the indications for pacemaker therapy. Methods: In a retrospective analysis case histories, ECGs and Holter-ECGs from 71 patients with permanent AVB were reviewed. In addition, in selected cases cardiac catheterization and exercise testing were performed. Results: 37% had a congenital, and 48% an acquired AVB; in 15% of the cases the age of onset could not be determined. Among the neonates 31% each could be attributed to a congenital heart defect (CHD) or a maternal collagenosis; in 38% the reason could not be determined. The acquired AVB was most commonly the result of cardiac surgery. Other reasons were CHD without surgery (18%), myocarditis (15%), heart catheterization (6%) or cardiomyopathy (3%). 48% of patients required the implantation of a pacemaker (PM). The frequency of this operation depended on the cause of the AVB. It was, for instance, 100% in patients after cardiac surgery and 46% in patients with congenital AVB. Six patients had a long QTc interval, not one a malignant ventricular dysrhythmia. However, in the Holter-ECGs and during exercise testing, approximately 30% of the patients had ventricular extra beats. On the whole, the mortality was 19%; notably, these were all patients with CHD. Conclusion: The majority of pediatric AVB is either congenital or a complication of cardiac surgery. The necessity of PM implantation depends on the etiology of the AVB. Relevant ventricular dysrhythmias are rare in childhood; however, the physical capacity of the patients in the absence of CHD remains slightly reduced. The mid-term prognosis of patients with AVB without structural heart disease is good.
