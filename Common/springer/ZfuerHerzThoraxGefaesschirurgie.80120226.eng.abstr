  A retrospective study was performed to investigate the objective and subjective results of the surgical treatment of pectus excavatum and carinatum. We carried out a modified procedure first described by M. Ravitch. The operation starts with the subperichondral resection of the rib cartilage which forms the pectus excavatum or carinatum. The fixation of the sternum is achieved by means of allogenic bone graft.
