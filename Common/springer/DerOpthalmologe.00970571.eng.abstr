Applanation tonometry, following Goldmann's hypothesis serves as the gold Standard in tonometry. However, even this approach principle does not always eliminate examiner's error, especially in defining the applanation surface. An automatic surface and force control system is used to increase measurement precision, thus increasing precision and speed of measurement. The instrument, already in use for the patient's self-tonometry, is now also available for the ophthalmologist. An additional coaxial observation system allows precise centering of the applanation surface onto the cornea. This allows new applications of applanation tonometry in daily routine.
