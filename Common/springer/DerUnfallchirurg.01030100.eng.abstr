Wound healing problems are caused by traumatic influence, due to iatrogenic effects as well as special circumstances of the patient and a combination of all these. The special difficulties of disturbed wound healing in trauma surgery are the possible involvement of the fractured bone and the danger of osteitis. Acute wound healing problems like infected hematoma, necrosis of the wound margins or dehiscense require early or emergency revision surgery with debridement and necrectomy. The sanitation of soft tissue problems encloses secondary sutures, meshgraft as well as local or free flaps. The goal of treatment in wound healing problems must be the avoidance of acute or chronic osteitis.
