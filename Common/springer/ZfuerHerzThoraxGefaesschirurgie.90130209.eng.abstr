 Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the most important side-effect of heparin therapy. Two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin: a frequent non-immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and, on the other hand, an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications.  Patients and methods: We report on two cases with HIT type II after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). HIT antibodies were demonstrated by ELISA for platelet-factor-4-heparin-complex and heparin-induced platelet-activation (HIPA) assay.  Results: A 67 year old patient suffered from a HIT type II seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization. In this patient, a continuous fever and a signicantly reduced general condition were the primary symptoms. The clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy. Thromboembolic complications did not occur. A 70 year old patient developed a HIT type II with thromboembolic complications 13 days after CABG. The vascular occlusions affected the A. spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior-syndrome, the coronary arteries with the development of myocadial infarction, and the A. iliaca interna. A white-clot syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta, in the left atrium, and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation.  Conclusion: With therapy with heparin, it is obligatory to check platelet count. An indication for the development of HIT type II is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy. In the case of HIT type II recombinant hirudin was a practical altenative as an anticoagulant for extracorporal circulation and for continous hemofiltration.
