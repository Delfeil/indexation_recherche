The presentation of the MADIT trial has raised expectations that extended use of fully sequential designs may reduce the duration of clinical trials substantially. On the other hand, AVID and CABG-Patch used group sequential designs that did not reduce trial duration to the same extent.  Are sequential designs useful? Which criteria should be applied for the choice of design?  Comparison of the biometrical characteristics of the designs.  Fully sequential triangular plans reduce study durations to the maximal extent. The prices to be paid are high-standard logistics, difficulties in quality management and reduced lucidity of the presentations.  Fully sequential designs should only be used for the efficacy proof of a striking new therapy if a precise estimate of the amount of benefit is not required. If, on the other hand, the focus is on clinical background, validation or positioning of the new therapy or indication, fixed sample size or moderate group sequential plans are to be preferred.
