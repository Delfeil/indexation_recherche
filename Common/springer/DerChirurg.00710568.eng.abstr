Abstract.  Iatrogenic colonic perforation is a rare but very dangerous complication of colonoscopy. We report on eleven prospectivly recorded patients treated between 1994 and 1998. In seven cases the colonoscopy had been done for diagnostic and in four cases for therapeutic reason. Nine women and two men (age range 56 to 92 years) were affected. In 77 % the perforation was found in the sigmoid colon. All patients were operated on and five sutures, five resections and one colostomy were performed. No significant differences could be shown in six patients with classical perforation compared with five patients presenting with prolonged abdominal pain. Only duration of symptoms was significantly different in the two groups. Three patients (85, 90 and 92 years) died from late complications.
