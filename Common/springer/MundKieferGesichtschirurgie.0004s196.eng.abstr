Within this chapter, tumors which produce bone matrix (osteoid) or other bone-forming tissues, like cartilage, connective tissue, and cementum or originate within the bone marrow are described. In addition, those lesions are mentioned which, according to the WHO, are typical for the jawbones and are therefore included within the 1992 WHO classification of odontogenic tumors. Vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described. All the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance. A precise diagnosis, therefore, can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field. In addition to clinical, radiological, and histological appearances, therapeutic necessities are described. The data from recent publications are taken into account. This presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the German-Austrian-Swiss Study Group of Tumors of the Face and Jaws (DÖSAK) in Basel.
