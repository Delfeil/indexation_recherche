Abstract.  In Western Germany there are at least 2000 self-help groups concerned with dermatological conditions. Besides therapeutic functions, self-help groups deal with prophylaxis and public relations. Interaction between self-help groups and doctors is biased by expectations of support on the self-help groups' side and fears and prejudices on the doctors' side. Thus, for the benefit of their own patients doctors should be well informed about self-help groups working in their region, as the quality of help received from these groups varies widely. In this paper we have listed superregional contact addresses of self-help groups.
