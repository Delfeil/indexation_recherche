The concept of a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become important for psychiatric diagnosis and research, particularly following US-american studies on Vietnam war veterans. Recently, studies on traindrivers involved in suicide accidents have shown symptoms of anxiety and depression in more than 30% of concerned drivers and typical symptoms of a PTSD in 15%. Here, we present the case of a traindriver who was involved in 6 suicide accidents within 17 years of traindriving (the average is 2 suicide accidents). Following the 3rd accident, the driver developed increasingly symptoms like anxiety, sleep disturbances, flashbacks and irritability. Following the 6th accident, he has been unable to work. A former expert opinion saw no relationship between the symptoms of the driver and the suicide accidents. Therefore, further information about the concept of a PTSD seems necessary to ensure early psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment of patients with such a disorder.
