A form of non-verbal psychotherapy, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments: monochord, gong, drum, is presented here. They change the state of consciousness of the patient and help to achieve a multimedial therapeutic flow which is particularly important for extremely disturbed patients, who can not be reached sufficiently by words only. The instruments do not lead to euphoria, they arouse deep pain as well, at the same time they set inner resources free. They facilitate a psychic state very close to body reactions as a possible preparation for body work or a combination of verbal and body therapy. Perinatal, transpersonal and death experiences are within their natural scope.
