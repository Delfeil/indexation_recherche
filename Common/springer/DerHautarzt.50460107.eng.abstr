 We report on a 63-year-old female patient with Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS). In the course of this disease two carcinomas of the colon, a kerato-acanthoma and multiple sebaceous gland tumours, including four sebaceous gland tumours, including four sebaceous carcinomas, appeared. This case is thought to be a heriditary form as one of daughters was also found to have a sebaceous epithelioma. MTS is a mostly autosomal-dominant disease with the association of sebaceous gland tumours and internal carcinomas. As the malignant tumours only show slight aggressiveness the prognosis is quite favourable. Oral isotretinoin therapy was successfully used for the inhibition of sebaceous gland proliferation. A narrower definition is presented and an updated survey of the published cases is given. Furthermore, the histopathologic peculiarities of sebaceous gland tumours, especially of sebaceous gland carcinomas, are discussed and compared to sebaceous gland tumours not connected with MTS. A total number of 100 of the 135 published cases of MTS were included and analysed regarding sebaceous gland tumours and other skin tumours. The data on internal carcinomas were taken from the work of Cohen et al. (1991) and 11 current cases were added.
