Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of potentially reversible dementia. The present case demonstrates a relatively rapid remission of cognitive and noncognitive symptoms within a period of a few months. For separating dementia in hypothyroidism from dementia with hypothyroidism, cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of the clinical features is crucial. Various case studies in the literature have shown the reversibility of dementia in hypothyroidism and therefore indicate that the evaluation of thyroid laboratory parameters is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of dementia and observation of its course.
