 92 patients (11 f) with severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome were treated symptomatically in an open, randomized study with i.v. Clonidine (n=48; 46 y; mean dose 2.3 +/- 1.4 mg/d) or i.v. Clomethiazole (n=48; 43 y; mean dose 5.2 +/- 2.5 g/d). The severity of alcohol withdrawal was estimated by an max 25 point score system. Patients treated with Clonidine reached 13 (10-21), those treated with Clomethiazole 14.5 (10-23) points at inclusion. Normalization of clinical symptoms (score <=5) within 5 days was observed in 84% of patients treated with Clonidine and in 60% patients treated with Clomethiazole (p=0.054). There were 9.3% non-responders with Clonidine and 14.6% non-responders with Clomethiazole. There was no difference in necessity of parenteral nutrition at day 5 of therapy between both groups: 46.5% patients on Clonidine and 43.8% patients on Clomethiazole had enteral nutrition. We found respiratory complications (especially necessity of assisted ventilation) in 19% of patients on Clonidine, but in 44% patients on Clomethiazole on day 4 of therapy. Sedative concomitant medication was necessary in 84% of the Clonidine and 50% of the Clomethiazole patients. Overall tolerability of Clonidine was jedged as better compared to Clomethiazole, yet 6 severe adverse events were observed with Clonidine and only 2 with Clomethiazole. In conclusion therapy of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome is possible with both compounds, Clonidine if combined with sedatives and Clomethiazole. Monotherapy with Clomethiazole was insufficient in about a half, Clonidine in 4/5 of the treated patients. Benzodiazepines are suitable for coadministration with Clonidine; in combination with Clomethiazole they may prolong the duration of alcohol withdrawal. Inspite of lower administration of sedatives with Clomethiazole assisted ventilation and the necessity for tracheal aspiration was needed by more patients compared to Clonidine.
