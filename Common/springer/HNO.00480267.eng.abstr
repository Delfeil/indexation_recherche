The surgical management of enlarged inferior turbinates has been actively debated for more than a century. The second part of this review decribes the following techniques: laterofracture, submucous turbinectomy, concho-antropexy, partial turbinectomy, anterior turbinectomy, inferior turbinoplasty, total turbinectomy, and vidian neurectomy. Indications, advantages, disadvantages, complications, and controversies of each treatment modalitiy are reviewed and discussed. Partial or submucosal resection should be prefered, because there are moderate side effects and the amount of turbinate excised can be altered according the degree of symptomatology. Total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed.
