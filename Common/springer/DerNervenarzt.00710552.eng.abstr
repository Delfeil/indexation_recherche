A sample of 507 social work students completed the Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE). Simulating diagnoses according to DSM-IV criteria, we found three women suffering from bulimia nervosa (BN). This represents a total prevalence of 0.6%, 0.8% in women, and 0.9% in female probands up to the age of 30 years. In the same way, we identified one case of anorexia nervosa (AN), i. e. a total prevalence of 0.2%, 0,3% in women, and 0.3% in female probands up to the age of 30. Nineteen students also fulfilled DSM-IV research criteria for binge-eating disorder (BED), showing a total prevalence of 3.7%, 3.8% in women, 3.5% in men, and 4.3% in female probands up to the age of 30. Thus, BED is the most common eating disorder and also occurs in men. In light of the association between weight discontent and eating disorders, suggestions are made for the management of overweight patients and both normal and underweight clients with eating disorders.
