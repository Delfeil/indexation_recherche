Few patients with prostate cancer metastatic to the lymphnodes can be cured by radiotherapy, radical prostataectomy or androgen deprivation. Inevitably serum PSA levels will rise after a few years whereas the clinical recurrence appears after 5 to 10 years. Prospective trials regarding adjuvant treatment of lymphnode positive prostate cancer do not exist. Retrospective studies involving adjuvant endocrine treatment reveal a prolonged disease free survival time. Scientific proof of the best treatment for prostate cancer with lymphnode metastasis does not exist. The decision how to treat is based on our personal experience and philosophy as well as on our knowledge and interpretation of the available lierature. The art of medicine is the feeling for the best treatment of each individual patient.
