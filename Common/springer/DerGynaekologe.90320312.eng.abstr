Approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence. The treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence, the type of primary therapy administered and the patient's general condition. The limit conditions for the application of the established forms of therapy available - surgical operation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy - are complex and seldom documented by randomized studies. In general, empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned. The main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences.
