Disseminated Langerhans-cell-histiocytosis (LCH) is most frequent in children at the age of 1-3 years, seldomly seen in adults and extremely rare in the elderly. The clinical course may be acute, subacute or chronic, progressive or stationary. Spontaneous remissions are possible, but rare. In elderly patients often the disease is at first limited to the skin before it becomes systemic.
