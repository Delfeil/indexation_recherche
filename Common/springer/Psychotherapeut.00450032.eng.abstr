Abstract  Addictions cannot necessarily be attributed to structural (early) personality disorders, even if early mechanisms are clinically observable. The pathogenesis of addiction needs to be seen in a broader context. Most important is feeling good (e.g., relaxation) after the consumption of alcohol or drugs. If one feels bad, its use is declining. Essential too are (a) the widespread attitudes towards abuse as socially accepted "legitimate" rituals of consumption (e.g., drinking customs), (b) individuals drifting into a subculture, and (c) easy access to alcohol and drugs. If ecstatic states are produced through frequent consumption, regressive personality changes can occur. For example, if an addict can abstain, the prognosis is generally better than similarly structured borderline patients. To conclude that addiction is a "premorbid personality," as is often done in the psychoanalytic literature, appears rash to us. It is only true that persons with early disorders are prone to all sorts of psychic desease, including addiction.
