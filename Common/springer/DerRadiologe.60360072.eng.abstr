Computer-aided diagnosis schemes in mammography aim at improving the mammographic detection of breast cancer. Through special computer algorithms, it is possible to automatically detect suspicious areas in mammographic images. Typical examples are schemes for automatic detection of microcalcifications and masses in mammography. The computer results may be presented to the reporting radiologist, with the computer acting as a diagnostic aid. Various computer-aided diagnosis schemes in mammography are introduced and possible clinical applications are discussed.
