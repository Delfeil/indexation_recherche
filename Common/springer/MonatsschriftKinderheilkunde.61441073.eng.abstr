 Craniometaphyseal Dysplasia (CMD) is a rare congenital osteochondrodysplasia characterized by hyperostosis and sclerosis of the skull and widening of the metaphyseal region of the long bones with clinical manifestation in early childhood. We report on an 18 months old boy with macrocephaly, nasal obstruction and a dysmorphic face (hypertelorism, broad bony overgrowth of the root of the nose, dental irregularities), who's mother had similar but milder stigmata. Radiologic findings of skull and femora of both mother and child allowed the diagnosis. Our investigations of bone metabolism point to an overactivity of osteoblasts. Cranial nerve compression as a typical complication of CMD could be excluded. The nasal obstruction led to a surgical resection of the posterior vomer. Knowledge about this condition allows early diagnosis and therapy of complications.
