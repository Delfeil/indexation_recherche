Hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently. In this paper, under the premise, that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right, the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method. It is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient. First, a series of diagnostic, structural, motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed. Second, the moments of a capacity for cohesion and aspects of social relatedness are considered as helpful tools for a formulation of an indication. As cohesion - according to group treatment outcome research results - has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance, in the context of group psychotherapy, the quest for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions. The conclusion is that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, would preferably be indicated for those patients who suffer from constraints of emotional competence as stemming from developmental deficits.
