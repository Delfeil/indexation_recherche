Cervical lymphadenopathies are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology. There are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists. To gain further information it is advisable to perform sonographically controlled fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNP). If there is no reliable result, it is necessary to remove a lymph node. We report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis X in lymph nodes. A 63-year-old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about 6 weeks previously. The preliminary examinations (FNP/blood examinations) revealed no pathological findings. Only the histological examination delivered the diagnosis of histiocytosis X. Systemic manifestation was excluded by staging examinations. No further therapy was necessary after lymph node extirpation. The report demonstrates how to diagnose and treat this rare disease.
