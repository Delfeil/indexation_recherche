 The non-contact mapping device (Ensite, Endocardial Solution) enables a simultaneous, spatial detection of the myocardial depolarization. An isopotential map is visualized in the 3D reconstruction of the cardiac chamber. The analysis of focal premature beats, of unstable arrhythmias and of macro reentry mechanisms is possible The current article demonstrates the use of the non-contact mapping device for analysis and ablation of atrial flutter, premature beat associated atrial fibrillation and of ventricular tachycardias.
