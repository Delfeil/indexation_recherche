 Bacterial infections are still a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and increased hospital costs, particularly in intensive care units. Antibiotic therapy in intensive care units is usually empirical, with the best suitable antibiotics chosen based on their properties, previous experience, local antibiograms, and familiarity, until the specific infecting pathogen has been identified and the antimicrobial susceptibility is known. Most institutions continue to employ a combination of a -lactam and an aminoglycoside for the empirical therapy, but therapy with a single agent like Ceftazidim, Carbapenem, Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Ciprofloxacin appears to be equally effective in many situations. Deescalating treatment sequentially from an initial combination treatment until the specific infecting pathogen has been identified and the antimicrobial susceptibility is known to a second phase with a tailored therapy for the individual patient is discussed in this paper. Infections caused by both common and rare bacteria can be treated successfully in the vast majority of cases. Nevertheless, multidrug-resis-tant pathogens in intensive care units have shown alarming increases in many countries. Multi-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Staphylococci and Enterococci may be selected by increasing antibiotic pressure. Strategies to stabilize and contain antibiotic resistance in local areas can succeed in prolonging the useful life of antibiotics. Preventing transmission of infection now needs to be coupled with improved antibiotic use.
