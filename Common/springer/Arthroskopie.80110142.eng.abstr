Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVS) occurs in a localized and a diffuse form. Most authors agree that local excision is the appropriate treatment for localized PVS due to low recurrence rates. The appropriate therapy for the diffuse form is still controversial because of the high recurrence rates. For these cases we recommend a differentiated therapy plan with an arthroscopic synovectomy followed by synovial irradiation with yttrium-90 and arthroscopic follow-up in order to recognize a recurrence at an early stage and, hence, to prevent further joint destruction.
