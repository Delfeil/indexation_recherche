  The Brugada-Brugada syndrome is a rhythmologic disorder which can be diagnosed because of typical ECG criteria. A high-take off descending ST segment localized to the right chest leads, associated with right bundle branch block and ventricular fibrillation or syncopes are characteristic of the syndrome. ECG alterations in the right precordial leads were recorded in a 47 year old female patient who was admitted to hospital because of enteritis and associated syncope. The ECG alterations were initally not realized as Brugada-Brugada syndrome. Because of "recognizing" comparable ECG alterations during a congress lecture, the diagnosis was made. The patient was treated with an ICD.
