This study is on the personality of alcoholics, an empirical investigation based on Cloninger's biopsychological temperament- and character-traits. His Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) was applied to 94 detoxified men suffering from primary alcohol dependence as well as to controls matched for sex and sociodemographic data. The following questions were the matter of interest: (1) Do alcoholics and controls differ in their personality as reflected by the TCI and (2) are there indicators based on personality with potential relevance for differential therapies?
