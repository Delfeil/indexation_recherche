Inhibin B, a dimeric glycoprotein, is formed in the Sertoli cells, which interact closely with the gonadal cells. Serum inhibin B concentrations are negatively correlated with the serum FSH concentrations and positively with sperm concentrations, testicular biopsy scores and testicular volumes. Inhibin B is the best known endocrine marker for spermatogenesis. This opens new perspectives for the diagnosis of fertility disturbances and especially for treatment modalities for male infertility.
