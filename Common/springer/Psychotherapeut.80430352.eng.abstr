The basic idea of the Collaborative Family Health Care is nothing new. It has its roots in the bio-psycho-social model of medicine developed by George Engel in the U.S.A. and it has a long tradition in the German psychosomatic medicine. At a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note, that Collaborative Family Health Care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action-orientation. The basic is a systemic view of illness and health. The doctor-patient-dyad is in this view enlarged to a treatment-triad composed of the therapist, the patient and his family, to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal, i.e. the treatment motivation of the patient, the support of the family and the expertize of the therapist. A lot of studies support the resource- saving potential of coopertive methods. However, their realization is not possible without considerable learning processes of physicians, psychotherapists and other  professionals. A potential has to be mobilized, which affects by no means only the costs. The Collaborative Family Health Care offers new challenges to the professional culture of psychotherapists and new chances for influencing the world of medical health care. At a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity, the iniitiatives of CFHC offer a possibility for physicians, patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation. Interested colleagues are invited to collaborate in the German Section of the CFHC.
