 Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare surgical treatment of extracranial carotid aneurysms with endovascular treatment using stents and coils or stentgrafts. Methods: In a retrospective study the data from 19 patients with 22 extracranial carotid aneurysms between 1987 and 1999 were analyzed. Annual clinical follow-up using duplex sonography and in some cases angiographic control was done. Results: Fourteen aneurysms were reconstructed surgically, endovascular treatment was performed in eight cases. A temporary lesion of cranial nerves occurred in 26.6%, a permanent lesion in 6.6% of the surgically treated group. No neurological deficits were apparent. In the patient group which underwent endovascular treatment, 12.5% had a cerebral neurological deficit. In one case the treatment of a stenosis was necessary after 14 months. Conclusions: Surgical reconstruction of extracranial carotid aneurysms is the method of choice. Endovascular treatment should be considered when aneurysms are inoperable or located high at the cranial base.
