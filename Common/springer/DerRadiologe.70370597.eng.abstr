Introduction: The combination of direct magnification mammography and computed radiography provides an improvement in spatial resolution of storage phosphor-based digital systems. A clinical study comparing conventional and digital direct magnification mammograms was performed. Methods: 100 survey mammograms in 1.5- or 1.7-fold magnification and 50 4-fold spot magnification views were obtained with a prototype direct magnification mammography system and a storage phosphor-based digital system. An intraindividual comparison of these with previous conventional radiograms of the same patients was carried out.  Results: The diagnostic value of digital survey mammograms using the direct magnification technique is comparable to that of conventional radiograms of the breast, especially with regard to the identification of microcalcifications and lesions and the clinical consequences. Spot magnification views performed with this combination of techniques allowed improvement in the evaluation of microcalcifications. In 15 % of cases, diagnostic procedures were adjusted accordingly.  Conclusion: The combination of the direct magnification technique with digital storage phosphor radiography systems allows the performance of digital mammography by improving the overall spatial resolution. The diagnostic value of digital direct magnification survey mammograms was comparable to that of conventional mammograms. Digital 4-fold spot magnification views improved visualisation of the morphologic aspects of microcalcifications.
