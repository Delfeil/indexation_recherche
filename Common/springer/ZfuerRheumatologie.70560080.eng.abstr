 Using "paper patients" we compared the therapeutic approaches of general practitioners and rheumatologists to rheumatoid arthritis and to osteoarthritis of the knee. The mailed survey contained a mild, a moderate and a severe case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a case of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. 111 out of 252 general practitioners and 78 out of 132 rheumatologists selected at random participated in the study.
