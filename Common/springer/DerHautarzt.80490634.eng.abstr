During the last decade an unusual amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis has been described in association with autoimmune disease in sixteen female patients. The clinical hallmark is a sterile pustular dermatosis preferentially located in intertriginous regions that responds to local or systemic corticosteroids. Histologic features are subcorneal sometimes spongiform neutrophilic pustules. We report an additional patient suffering from this unusual dermatosis. An overview of the patients described to date and a review of the literature are given in an attempt to delineate this amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis from the known pustular dermatoses.
