 During 1985 and 1993, 7,410 persons were injured in traffic accidents in the area of Hanover. Of these, 306 (4.1%) sustained a pelvic girdle injury. In 139 cases (45%), the pelvic girdle injuries were further classified (Pennal and Tile) and a technical reconstruction of the accident situation was performed. 52% were type A, 27% type B and 21% type C injuries. Some 47% of the casualties were vehicle occupants, 31% pedestrians, 12% motorcyclists and 10% cyclists. In restrained vehicle occupants pelvic girdle injuries occurred mostly in accidents with a delta-v of more than 30 km/h, whereas in unrestrained vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists they also occurred with lower delta-v or collision speed. The percentage of type B and C injuries increased with higher velocities. In addition to further improvements in passive safety, lower collision speed or delta-v is necessary to reduce or prevent pelvic girdle injuries. The reconstruction of pelvic girdle injury mechanism in traffic accidents is possible, when both technical and medical parameters are considered.
