Abstract.  Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technic based on the idea of biological tissue healing. External gene segments are transferred to cells that overexpress growth factors locally to achieve this effect. The influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature. Experimental data demonstrate that defect healing in bone can be accelerated by the application of different cytokines in vivo. Gene transfer is a promising, new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade.
