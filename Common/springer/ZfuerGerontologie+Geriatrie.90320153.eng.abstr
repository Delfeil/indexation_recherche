  Behavioral disorders in dementia are common and are the most important symptoms with regard to socio-economic burden. Up to now there is no common international agreement of how to define and measure these disorders. Antidementia trials focus mainly on cognition. Investigations of neurobiological corrolaries of disturbed behavior in the dementias are rare. The same holds true for studies on the longitudinal course of behavioral disorders and their interrelation. Many symptoms may be the expression of variable conditions, e.g., agitation may be related to anxiety or akathisia. In primary care, hospitals and nursing homes, antipsychotics are most often chosen for their treatment. The available data demonstrate at least a modest efficacy. New neuroleptics (risperidone, clozapine, olanzapine) offer some advantages with regard to the risk benefit ratio. Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed, but seem to be superior to neuroleptics only for the treatment of sleep disorders.
