 A 67 year old male was admitted to our hospital due to subacute anterior myocardial infarction with development of a ventricular thrombus. After fibrinolytic therapy with Streptokinase, he underwent PTCA/Stent-Implantation. From the beginning Heparin was administered intravenously (25 000 IU daily). After development of thromboembolism of the right leg on the 10th day, a thrombectomy was performed with primarily good results. The next day angiography showed multiple embolisms in the right lower leg. Fibrinolytic therapy with Urokinase showed no results nor did intraarterial administration of Prostavasin. Regarding a thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 41 000/µl on day 11, the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II was considered. Heparin induced platelet activation (HIPA) test showed the evidence of a heparin-dependent antibody. After elimination of heparin, the therapy was performed with the low-molecular-weight-heparinoid Org 10172 although factor Xa activity could not be controlled. Subsequently, Phenprocoumon was administered. Thereafter, platelet count raised to normal levels. The clinical image improved quickly, although complete restitution could not be achieved.
