 The coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta. The coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body. The indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart. The resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end-to-end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a recoarctation. After a Vosschulte-aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen. This method, however, brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm. In the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm 22 years after a Vosschulte-aortoplasty.
