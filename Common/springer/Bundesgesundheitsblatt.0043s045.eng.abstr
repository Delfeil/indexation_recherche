In June 1998 the German and Austrian AIDS Clinical Societies issued guidelines on HIV Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP). They provided a standard for consultation and treatment process, including advice on how to proceed in cases of non-nosocomial exposure to HIV. The guidelines were published in scientific and community media.  This study aims to asses the impact of national guidelines on demand for and practice of non-nosocomial Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (NN-PEP) in Germany.  Specialised HIV-practitioners (n=80), clinics (n=100) and health services including AIDS service organizations (n=170) were evaluated regarding demand for and practice of NN-PEP in their institutions during the previous twelve month period. This analysis is based on 100 structured questionnaires. In addition 29 clinical emergency departments and 10 ambulatory emergency services were contacted.  They were asked to provide consultation to a man with risk factors that compose an indication for treatment under the current guidelines.  One year after establishment of a coherent guideline for NN-PEP in Germany, consultation and treatment practices are well established.  68 institutions provided consultation in 531 cases and a treatment recommendation was given in 143 cases. 75 men and 14 women were treated. Ten of them reported needle-sharing as their exposure risk (8 men/2 women).In 90.2% treatment was administered within 24 hours of the risk event.Treatment consists of triple-combination therapy (ten different standards in 40 institutions).Viral load measurements (PCR, bDNA) are used to assess viral replication.  There are different levels of qualification and accessibility, reflecting a specialisation of services. Consultation and treatment are heavily clustered (e.g. two institutions account for 55.2% of all treatment cases).  The cost of treatment is 1500,- til 2800,- DM (750-1400 Euro) per case. Specialisation is also found in the qualitative analysis of the interviews.  Out of 33 telephone contacts 8 yield a consultation in line with current guidelines.The interviews reveal high barriers to NN-PEP during weekend hours (Fri 6 p.m. to Sun 12 p.m.) through ambulatory emergency services.  The demand for consultation and treatment in Germany remains to be low in more than 100 institutions.The specialisation of services provides a basis for data collection and evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of NN-PEP. The process of qualification through guidelines does not appear to have been completed. The different practices of treatment and the low use of treatment in the i.v.  drug-using population need to be further investigated.
