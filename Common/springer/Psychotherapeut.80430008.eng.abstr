Patients' subjective concepts about the appropriate measures to cope with their problems can be conceived as important factors that influence the selection and acceptance of psychotherapeutic treatments. The present study was performed to describe treatment expectations of psychotherapy out-patients presenting at a university department. N=195 patients werde included in the sample. The treatment expectations were assessed by means of a questionnaire that contained 17 items. Factor analysis revealed four dimensions: 1. Interpersonal expectations; 2. insight-oriented expectations; 3. passive expectations; 4. somatic expectations. Insight-oriented expectations scored highest. Interpersonal expectations followed and passive and somatic treatment expectations ranged at the end. Older age was correlated with higher passive and somatic expectations. Both lower levels of education and the diagnosis of a somatoform disorder were associated with somatic treatment demands. The dimensions of treatment expectations were correlated with both locus of control and lay etiology. Therapists rated the quality of therapeutic alliance the higher, the lower passive and somatic treatment expectations were. Cluster analysis revealed four groups of patients: 1. Patients with generally low expectations; 2. patients with overall high expectations; 3. patients with high interpersonal and insight-oriented expectations; 4. patients with high passive and somatic expectations. These attitudes require specific motivational strategies. The results suggest that patients' treatment expectations are core features of their subjective theories of illness. They should be taken into account when selecting appropriate therapeutic measures.
