Defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit. For the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko-ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the primar loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency. The main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko-ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures. With a transpedicular screw-ringband-system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished. After rigid instrumentation with a fixateur intern remained a residual range of motion due to which can result refuse to bending moments without spondylodesis in an implant failure.
