An iatrogenic avulsion of the greater trochanter occurring during prothetic hip replacement after a fracture of the neck of the femur is a rare complication. The need for maximum internal rotation of the limb during the operation imposes serious mechanical stress on the greater trochanter in patients who are often elderly and whose bones are osteoporotic. Two case reports illustrate that a conservative management - without internal fixation - combined with early mobilisation is successful. Our view is based on the current, international opinion that conservative management with early mobilisation is preferable for isolated traumatic avulsion of the greater trochanter, even if there is wide displacement.
