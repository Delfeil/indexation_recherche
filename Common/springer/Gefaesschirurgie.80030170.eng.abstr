 Hemodynamically relevant stenoses of the thoracic and suprarenal aorta in atherosclerotic patients are extremely rare. This entity is different from in-flammatory aortic arch lesions or from infrarenal atherosclerotic stenoses. In a 55-year-old woman suf-fering from hypertension and bilateral arterial occlusive disease, multiple calcified subtotal stenoses of the aorta are diagnosed, suggesting "coral reef atherosclerosis". Based on this example, the thoracoabdominal bypass in a retropancreatic position is compared to a retroperitoneal thoracoabdominal transaortic endarterectomy.
