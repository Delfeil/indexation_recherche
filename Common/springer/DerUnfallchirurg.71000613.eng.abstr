In recent years, our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has greatly expanded. This, in turn, has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain-injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage. The present article focuses on the pathophysiology of TBI and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention. While some of the substances reviewed are presently used in the treatment of TBI, others are under experimental and clinical evaluation at different stages.
