Interactional understanding in psychoanalysis, especially the concept of the 'third point', suggests that the development of insight, empathy and relationship are dimensions of one and the same triangulating process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding. In this context the psychoanalytic method, here understood as working with resistance, transference and countertransference, does not only offer a route to cognition, but also to the formation of a conflict-solving, egostrengthening, and supportive relationship peculiar to psychoanalysis. The formula 'interpretation on the basis of countertransference' describes a form of psychoanalytic interpretation that takes up this context intentionally and can thus also be used for crisis intervention in the case of neurotic conflicts. This is exemplified by a case history.
