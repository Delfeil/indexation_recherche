Color-coded duplex sonography is the main innovation in diagnostic ultrasound in recent years. It allows quantification of tissue vascularity and appreciation of vascular morphology. Due to the unique thyroid hypervascularity in Graves' disease this diagnosis can be made with color Doppler sonography alone. The decrease of vascularity during the course of disease is a relevant parameter throughout the follow-up. Hypervascularity is also observed within areas of inflammatory infiltration in thyroiditis, but the level is lower than in Graves' disease. Sonographic differentiation of benign from malignant thyroid nodules is not possible yet. Color-coded duplex sonography is not useful in the initial detection of parathyroid masses, but may be helpful in distinguishing parathyroid lesions from other cervical masses.
