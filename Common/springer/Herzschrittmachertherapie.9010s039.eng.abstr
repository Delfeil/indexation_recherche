 Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men. It is associated with a two-fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers. The relative inefficacy and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies. Ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two alternate strategies: ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation. It has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus. These ectopic foci can be mapped and ablated, thereby removing the substrate for initiation of atrial fibrillation. Most often, these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins. A challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study. To sidestep the need of mapping, pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions. In patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation, efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation. Strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant wavelets requiring a critical myocardial mass to perpetuate. Several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative compartmentalization of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation. Currently, attempts were made to reproduce the surgical technique using transveneous, catheter-based approaches. Though our knowledge of ablation techniques and technical prerequisites is continuously increasing, the difficulty to produce complete linear lesions in the left atrium and local thrombus formation at the ablation line are problems that are still not solved.
