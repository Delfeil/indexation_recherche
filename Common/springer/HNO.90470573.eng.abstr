Extracranial meningiomas of the head and neck region are very rare, although secondary extracranial meningiomas beside meningiomas of primary extracranial origin have also been described. Trauma, radiation and (uncommonly) metastatic spread have been associated with the pathogenesis of secondary extracranial meningiomas. We present a case of a 53-year-old patient who required six neurosurgical interventions because of a recurrent intracranial meningioma. Further surgery was required for tumor in the left parotid gland. Histological examination of this neoplasm showed an atypical meningotheliomatous meningioma. The patient is now 17 months after surgery and is free of local recurrences or metastases.
