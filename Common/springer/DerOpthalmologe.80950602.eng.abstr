Background: CMV retinitis is the most common opportunistic ocular infection and the main cause of blindness in AIDS patients with a T-helper cell count <= 50/µl. Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half-life time after phosphorylation intracellularly. It is effective against CMV and can be given intravenously and intravitreally. The aim was to offer an alternative therapy for CMV retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it. The efficacy and tolerance of intravitreal injections of cidofovir should be evaluated.
