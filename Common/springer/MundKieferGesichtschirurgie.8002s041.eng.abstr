In 12 patients with craniosynostosis the influence of early fronto-orbital advancement on the growth of the frontal sinus and supraorbital region was examined. A follow-up examination at the age of 8 years showed a lack of pneumatisation of about 50%. However, there was no correlation between this score and the external contour. The frontal sinus has no dominant influence on the growth of the supraorbital region. In 9 out 12 of cases the very early operation time did not lead to disturbances of growth. A further follow-up examination of the patients after termination of growth at the age of 16 is planned.
