In a prospective study, we examined 34 patients with shoulder instabilities and 5 patients with unclear chronic shoulder pain (4 females, 35 males; 18 - 56 years of age, median 28 years) by CT arthrography and MRT arthrography from August 1994 through December 1995. No complications were seen when gadolinium-DPTA was applied intra-articularly. Twenty-three patients were follwed up by operation and/or arthroscopy; 20 patients underwent a modified, open Bankart operation. In this paper, we present a new classification for damage of the anterior capsule and labrum. MRT arthrography showed better results in judging the anterior labrum and in determining the degree of damage to the labrum (sensitivity, specificity and accuracy 100%) in comparison with CT arthrography (sensitivity 90%, specificity 100%, accuracy 91%). Furthermore, MRT arthrography gave clearer results than CT arthrography regarding SLAP and cartilage lesions. Thus, MRT arthrography has proved to be a very exact method for diagnosing shoulder instabilities and is superior to CT arthrography in diagnostic accuracy.
