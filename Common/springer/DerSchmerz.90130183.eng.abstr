In patients with renal or hepatic failure, the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways, leading to the necessity to correct the dose. The liver is the major site for biotransformation of most opioids. The major metabolic pathway is oxidation. Exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine, which undergo primarily glucuronidation, and remifentanil which is cleared by esther hydrolysis. The hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly excreted by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency. Some metabolites such as morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) or normeperidine are active opioid agonists. With high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression. In addition, special risks are known for normepridine that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures. Few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramdol have been reported. The elimination half-life of these drugs was prolonged. Lastly, the disposition of methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure.
