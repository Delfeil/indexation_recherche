Therapeutic interventions in the skeletal system are an essential part of interventional radiology. Although in terms of figures these procedures are applied less frequently, they are very effective. Percutaneous transarterial embolization of a spinal tumor is well-established interventional treatment. It is primary treatment for preoperative devascularization, but also for palliation of pain and for reduction of tumor volume. As an alternative access for embolization, direct percutaneous puncture of a vertebra is used. A new and promising technique is vertebroplasty, the percutaneous injection of acrylic surgical cement in destroyed vertebrae. The present paper discusses indications, technique, results and complications of these interventional therapeutic modalities in the treatment of primary and secondary spinal tumors.
