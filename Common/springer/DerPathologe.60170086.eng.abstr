Periosteal osteosarcoma is a distinct bone tumor entity with characteristic morphological features within the group of juxtacortical osteosarcoma. Periosteal osteosarcoma is predominantly located in the long tubular bones, especially in the tibia and femur and is situated on the outer circumference of the tumor-bearing bone (saucerization phenomenon). In contrast to parosteal osteosarcoma, periosteal osteosarcoma is less differentiated and is believed to have a worse prognosis. In this work the histological features are described with predominantly chondroblastic differentiation of 14 cases with periosteal osteosarcoma. A horizontal preparation technique of periosteal osteosarcoma specimens allows comparison with computed tomography and is the optimal method to detect an invasion of the medullary cavity. Further studies are necessary to clarify if neoadjuvant chemotherapy could improve the prognosis of certain patients.
