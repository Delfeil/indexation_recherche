In this article we report on a 43-year-old man, who had been treated with two cortisone injections containing soja bean oil for epicondylitis humeri radialis. Four weeks after the second injection necrotized fat which had been extracted surgically was sent to us for histological examination. We could show a calcifying collagen fibre necrosis being cleared by a granulomatous reaction and resorbed by granulation tissue. The calcifying necrosis of collagen fibres might have been induced by soja bean oil which were used as carrier of the drug.
