For evaluation of the hormone receptor status in breast cancer tissues two methods are mainly used: immunohistochemical detection by monoclonal antibodies on frozen sections (ER-ICA, PgR-ICA) and the biochemical radioligand-binding assay (DCC) of fresh tissue. Using new antibodies makes it possible to evaluate the estrogen and progesterone receptor status in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. In the present retrospective study, tissues from 223 primary breast carcinomas or breast carcinoma recurrences were reevaluated with the three methods mentioned above and the results were compared. We used antibody 1D5.26 reacting with the estrogen receptor and mPR1 specific for the progesterone receptor in paraffin-embedded tissue. The agreement of positive and negative cases between these two immunohistochemical procedures was 97.8 % for the estrogen receptor and 85.7 % for the progesterone receptor. Comparison of immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue and biochemical evaluation showed an agreement of 74.7 % for the estrogen receptor and 68.7 % for the progesterone receptor. These results are comparable to the correspondence between ER-ICA and PgR-ICA and the DCC method. This study proves that the prognostically and therapeutically important hormone receptors can be reliably determined in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. These results are not only important for the evaluation of hormone receptors of a small breast carcinoma that is not found in the frozen section, but for the considerable difference in costs among the different methods.
