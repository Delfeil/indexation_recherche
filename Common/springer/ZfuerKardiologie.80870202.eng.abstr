  Problem: Atrial fibrillation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The increased risk of thromboembolism makes constant anticoagulation necessary, while the absence of atrial contraction worsens the hemodynamic situation. In this study we examined the results of simultaneous surgical treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation through "Cox/Maze-III-procedure" while mitral valve surgery and atrial septal closure. Patients and methods: Between February 1995 and July 1997 sixteen patients aged 50 to 72 y (mean: 59 y) underwent open heart surgery (mitral valve replacement n = 10, reconstruction n = 3; mitral valve reconstruction and atrial septal closure n = 1, atrial septal closure n = 1, thrombectomy from left atrium n = 1) and "Cox/Maze-III-procedure" in one session. Preoperative duration of chronic atrial fibrillation was between 2 and 12 y (nean: 5.0 y). The patients were examined preoperatively and postoperatively 3, 6, 12, and 24 month after surgery using the following methods: transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), ECG, long-term ECG, and stress ergometry. Results: During the early postoperative period (< 7 d) all of the patients were in sinus rhythm or atrial pacing; eight patients intermittently had atrial fibrillation. In the follow-up period from 1 to 27 months (mean 14 months), 15 patients have a stable sinus rhythm (94%). One patient, preoperatively known to have intermittent tachybradycardia, received a pacemaker 2 months postoperatively for sinus bradycardia. Postoperatively in TEE patients showed left atrial contraction with improvement of hemodynamic situation. Stress ergometry 6 months postoperatively showed lower increasements of heart rate, at 12 months normal frequency. Conclusion: The surgical treatment of chronic atrial fibrillation through "Cox/Maze-III-procedure" can be performed combined with other heart operations without increased perioperative or postoperative risks. The Maze-procedure is an effective surgical therapy of chronic atrial fibrillation. Postoperatively there is an improvement of the hemodynamic situation of sinus rhythm and synchrone atrioventricular contraction.
