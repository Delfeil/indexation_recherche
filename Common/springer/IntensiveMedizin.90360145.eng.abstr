 Despite advancing knowledge of the pathophysiology and treatment of asthma, asthma mortality is not reduced. Patients with severe asthma exacerbations develop progressive airflow obstruction over hours to days as a result of airway wall inflammation, bronchospasm and intraluminal mucus. Airflow obstruction causes ventilation-perfusion inequality, lung hyperinflation, and increased work of breathing. Severe cases are characterized by an inability to speak, diaphoresis, pulsus paradoxus, accessory muscle use, low peak expiratory flow rate, and a rising partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Inhaled beta-agonists, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids, and oxygen remain the drugs of choice in severe asthma exacerbations. Anticholinergics play a lesser role in the treatment of acute asthma. Available data do not support the routine use of ketamine, magnesium sulfate, heliox or antibiotics in patients with severe asthma exacerbations. For now, bronchoscopy with BAL should not be considered a part of the routine management of asthmatics. Patients failing drug therapy should be considered early for noninvasive ventilation or intubation and mechanical ventilation. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation are promising adjuncts to the treatment of nonintubated patients. A strategy of mechanical ventilation including limition of minute ventilation, decreasing inspiratory peak pressure, and tolerating hypercapnia, avoids excessive lung hyperinflation and barotrauma. Indirect evidence suggests that this approach to mechanical ventilation in acute severe asthma decreases morbidity and mortality; however, the key to the management of this disease (which in many cases represents a failure of outpatient management) is patient education and disease prevention.
