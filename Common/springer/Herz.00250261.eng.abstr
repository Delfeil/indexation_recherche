The sera of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and the Chagas' disease contain agonist-like autoantibodies directed against the 1-adrenoceptor and/or the muscarinic M2-receptor. The anti-1-adrenoceptor antibodies could be directed against amino acid sequences of the first or second extracellular loop.
