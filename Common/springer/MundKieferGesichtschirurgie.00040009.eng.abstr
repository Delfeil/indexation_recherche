Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia. Usually, a non-continuous distraction mode is applied. The aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder. Using a submandibular approach, the mandible was dissected subperiostally on one side in four mini-pigs; corticotomy was performed and the microhydraulic cylinder fixed with two bicortical screws. The hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic hydropneumatic injector system. Following 7 days at rest, a continuous distraction of 1.5 mm per day was performed for 14 days. After 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively, the animals were killed and X-rays taken. The mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed. The microhydraulic cylinder was easy to apply and to handle. The continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles. Bony regeneration seems to be accelerated, which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase.
