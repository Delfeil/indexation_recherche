Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans (KFSD) appeared sporadically in an Asian boy, who also presented with naevus teleangiectaticus lateralis, patent ductus arteriosus (Botalli) and hypospadia. The association of these findings raises the question of a new syndrome. In addition, this is the first report of KFSD in a patient of Asian origin.
