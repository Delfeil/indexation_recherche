 Most cases of uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax as well as pneumothoraces caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can be managed by insertion of a small-lumen catheter. In contrast, a large bore chest tube is indicated in complicated pneumothorax. Life-threatening tension pneumothorax has to be diagnosed quickly on clinical grounds and must be decompressed immediately. Hemothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma may cause massive blood loss and should be treated rapidly by chest tube or thoracotomy. Spontaneous hemothorax should also be drained and warrants careful diagnostic evaluation. Any physician in a respiratory or medical intensive care unit should be trained in the management of pneumothorax and hemothorax.
