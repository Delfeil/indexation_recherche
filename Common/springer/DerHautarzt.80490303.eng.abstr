A 56-year-old female patient with generalized granuloma anulare was treated with bath-PUVA therapy with 8-methoxypsoralen. Her diabetes mellitus renal insufficiency excluded oral photochemotherapy. A series of 30 treatments resulted in complete disappearance of the lesions on the trunk and neck and significant improvement of those on the limbs. No side-effects were observed. Bath-PUVA therapy seems to have positive effects not only on epidermal, but also on dermal processes.
