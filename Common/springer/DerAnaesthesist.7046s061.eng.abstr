This review focuses on the significance of S-(+)-ketamine as a neuroprotective agent. Evidence in the literature supporting or contradicting a neuroprotective or even therapeutic role of ketamine in global cerebral ischaemia is critically reviewed, and data from an ongoing study in a rat global cerebral ischaemia model (15 min ischaemia with S(+)-ketamine administered 15 min after reperfusion) are reported. The number of experimental studies available so far limited, however, and therefore results cannot be considered conclusive at the present time. Only at higher ketamine dosages was protection found reliably, especially in models of complete forebrain ischaemia lasting over 10 min. In our own study, only after 90 mg/kg S(+)-ketamine was there significantly better preservation of cortical neurons than without treatment; 30 and 60 mg/kg did not produce this effect.
