Within the context of an extensive study of electroconvulsive therapy at the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Bonn 15 patients suffering from therapy-resistent Major depression (DSM III-R) were examined with a detailed psychometric test battery, containing memory- and nonmemory tests. The test battery had been applied short time before, during and after the treatment with 10 ECT applied unilateral over the nondominant hemisphere. Comparing the test performances before and 1-2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes: a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in 30 min delayed recall of verbal items, while visual short-term memory and visual-constructive performance showed a significant improvement (in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side). None of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was detracted short time after the end of the ECT-treatment, instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly. Between responders to treatment (50% improvement in HAMD) and non-responders no significant differences neither before nor after the treatment were detected. The non-responders had in nearly all of the tests some better (but not significantly) results despite being older than the group of responders.
