 With the German law "Sozialgesetzbuch 5" and its §137 coming into force, hospitals are obliged in taking part in quality assurance programs in Germany. In the last ten years the requirements of quality management are to be defined and implemented by the clinical directors and executives. Controlling in medical affairs was formerly ruled by law as far as technical and laboratory procedures were concerned. Quality assuring measures are aimed to improve structural processes, treatment methods and medical outcomes. Continuing quality improvement is meant to describe the dynamic character that is needed when starting quality assurance programs and planning follow-up measures. This will result in improvement of quality of life for the patients, more efficient clinical structures, costs reduction in the health care system and even in having more time for education of the medical personnel. Besides these modern aspects of physicians' treatment the ancestors had rules for medical measures, too. In the past the ancient cultures developed more and more rules about technical, medical and ethical questions to beware the patient from mistreatment and to avoid adverse events and even to punish the charlatan.
