We investigated the therapeutic effect of marked body weight reduction on the predominantly obstructive sleep apnea syndrome by the application of an out-patient, behaviour therapy based body weight reduction program (Optifast-program) in five of our obese apnea patients (mean overweight by Broca 53,6  +/-  24,8 kg). Mean body weight reduction was 32,7  +/-  15,8 kg after six months. The mean apnea-index of 34,5  +/-  23,1/h prior to the weight reduction dropped to 7,8  +/-  6,1/h after therapy. The mean apnea-hypopnea-index (so called "respiratory disturbance index", RDI) could be reduced from 45,7  +/-  26,0/h to 14,0  +/-  11,4/h. The best therapeutic effect on the sleep related respiratory parameters was seen in patients who reached their normal weight whereas the absolute weight reduction itself seems to be less important. Our results should encourage this causal therapy in appropriate patients.
