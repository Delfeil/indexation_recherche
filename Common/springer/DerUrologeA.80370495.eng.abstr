In diagnostics of erectile dysfunction there are different simple or large-scale procedures available. Refering to a three-step-scheme that makes difference in the diagnostics in I. non-invasive, II. semi-invasive and III. invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained. To the non-invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics, the physical examination and laboratory screenings. The semi-invasive procedures include the intracavernous injection test with vasoactice substances, the doppler sonography and duplex or color duplex sonography, the corpus-cavernosum-electromyogram (CC-EMG) and other neurophysiological examinations. The third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological cavernosography and cavernosometry (DICC) and the selective pharmacological phallo-arteriography. The procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions.
