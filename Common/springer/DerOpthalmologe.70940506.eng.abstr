Background: Several studies have confirmed, that the no-stitch technique results in early stabilization of astigmatism. In these papers, however, the follow-up was quite short. Former studies about sutured corneoscleral incisions have shown that even after some years astigmatism increased. Therefore, in this prospective study we investigated the change of induced astigmatism 5 years postoperatively.
