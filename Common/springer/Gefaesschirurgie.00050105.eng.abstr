Abstract  An aortocaval fistula (ACF) involving the abdominal aorta is an uncommon sequela of spontaneous aneurysmal rupture into the adjacent vena cava. Despite the well-characterized physiologic effects the diagnosis is often delayed or overlooked. In this paper, 15 such cases among our own patients from the the years 1970 to 1997 are reviewed. The interval from presumed occurrence to diagnosis ranged from 3 h to 3 weeks. Just one patient was admitted with a complete and correct diagnosis. Back and/or abdominal pain was present in 13 (87%) patients. A pulsating tumor could be found in 11 cases (73%). The presence of a typical abdominal bruit (67%) was the most reliable physical finding. Signs of a hemorrhagic shock could be seen in all six patients with an acute ACF. In nine patients with a chronic ACF the sequelae of the left-to-right shunt were predominant: CHF (n=7), severe edema of the lower extremities (n=7), and signs of renal insufficiency (n=6). Two patients died before the scheduled operation, one of cardiac arrest and one due to pulmonary emboli). Thirteen patients were treated surgically: 12 survived, one developed pneumonia due to infection with Proteus and died . The diagnosis of ACF is dependent on the recognition of its clinical features. The dramatic picture of a patient with pain, a pulsating abdominal mass, machinaey murmur, signs of a hemorrhagic shock or high output cardiac failure is pathognomonic for an aortocaval fistula. Early diagnosis and immediate operative treatment is the key to successful management of this highly lethal condition.
