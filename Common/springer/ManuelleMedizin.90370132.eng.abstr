The attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system - analogical to electronic data processing systems - as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system. Thereby dysfunctions can be seen as misplaced variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences. This leads to a failure of the corresponding software modul that results in the loss of function which is regulated through this modul. Especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through needling, a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function. With this hypothesis all phenomens of dysfunctions can be explained.
