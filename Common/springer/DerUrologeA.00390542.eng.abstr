Intravesically applied medications have the benefit of establishing high concentrations of a therapeutic agent at the intended target tissue along with a low risk for systemic side effects. Pentosanpolysulfate is frequently applied for this purpose and was shown to significantly reduce nycturia while frequency during the day remained unaffected in a controlled study. Heparin reduced nycturia in an open prospective protocol as well. For heparin the maximal onset of a therapeutic effect is often observed as late as 4-6 months after initiation of treatment. Heparin as well as pentosanpolysulfate cause practically no side effects.
