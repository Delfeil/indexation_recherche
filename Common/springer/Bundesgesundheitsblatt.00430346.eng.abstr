The area "Environment and Health" is characterized by interdisciplinary features and, consequently, an intense need for communication. In addition it has to be considered that sometimes there are difficulties in terms of information search. A comparison of national problem solving strategies concerning electronic network activities within this area led to the development project for a European information and communication platform. By this electronic platform the international exchange of experiences, coordination of activities, harmonization efforts and an optimization of qualification possibilities for environmental health professionals will become easier.
