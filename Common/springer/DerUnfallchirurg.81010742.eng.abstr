Accidental hypothermia (AH) can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below 35  °C during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic thermoregulatory dysfunction. Pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co-morbid factors such as trauma, submersion, intoxication and underlying diseases. In trauma victims stratified according to the Injury Severity Score, the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival. In these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible. In the Utrecht University Hospital, adult patients with AH are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions. Patients with perfusing cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over 80 mmHg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR). Arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In a 3-year period, 22 patients with AH were admitted to the emergency department. Fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia. Twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm (CAVR n = 18, CPB n = 2) and two patients were alternatively managed. Mortality in the CAVR group was 28 % and total mortality reached 32 %. Complications of CAVR are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation. CAVR permits a good access to the (trauma-) patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries.
