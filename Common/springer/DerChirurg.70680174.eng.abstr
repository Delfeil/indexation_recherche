 A total of 113 patients with acute and chronic instability of the ulnar collateral ligament metacarpal phalangeal (MP) joint of the thumb were treated surgically between 1980 and 1985; 82 patients were followed up after a mean period of 10 years. Of 59 patients with acute injuries, 52 were painfree with full stability of the MP joint; 23 patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability. Nevertheless, the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired. The results of follow-up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective.
