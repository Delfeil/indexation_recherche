Lichen ruber planus is considered a T-cell mediated immunologic reaction with unclear pathogenesis. Drugs and infections (especially hepatitis B and C) are well-known provocation factors. After an infection with scabies a 13 year old boy developed a generalized lichen planus including bullous lesions. For the first time scabies is presented as a trigger for lichen planus. In childhood, lichen planus is characterized by atypical clinical features and sometimes a severe course.
