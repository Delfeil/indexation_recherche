In adjuvant therapy of breast cancer, instead of individualized chemotherapy regimens there is a tendency towards more aggressive protocols in patients with high risk of recurrence. In this context even therapy-related mortality is accepted because therapy may be curative. In contrast, chemotherapy for metastatic disease mainly aims at palliation. Reduction of therapy-related side effects is one of the major endpoints of clinical trials in stage IV breast cancer. Routine follow-up procedures that do not aim at early diagnosis of metastatic disease, but at the diagnosis of symptomatic metastases, further reflect this therapeutic strategy. During recent years this paradigm has been challenged by two new developments. On the one hand, new therapies like high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support may allow long-term survival for certain subgroups of patients with metastatic disease. On the other hand, the refinement of diagnostic procedures may allow "metastatic disease" to be detected in breast cancer that, according to TNM staging, is classified as early breast cancer. This and the concept of "micrometastases" that are treated by adjuvant therapy imply that by conventional staging with chest X-ray, liver ultrasound and bone scans somehow artificially two different stages of the same disease are defined. Even if the biology of metastasis or the refinement of diagnostic procedures is of great interest, routine therapeutic strategies must be guided by the results from clinical trials that mainly deal with metastatic breast cancer as defined by conventional staging procedures. Every modification of this definition, even if it reflects more intimate understanding of the disease, must be evaluated in prospective randomized clinical trials.
