 Vascular surgery continues to be one of the few surgical specialties for which there is no accompanying medical specialty. While I recognize the emerging specialty of vascular medicine, its orientation is almost exclusively toward research and its numbers are small. To date, it has had little impact on vascular practice patterns. Thus, the vascular surgeon must be familiar with the broad body of literature which refers to the entire vascular system, and by no means be limited to the technical aspects of surgery alone.
