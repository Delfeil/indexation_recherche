Abstract.  Morphological examination methods which are appropriate for detection of embryonic developmental defects are presented. The main emphasis is put on autopsy of small embryos using a dissection microscope and on documentation of the embryonic skeleton by means of skeleton staining. Through presentation of the embryopathological findings in 15 first-trimester abortion specimens we demonstrate that these examination techniques frequently allow diagnosis of isolated malformations as well as malformation syndromes, even in the fragmented or macerated embryo. Careful embryopathological examination and evaluation is a precondition for genetic counselling, as well as for goal-directed prenatal diagnostic measures in future pregnancies.
