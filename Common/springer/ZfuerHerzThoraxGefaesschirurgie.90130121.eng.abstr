  Twelve non-consecutive patients aged between 5 and 19 years with univentricular heart and hypoplastic pulmonary artery bed, who early in life underwent systemic-to-pulmonary shunt for augmentation of pulmonary artery diameter, and after normalization of pulmonary artery size a Fontan procedure, were enrolled in the study. The inclusion criteria were normal pulmonary vascular resistance, competent atrio-ventricular valve(s), and globally unimpaired ventricular function. All patients were grouped according to the level of the pulmonary artery flow: restrictive QP:Qs<1.0 (n=6), balanced QP:Qs=1.0 (n=3), and excessive Qp:Qs>1.0 (n=3). In each patient, for assessment of the development of the proximal segments of the pulmonary arteries the Nakata-index and McGoon-ratio, and for assessment of the medial and distal segments of the pulmonary artery a selfdeveloped computer assisted planimetric area calculation - index (PPAAI; cm2/m2 b.s.a.) were analyzed in correlation to the level of the pulmonary flow index (Qpi). The cardio-pulmonary situation was assessed by following parameters: Hb, Sasat%, Qp/Qs, PAP, Rp/Rs, EDVP, FS%, and ventricular diastolic compliance (VC=EDVP/Qpi+Qsi). There was a positive correlation between the pulmonary flow index (Qpi) and the Nakata- and McGoon-values suggesting a prognostic relevance of the Qpi in the assessment of the tendency of development of the pulmonary artery diameter. There was no correlation between Qpi and PPAAI, the planimetrically assessed pulmonary vessel areas in patients with restrictive and excessive pulmonary artery flow were comparable. In conclusion, the Nakata-index is due to the shunt related distortion of the proximal segment of the pulmonary artery a non-reliable factor in the assessment of the degree of development of the pulmonary artery tree. The assessment of the medial and distal pulmonary artery segments seems to be more valid and should be considered for optimal timing for definite surgery.
