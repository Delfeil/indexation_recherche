 In situations of depressed myocardial function, the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently. In different pathophysiological situations, such as chronic heart failure, open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation, cardiac transplantation, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and reversible myocardial dysfunction, which may represent a final common pathway. The available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function, i.e., contractility, preload, afterload, and heart rate, by cytokines. Potential mechanisms include the -adrenoceptor- and nitric oxide pathway, as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis. Interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge.
