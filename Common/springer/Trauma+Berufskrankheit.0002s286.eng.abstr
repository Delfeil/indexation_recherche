The high-speed train disaster on 3.6.1998 was the biggest railway accident so far in the history of the German Federal Railway and confronted the emergency services in the region of Celle with ravages of hitherto unknown dimensions. The rescue operation was successfully achieved, in optimal outdoor conditions, through cooperation of the neighbouring rescue services of various organizations, the first aid workers belonging to the voluntary organizations, and the volunteer and full-time firefighters, with further support from the army, the technical relief organization, the police and the border police. Within 3 h, 87 patients, some of them very badly injured, had been brought out and received on-site medical care and were on the way to the hospital for further treatment. The exceptionally rapid gathering of so many rescue and salvage workers (1800 in all!), and in particular the availability of a large number of rescue aircraft (39 craft), meant that de facto no deficiency in care arose at the scene of the accident. It was possible for the accident victims to receive almost individual medical care; there was no need for triage in the usual way, and overloading of the hospitals close by was avoided. Ninety-six bodies were salvaged from the wreckage at the scene of the accident - later 5 severely injured patients died in hospital of their injuries. Communication at the point of action and the preparation of documentation again emerged as the familiar problems they always are at large-scale disaster sites. Technically, salvage from the high-speed railway cars provided to be particularly difficult because there are so few access and penetration points. Particular features of the rescue work were in the coordination between civil and military air rescue facilities - involvement of the sea-air rescue head office and the on-scene coordinator - and the necessary closure of the airspace over the scene of the accident and the nearby military drill squares.
