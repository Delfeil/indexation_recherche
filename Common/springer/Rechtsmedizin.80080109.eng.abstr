 The skull of a small child, which was largely devoid of soft tissue, was classified according to forensic/anthropological findings and could be identified on the basis of DNA typing by PCR using residual brain tissue, but not bone. This case illustrates the fact that careful forensic/anthropological investigation is an important basis for molecular biological identification from skeletal remains and that DNA typing by PCR may even be possible on brain tissue that has been exposed to damp conditions and is an advanced state of decomposition.
