Both dacryocystography and dacryoscintigraphy are well established in the evaluation of stenoses of the lacrimal drainage system. They provide limited information about the ductal anatomy itself and about periductal structures. MR imaging was evaluated for its capability to directly visualize the lacrimal drainage system in detail and simultaneously provide functional characterization of dacryostenosis.
