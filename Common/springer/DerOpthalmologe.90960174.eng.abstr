Purpose: Contraction of the capsule of the ocular lens is based upon proliferation and contraction of transformed lens epithelial cells. It is assumed that these processes can be assisted by postoperative intraocular inflammation. Previously, we reported that lens epithelial cell proliferation is enhanced by lymphocyte-conditioned medium (LCM). In this study we investigated the effect of LCM as well as of a culture medium conditioned by pigmented ciliary epithelial cells (CBCM) on the expression of the smooth-muscle alpha-actin of the contractile cytoskeletal elements.
