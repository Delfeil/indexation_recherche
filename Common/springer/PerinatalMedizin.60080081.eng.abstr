 Persistent pulmonary hypertension is a syndrome which often occurs during severe respiratory failure of the newborn, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. Many of these patients are transferred to specialized centers, requiring extracorporal membrane oxygenation as a life-saving therapy. Since three years several reports on the effectiveness of inhaled NO have been published, promising a new treatment of PPHN. In the present trial we studied the effect of inhaled NO in neonates and preterm infants suffering from severe respiratory failure and consecutive PPHN.
