Obstructions of the nasolacrimal duct occur frequently (70%) in term newborns and are symptomatic in 6%. The reason is an incomplete canalization and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period. A persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of Hasner in combination with a proximal valvelike obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation. We describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress.
