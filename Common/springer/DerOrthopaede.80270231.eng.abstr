Bisphosphonates are a new therapeutic option in the treatment of bone diseases. They inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and are established in the treatment of osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone and especially in tumor bone disease. The effects of pamidronate, clodronate and ibandronate in the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy and osteolytic bone disease have been extensively studied. These drugs represent the treatment of choice in hypercalcemia of malignancy. The regular application of bisphosphonates reduces skeletal-related events like pathologic fracture, bone pain or hypercalcemia of malignancy, especially in breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Of great interest are the ongoing studies concerning prophylactic application of bisphosphonates in tumors bearing a high risk for bone metastases, especially since the first results suggest a significant reduction in the development of bone metastases in breast cancer patients.
