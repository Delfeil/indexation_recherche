Maxillofacial traumas are common and often associated with other injuries. From a forensic point of view, it is often necessary to relate the traumatic event to the subsequent injuries. The aim of this study was to explore the etiology of maxillofacial injuries due to objective signs and the anamnestic history of patients. In a prospective study over a 1-year period, all patients presenting with mandibular and midface fractures seeking treatment at the University Medical Center in Münster, Germany, were investigated. Demographic data, patient history, and pattern and etiology of injury were recorded, along with evaluations of the patients' descriptions. Thorough clinical and radiological investigation was performed and photographic records were taken. In our study, 122 patients, with a male to female ratio of 2 : 1 were included. The mean age was 30.7  +/-  13.4 years. Assault was the most common etiology (40%), followed by traffic accidents (29%) and falls (17%). Alcohol was reported to play a role in 40% of all injuries. There was no difference in the number of patients with mandibular or midface fractures. In 75%, maxillofacial fractures were associated with other injuries. The patients' descriptions of the orofacial traumas seemed to be highly. For age, anatomical location, concomitant injuries, and other signs of trauma, we found no statistical association with the underlying etiology.
