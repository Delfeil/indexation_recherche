Hereditary hypophosphataemic rickets (familial hypophosphataemias) form a group of different diseases. Much progress has been made over the last few years in understanding the pathogenesis of the disorder but good medical care of these patients is still a challenge for paediatric nephrologists or endocrinologists. Because X-linked dominant hypophosphataemic (XLHR) rickets is the commonest form of inherited hypophosphataemias, it will be described in detail. New aspects of pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapeutic approach will be reviewed. The clinical, biochemical and molecular features of other forms of hypophosphatemic rickets will be described.
