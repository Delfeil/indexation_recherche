 In recent years an increasing number of drug fatalities with blood concentrations of lidocaine up to 33 µg/ ml or of the tetracaine metabolite 4-n-butylaminobenzoic acid up to 8.6 µg/ml was observed in Berlin. These high concentrations originated from the use of the local anaesthetics as adulterants in cocaine, heroin or cocaine-heroin mixtures. The comparison of the lidocaine concentrations with that of 38 fatalities with a different cause of death, in which the drug was used as an antiarrhythmic during resuscitation attempts (0.1-24 µg/ml) and with literature data on local anaesthesia accidents leads to the conclusion that in a substantial number of drug cases an intoxication by the local anaesthetics alone or in combination with other drugs is sufficient to death. In seven cases the concentration of 4-n-butylaminobenzoic acid was above 4 µg/ml (corresponding to > 5.5 µg/ml tetracaine). These values confirm the stronger toxicity of tetracaine in comparison to lidocaine known from the literature. As a reason for the particularly high danger of the use of local anaesthetics as adulterants in illicit drug mixtures, it must be assumed that after application of normal amounts by intravenous bolus injection, very high blood concentrations appear immediately in the heart and CNS, which cause death by central paralysis and blockade of the cardiac conduction system.
