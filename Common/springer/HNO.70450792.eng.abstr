Implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear, provided they are fully implantable. Accordingly, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, combined project was initiated at the ENT clinic of the University of Tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids.  A novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described. Unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far, this transducer does not rely on the bimorphic principle but on a circle-shaped, heteromorphic combination system consisting of a piezoceramic disc and metal membrane. The transducer can be hermetically sealed and is designed for implantation into the mastoid. Transfer of mechanical oscillations to an ossicle in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements. The transducer is highly tuned with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range (greater than 10 kHz). Below this resonance and down to low frequencies, the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around 20 nm. At low and middle frequencies of up to 1 kHz, these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound-pressure levels of around 90 dB SPL. At higher frequencies of up to 10 kHz, the output level increases to about 130 dB SPL. Nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels (less than 0.1%) throughout the whole transfer range. Electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few microwatts and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems. Particularly, this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss.
