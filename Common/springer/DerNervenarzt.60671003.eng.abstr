High-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (ivIg) are an effective therapy in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). In both diseases, data regarding ivIg long-term treatment are sparse. Therapy with ivIg was performed in 18 patients with CIDP or MMN. Sixteen patients responded to ivIg therapy; they were treated for more than 6 months. Two of them had not previously shown any positive response to other immunosuppressive treatments. Response to ivIg therapy could be observed even after a long disease duration (maximum of 19.5 years). All 16 therapy responders now have no or only mild clinical symptoms. Treatment could eventually be completely stopped in 6 patients; they have now been in complete remission without therapy for a maximum of 63 months. Ten patients still receive regular ivIg infusions in different dosages. No severe side effects were observed in the whole group. IvIg therapy is an effective, safe and easily applicable treatment regimen even in the long-term course of CIDP and MMN.
