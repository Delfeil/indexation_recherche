A method to determine migration of hip endoprostheses is described. Migration is measured by means of standard AP radiographs and therefore can also be evaluated in retrospective studies. Measurement is conducted on X-ray studies displayed on a computer screen. Enhancement of bony structures by application of filters is available. The developed software can be used with common commercially available computers and X-ray scanners, and does not require special hardware.
