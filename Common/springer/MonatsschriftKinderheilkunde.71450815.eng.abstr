Background: In congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency high pre- and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence psychosexual and psychosocial development in affected girls. Methods: In order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality-of-life study. We report on the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients (45) and their mothers (35) covering difficulties and problems in general, most aspects of their medical histology, self image, body image and current life with or without a male or female partner. Results: The patients were socially competent with a well developed social network. However, regarding sexual contacts they were shy and reluctant. These resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are married. Existing partnerships were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population. The incidence of homosexuality was not increased. The number of women having children was significantly reduced. A substantial number of women suffered from androgen-dependent problems like irrgular menses and hirsutism. Mothers and patients denied any sex-specific eduction, but the girls had preferred boy-specific toys and competitive outdoor games. However, school performance was average and comparable to the controls. Most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters intersexuality at birth. Even though they felt they had received good medical treatment, mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help. Conclusions: It seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease. Problems regarding partnership, sexuality, and fertility remain and have to be addressed.
