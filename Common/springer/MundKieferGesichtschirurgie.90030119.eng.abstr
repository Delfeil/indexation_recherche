A number of studies have previously been carried out on patients with tumors of the oral cavity, a majority of whom proved to be heavy smokers and heavy drinkers. However, we are not aware of literature reports relating to the converse situation: a study of alcoholics and strong smokers to establish the incidence of malignant processes of the oral cavity among them. Accordingly, the present aim was to  investigate the occurrence of oral cavity lesions among 300 subjects who were alcoholic and heavy smokers and of the opinion that they had no tumor. Malignant processes were detected in the oral cavity or its environment in 2.66% of the 300 subjects, and more than 19% of them were found to harbour benign tumors and precancerous lesions. These investigations highlight the importance of screening examinations of the endangered population.
