To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a primary extracranial meningioma located in the palatine tonsil. Immunohistochemical investigation of the tumour showed coexpression of vimentin and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). No staining was found with antibodies against cytokeratins KL 1, 13/10, 8 and 18, epithelial membrane antigen EMA and melanoma protein (HMB-45). It seems justifiable to classify this tumour as an atypical meningioma because of the local increased mitotic activity.
