(Acitve alert) Hypnosis and sports in the psychotherapy of out-patients with anxiety disorders. A process-oriented approach combining hypnotherapeutic with cognitive-behavioral concepts within a systemic model of psychotherapy for the outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders is outlined. The use of active alert hypnosis (hypnosis by bicycle ergometry) combining elements of hypnotherapy and sports therapy is adapted to patients characteristics and the process of therapy. Relaxation and active alert hypnosis and different sports are used as methods of cue exposure respectively training of competence. The treatment is sequentially structured (motivation, symptom-control, conflict, integration). Active alert hypnosis catalyses the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom-control (reduction of anxiety and depression) and of conflict (modifcation of intrapsychic conficts or traumata within trance induced by physical exercises). Therapeutic goals and techniques for each stage are specified by case examples.
