The term psychodynamic psychotherapy is used to describe different forms of therapies the characteristic feature of which is their relation to psychoanalytic theory. An attempt will be made to determine the characteristic features of a unified general form of psychodynamic therapy - to the extent permitted by the widely differing theoretical and clinical bases of existing psychotherapies. The basic standpoints of conflict-orientated vs supportive psychodynamic therapy are parts of 'general psychotherapy'. In spite of the need for a general bio-psycho-social psychotherapeutic framework, the possibility of a 'general psychotherapy' will be critically examined.
