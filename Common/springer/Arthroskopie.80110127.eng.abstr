Epicondylitis humeri radialis unimproved by medical treatment may be caused by intra-articular pathology, especially in the radiohumeral part of the elbow. Both, the lateral plica and the hypertrophic dorsoradial synovial fringe have to be considered. Clinical examination, progress, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and arthroscopy are the means of diagnosis. Arthroscopic treatment of the intra-articular pathology leads to prompt recovery. One surgeon treated 56 patients by arthroscopy of the elbow joint from January 1994 to December 1996. A total of 35 (63.6%) patients were diagnosed to have radiohumeral joint impingement. We present our findings (MRI, arthroscopic findings, and treatment) in all patients and the results of our investigation by questionnaire in the first 24 patients.
