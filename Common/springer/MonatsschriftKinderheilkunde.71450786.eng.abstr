Some of the most widely used alternative treatment methods for bronchial asthma are discussed. The relevant literature, especially controlled clinical studies for the evaluation of effectiveness, are reviewed. After briefly discussing definitions, sociodemographic data, and strategies to evaluate any treatment of bronchial asthma, the following methods are reviewed: Acupuncture,Homoeopathy, Yoga, Hypnosis, Autogenic training, Muscle relaxation treatment, Manual medicine, Ionisation of air, and Bioresonance. In summary, decently done clinical studies are scarce, and results, more often than not, are contradictory; Yoga, and possibly also Hypnosis, might be exceptions in this generally poor scientific profile; these two methods might have some therapeutic efficacy in asthma.
