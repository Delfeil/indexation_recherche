Background: As the slit-lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in-vivo examination and documentation of the multi-layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea, e. g. during wound-healing processes, our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (CLSO; Zeiss) into a high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system. In order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), as well as some in-vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).
