During a 7-year period (between July 1987 and June 1994) 19 patients were treated for Chopart dislocation. Seventeen patients were examined clinically 48 months following trauma. We found 1 excellent, 6 good, 6 mediocre, and 4 poor results. Only 4 patients were able to achieve their pre-accident level of work and no patients could return to sports at the same level. In our patients, Chopart dislocation had a negative social consequence both at the work place and in recreational activities. In long-term follow-up, the Chopart dislocation was the most debilitating injury even for polytrauma patients.
