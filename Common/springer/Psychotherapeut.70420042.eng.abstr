Morita-Therapie (MT) is an individual psychotherapy primarily designed for an inpatient setting. It is intended to restore in neurotic patients their ability to work and their social capacities. The therapeutic aim of "The Pure Soul" (jun na kokoro) and its variations are investigated and summarized with the term Morita-myth. Two empirical studies on MT were evaluated by using the questionaire of the metaanalysis project of Grawe a. o. (1994). From the perspective of this metaanalysis project, there is at present no empirical basis for its application. Following the standard, demanded by Meyer a. o. (1991) in the research paper for the Psychotherapists Bill, MT would hardly find any recognition today. It is suggested that extraclinical personal experience and supervision become part of the practice of Morita therapists.
