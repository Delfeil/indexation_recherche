Rocuronium is a new nondepolarizing muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described. The goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery. These operations, which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to "share" the patient's airway, require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments. In addition, the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed.
