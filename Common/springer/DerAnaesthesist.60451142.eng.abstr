During the last five years several authors have reported largely satisfactory results, using the steroid intravenous anaesthetic eltanolone (pregnanolone) for induction of anaesthesia after administering a bolus dose. Until now, however, no investigations have been undertaken, dealing with the infusion pharmacokinetics of eltanolone after arterial blood sampling and using slow induction to quantify the concentration-effect relationship. Secondary objectives were to assess the haemodynamic and respiratory effects.
