According to the ecological theory of Willi 1996, people create and maintain their psychic wellbeing through constant shaping of their environment, i.e. setting up a personal niche. The personal niche in turn responds to, guides and challenges further personal development. This study explores what kind of solutions single patients with psychiatric invalidity can find in order to form their environment as a niche in which they may develop effectiveness and use it for their psychic regulation. 30 people were questioned with a semi-structured interview: they were patients of a psychiatric out-patient's clinic, living alone and psychiatrically invalided (2/3 with schizophrenia of the residual type). The results were ranked after their increasing demands in a relational and in an activity inventory. The more relationship is based on mutuality expectations of others, personal disclosure and binding the more the subjects feel overstrained. The investigation of these inventories serve as a technical aid in supportive psychotherapy.
