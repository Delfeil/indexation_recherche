Endoscopic and open forms of surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome have been the subject of controversy. The main arguments against endoscopy in spite of the advantages of the procedure, i.e., small scars, low morbidity, are the reduced intraoperative overview of the anatomic site and the resulting risk of injury to the median nerve or flexor tendons. The most widely used endoscopic techniques were analyzed and the requirements for employing minimally invasive endoscopic procedures formulated. A newly developed technique which fulfills these requirements is presented. It incorporates a preparatory stage such that the structures which are to be protected or dissected can be viewed adequately. This surgical technique can even be employed in de Quervain's disease, whereby a very small skin incision can be used to dissect the first extensor tendon compartment.
