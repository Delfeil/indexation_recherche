 Traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia. In the hand, which is perfused by two arteries, this symptom could be missed. The hypothenar hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal arteria ulnaris. Dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late. A specific angiographic or duplex sonographic diagnostic investigation is necessary to show the arterial occlusion. There is no proven therapeutic procedure. Exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention.
