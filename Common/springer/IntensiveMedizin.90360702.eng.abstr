 Cytokines are inflammatory response mediators. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, TNF-) promote inflammation by recruitment of cells while others decrease the inflammatory response (e.g., interleukin-10). The role of cytokines in inflammatory lung disease has been widely investigated and this review tries to clarify the important question whether cytokine levels, in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, may help to distinguish adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from pneumonia in patients with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
