In spite of its serious sequelae, volatile substance abuse (VSA) attracts very little public attention in Germany. Our case report describes an adult male who inhaled propane for recreational purposes. Initially, he achieved short-lived euphoria and hallucinations. He compensated for the developing tolerance by increasing the dosage, finally consuming 5 litres of fluid propane daily. Getting such quantities was facilitated by his occupational access to propane. Since he abused the propane in an apartment house, he also exposed third parties to the danger of explosion. Clinical examination revealed disturbances in orientation, restricted perceptivity and concentration, reduced mnemonic performance, and psychomotor agitation. All these symptoms diminished during a 6-month follow-up. The relationship of his organic mental disorder to the abuse of propane was not clear, since he had also abused alcohol.
