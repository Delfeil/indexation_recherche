We represent and discuss etiology, diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous orchtitis referring to an actual case of this rare disease. In the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease. Other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease. Quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection veils the sterile leucocyturia as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis. Imaging diagnostics frequently fails to give indications of tuberculous origin of the lesion. As before the evidence of Mycobacteria tuberculosis is the most important parameter to proof a tuberculosis. Despite required microbiological cultivation to make a resistogram the polymerase chain reaction is a high sensitive and comparable fast method for detection of Mycobacteria even from tissue. In such dubious cases we recommend to perform an operative denudation due to frequently difficult delimitation from malignant testicular tumours.
