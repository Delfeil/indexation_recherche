Katayama syndrome is an allergic reaction of antigens of schistosomes, known as the acute phase of schistosomiasis. We report on an eleven year-old boy, who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to Malawi. Remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma-antigens. Six weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting eggs of Schistosoma haematobium in the urine. Praziquantel treatment was started. Parasitological examinations of urine and faeces four months later were negative.
