  Background: In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) therapy, surgical myectomy and DDD pacemaker implantation are considered to be established extensions to medical treatment. As an alternative procedure for reducing the left ventricular outflow track gradient (LVOTG), percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) by alcohol-induced septal branch occlusion has been introduced. We report on the acute results and the short-term clinical course following 66 PTSMA interventions in symptomatic patients (pts.) with HOCM.
