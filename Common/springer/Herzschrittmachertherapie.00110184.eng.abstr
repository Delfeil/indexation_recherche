 Background: The role of the cardiovascular system is to keep up an adequate perfusion pressure in order to maintain the homeostasis in the organism. In this context, the baroreceptor reflex, as the short-term mechanism, is of major importance. As a result of chronotropic incompetence, e.g. because of a dysfunction of the sinus node, the control mechanisms of the baroreceptor reflex do not function, changes of blood pressure are no longer adequately compensated and the heart rate is not adjusted to the current needs. The Inos2CLS pacemaker provides a system that includes the baroreceptor reflex in the regulation of the stimulation rate and the systemic blood pressure and thus reestablishes the functioning of the baroreceptor reflex.Aim of the study: Aim of the study was to prove that the baroreceptor reflex is included in the regulation of the stimulation rate by the pacemaker Inos2CLS. Furthermore, the functionality of the system under emotional and physical stress was tested.Methods: 30 patients (14 male, 16 female, mean age 70.9 +/- 7 years) were implanted with the pacemaker system Inos2CLS. In order to prove the inclusion of the baroreceptor reflex in the Closed Loop Stimulation, the patients had to perform the Valsalva maneuver at the 3-month follow-up investigation. Blood pressure as well as heart rate were continually recorded by a fina-press system. Afterwards, the patients had to perform a mental stress test (Color-Word Test). The physical stress was performed by a symptom-limited treadmill ergonometry. Blood pressure was recorded according to Riva/Rocci. The development of the rate as well as the differentiation between intrinsic and stimulated atrial events was recorded by the data analysis of the pacemaker.Results: All 28 patients, who were included in the investigation, showed a change in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate which is typical for the Valsalva maneuver. In phase 1 (rest) the MABP was 93 +/- 13mmHg, it increased in phase 2 to 113 +/- 21mmHg, and dropped in phase 3 to 84 +/- 16mmHg. A second peak in phase 4 was at 99 +/- 12mmHg. As expected, the MABP leveled off to 94 +/- 8mmHg. At the beginning of the test, the mean rate was at 73 +/- 10bpm and increased to a maximum in phase 3 of 88 +/- 12bpm. Splitting the patients into two groups, one patients <70years, the other patients >=70years, demonstrated that blood pressure and heart rate of the older group varied less. These results reflect the reduced baroreceptor sensitivity in elderly people and can be considered as a physiological phenomenon. During the first mental phase of the Color-Word Test, blood pressure and heart rate increased by 17mmHg and 6bpm, respectively. After a two-minute rest, the test was repeated. An analogous behavior of blood pressure and heart rate could be observed. The results of the treadmill ergonometry showed for all patients an adequate development of blood pressure and heart rate, adapted to the actual situation. The exemplary development of blood pressure and heart rate of a female patient (53years, 172cm, 98kg, indication sicksinus syndrome) showed that only stimulated atrial events could be observed up to the aerobic-anaerobic threshold. When stress increased, the patient's sinus node controlled the heart rate.Conclusion: This study suggests that the Closed Loop Stimulation reestablishes the baroreceptor reflex in the case of chronotropic incompetence. By simply monitoring the contraction dynamics without any further sensor systems, it may be possible to offer an optimal rate adaptation in mental and physical stress situations in the case of bradyarrhythmia combined with chronotropic incompetence. Because of the reestablishment of the baroreceptor reflex, it can be expected that the patients' prognosis improves significantly and, leads to an increase of the patients' "quality of life".
