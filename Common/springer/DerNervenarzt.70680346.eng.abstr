Dislocation of the temporomandibular joint results from trauma, articulation disorders and changes in the equilibrium of the masticatory muscles. Previous classifications were mostly oriented on the interrelationships between the anatomical positions of the dislocated articular surfaces, like luxation, subluxation and discus luxation. Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations. Dislocation of the temporomandibular joint is described as a complication of a number of neurological deseases. We report on a patient who suffered recurrent dislocations of the temporomandibular joint as a complication of multiple sclerosis and whose luxations were successfully treated with botulinum toxin, thus warranting the introduction of the term "neurogenic dislocation of the temporomandibular joint".
