 The implantation of a mesh is an essential step in laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery. We present the case of a 22-year-old man who developed an unspecific and refractory syndrome of inguinal pain after a TAPP procedure for a primary inguinal hernia. Repeated reoperation for removement of clips and nerve transection were unsuccessful. By a transinguinal approach, 18 months after the first operation we removed a preperitoneal Prolene mesh which had shrunk and folded to 30 % of its original size. The problem of biocompatibility of meshes currently used in inguinal hernia surgery is discussed.
