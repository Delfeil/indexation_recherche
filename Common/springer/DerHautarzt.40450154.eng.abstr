Abstract.  In several cases of lupus erythematosus (SLE, SCLE, DLE), the Koebner phenomenon could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas, scratching effects, operation scars, contact dermatitis, pressure from sock tops, application of liquid nitrogen, exposure to strong sun light, etc. The interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case. In SLE patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, the Koebner phenomenon could not be found, while it was detected in patients with generalized DLE who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones. It was not seen in patients with localized DLE. There was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the Koebner phenomenon. With regard to the histopathogenesis of the Koebner phenomenon, it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network, with expression of adhesion molecules, might be involved. The Koebner phenomenon may be a valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus.
