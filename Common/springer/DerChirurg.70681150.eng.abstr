 There is no consensus regarding the clinical significance of conventional two-dimensional ultrasound in the diagnosis of meniscal tears of the knee. Three-dimensional ultrasound spatially reconstructs a transparent image of subsequent ultrasound scans. In an experimental study of 96 menisci, radial and oblique tears were detected more often by three-dimensional ultrasound. In a clinical study of 60 menisci the two- and three-dimensional ultrasound reached a sensitivity of 92 % and 100 %, a specificity of 83 % and 88 %, a positive predictive value of 58 % and 67 %, and a negative predictive value of 98 % and 100 %, respectively. Altogether, there was no statistically significant difference between both methods. The high negative predictive value, however, shows that the three-dimensional ultrasound may be a clinically relevant examination for special questions in the diagnostics of meniscal tears.
