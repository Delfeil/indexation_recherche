 Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease-modifying drugs aims to better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy. Subsequent to a paper written two years ago, this publication review studies dealing with combination therapy issued mainly in 1995 and 1996. Most studies deal with MTX as one of the partners. Beneficial results were reported for the combination of methotrexate with antimalarials, cyclosporine or sulfasalazine. The triple combination of methotrexate with hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine is especially promising although the studies presented up to now are still insufficient for its final assessment, due to methodologic problems. Similarly, the value of the combination of sulfasalazine with injectable gold, of sulfasalazine with methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine, or of methotrexate with injectable gold is still uncertain.
