Between 1985 and 1993 only 5 children per year were treated for HUS in the Pediatric Nephrology Unit in Münster, whereas 15 (9 girls and 6 boys) were admitted between March to September 1994. 12 of 15 children were 1 to 3 years old. Few days before HUS developed all of them suffered from haemorrhagic diarrhea, two showed CNS-affections, five hypertension, and six suffered from severe pancreatitis. In four families EHEC-food infection was suspected. 2-5 days before diarrhea two children had drank raw milk, one child had consumed undercooked ground beef and another one chicken. We suspect a counection between the increase in verotoxine-producing E. coli especially in cattle (therefore involving the contamination of meat and dairy products) and the increase of HUS. Evidence relating to the patients' histories, their environment, and the incidence of infections in their families supports this hypothesis. In conclusion, to avoid EHEC-transmission, precise records of HUS-infected children must be kept including details of diet, family history and surroundings. Parents should be informed of preventive measures such as boiling unpasteurised milk and thoroughly cooking meat.
