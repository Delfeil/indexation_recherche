Introduction: Untreated CMV retinitis with AIDS leads to blindness; therefore, a life-long virostatic treatment is required. It can either be administered systemically or locally, as there are different advantages and disadvantages. When treating patients we aim at therapy that preserves vision without diminishing quality of life. It should induce as few drug-induced side effects as possible and not shorten the patient's life expectation.
