 The RS3PE syndrome (Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Edema) is a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly with a good prognosis. It usually presents as an acute, symmetric polysynovitis with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet. Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement. We describe the case of an 81 year old man with a primarily unilateral manifestation involving the right hand. A thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected. Within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand. Movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful. Low-dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms.
