Chorioamnionitis has to be considered a uterine infection while the fetus remains inside. Ascending aerobe and anaerobe bacteria are mainly responsible for chorioamnionitis. Amniotic inflammation occurs in 2-4 % of all pregnancies. Women with preterm deliveries and premature rupture of the membrane have an increased risk for developing chorioamnionitis. The published infection rate of the uterus cavity ranges from 10 to 50 %. In 5-10 % of threatened preterm births the intrauterine infection is detectable. Currently, simple test systems are available for analyses of gram-positive bacteria, leukocyte number, cytokines and concentration of glucose in the amniotic fluid completed by cultures for bacteria. The signs and symptoms of chorioamnionitis include elevated maternal temperature (oral 37.5  °C; rectal 38.0  °C), fetal or maternal tachycardia, and uterine contractions or tenderness. The C-reactive protein (CRP) is still the best serum parameter to predict amniotic infection. The two major problems of amniotic inflammation are septic shock for the mother and involvement of the placenta and fetus. To prevent these complications high-dose antibiotics are necessary and immediate delivery should be considered. The local and systemic spread is due to delayed diagnosis and may present as myometritis, endomyometritis, peritonitis, bacteremia, septic pneumonia or shock lung. Additionally, an infection of group B streptococci increases the risk for development of maternal meningitis.
