The study consists of a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Besides medical and sociodemographic data, two personality factors - self-efficacy and locus of control - were found to predict postoperative pain. Self-efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully execute the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes. Locus of control, in the extreme case, is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action, versus an external orientation, in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate. We postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them.
