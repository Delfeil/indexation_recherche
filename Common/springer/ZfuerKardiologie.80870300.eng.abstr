  A 23 year old man, having experienced sudden retrosternal pain, radiating to both hemithoraces, with dyspnea at rest was admitted to another hospital. The physical examination of heart and lung was unremarkable, but the patient showed discrete signs of a respiratory infection. Because of the young age and the history of a respiratory infection, the differential diagnosis perimyocarditis was favored and an appropriate treatment was begun. Five days later the patient was transferred to our center for cardiac catheterization and further treatment. After admission the patient was reported to be hit by a football shortly before the onset of symptoms.
