 From 1. 11. 93 to 30. 3. 97, 1149 patients were prospectively studied during their ICU stay. Of them,114 met the criteria of septic shock, with lethality of 47.3 %. A neural network was trained with datasets from 91 of these 114 patients. Testing the trained neural network with the remaining 23 patients, the following result was obtained: all 10 patients dying from septic shock were correctly predicted; of 13 surviving patients, 12 were correctly identified (sensitivity 100 %; specifity 92.3 %).
