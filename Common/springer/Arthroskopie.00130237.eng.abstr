The purpose of this study was to review our experience of arthroscopic repair of acute anterior shoulder dislocation, focussing on comparing the time of surgery from the date of injury with the incidence of arthrofibrosis. During a 20-month period, 18 patients underwent arthroscopic stabilization after acute, primary shoulder dislocation. The operative technique was standardized. The population was subdivided into three groups, regarding the interval between the date of trauma and injury. Group 1, surgery during the first week; group 2, surgery between the second and fourth week; and group 3, surgery after the fifth week. The average interval between trauma and surgery was 132.5 days (range, 6-470). The postoperative standardized rehabilitation protocol was the same for all patients. The follow-up was after 3 months. Preoperatively, we found a free range of motion in all patients. After 3 months post-surgery, we observed a limited range of motion in 7 patients. The average interval between trauma and time of surgery was 36.4 days (range, 6-73 days). In 11 patients we found a free range of motion. Here the trauma-surgery interval was 188 days (range, 60-380). In group 1 and 2, all patients showed limited range of motion in their shoulder (n = 4). In group 3, patients were limited in range of motion (26.7%). However, these patients had a recognizably shorter trauma-surgery interval (53.25 days) than the other 11 patients in this group (193.6 days). Arthrofibrosis occurred in 7 cases (38.8%), 3 months after surgery. These patients underwent surgery between day 6 and 73 after trauma. However, stabilization during the first 4 weeks showed a trend for an increased risk of arthrofibrosis. Therefore, attention should be paid to the complication of arthrofibrosis in acute arthroscopic shoulder stabilization.
