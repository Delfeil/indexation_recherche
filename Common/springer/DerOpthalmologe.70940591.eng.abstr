Background: Borrelia burgdorferi is the cause of erythema chronicum migrans and Lyme disease. Ticks like Ixodes ricinus are responsible for transmission. Frequently, the tick bite is not noticed by the patient. Eye manifestations, such as keratoconjunctivitis, scleritis, chronic uveitis, vitritis, chorioretinitis, optic nerve disease, orbital myositis and paresis of the eye muscles, often occur after a long period of time and vary greatly.
