On the background of growing insight that conversion is not restricted to hysteric phenomena, an operational definition of this classic psychosomatic concept is presented. The operational attempt includes definite psychodynamic features but tries to counteract the proliferating use of the conversion concept, which in fact devaluates the concept. The course of the operational process is illustrated in 3 steps, starting with a concensus definition, leading on to a presentation of 11 dynamic elements of the conversion concept with the aim of reducing it's complexity, and ending with the operational definition itself.
