 Here, we present the so-called "Vollmer retractor", which can be fixed on to the operating table. It allows an optimal transference of the traction force on to the border of the wound, both in upper and lower abdominal interventions. In this way, as shown by our recent experience, we gain an optimal view of the subdiaphragmatic area and into the small pelvis.
