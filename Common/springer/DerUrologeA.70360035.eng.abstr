Medical therapy in the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia has changed very much during the last few years. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, which inhibits the predominant intraprostatic isoenzyme II of 5-alpha-reductase and therefore DHT, which is - among other factors - essential for the physiological growth of the prostate. However, it also has an important influence on developing BPH. It was shown in several studies that finasteride can increase urinary flow rates, decrease the prostate volume, and improve the symptom score and PSA value. The objective improvement in urinary flow rates was only moderate, but better results were obtained in the improvement of patient symptoms. Large multicenter studies will be conducted to see if the efficacy of treatment can be improved by combination therapy with alpha-1-blockers.
