 In this paper the basic features of acute, subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis, skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms, culture studies, laboratory studies and radiological signs. The common conservative and surgical treatments are discussed. In the treatment of post-traumatic/postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of multiresistant strains. Thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics, a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed. Despite this improved prognosis, an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon.
