Endothelially derived nitric oxide (NO) regulates vasodilatation via relaxation of the smooth muscle cells and inhibits platelet aggregation in addition to a number of other biological processes. Animal experiments have provided evidence for increased NO production in the normal pregnancy. This contributes to the decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and to the increased glomerular filtration rate. Inhibition of NO synthesis is associated with a preeclampsia-like syndrome in various animal species. In vivo and in vitro data in the human pregnancy have indicated that NO deficiency contributes to the vasoconstriction seen in preeclampsia. However, due to the short half-life time of NO, pharmacological application is only possible by NO-donating drugs such as glycerol trinitrate (GTN, "nitroglycerine"), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) or S-nitrosoglutathion (GSNO). There is limited experience with the use of NO donors in human pregnancy; yet no teratogenic or embryotoxic effects are reported. According to current knowledge, transdermal application of GTN in pregnancy is safe with only minor effects on maternal blood pressure and without compromising the uteroplacental perfusion in patients with preeclampsia. Up to now only one prospective randomized trial has been conducted on the prophylaxis of preeclampsia by NO donors in women at high risk for development of the disease. However, the sample size of this study was too small to allow final conclusions. There are no randomized trials on the therapy of preeclampsia by NO donors reported in the literature. Therefore, it is that the use of NO donors be evaluated in the prophylaxis and therapy of preeclampsia only recommended in the context of clinical trials.
