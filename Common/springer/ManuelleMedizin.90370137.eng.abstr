Patients who have to undergo anesthesia with intubation and neuromuscular relaxation often complain of pain in the neck, resulting from joint blockage of the cervical spine. Often the intubation is held to be responsible for this fact, although this assumption has not really been examined. Earlier studies have show that intraoperative manipulation and movement of the patient like making the patient lie down under neuromuscular blocking or an extreme posture could be of greater influence than intubation for the occurrence of joint blockage.
