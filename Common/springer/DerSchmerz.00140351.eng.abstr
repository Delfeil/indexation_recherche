Background. Headaches are one of the most common health problems of children and adolescents, afflicting between 50-90% of the pediatric population in some form sometimes during their first two decades of life. Due to changing prevalence rates, more or less complex classification systems, inconsistent therapy responses with great inter- and intraindividual variabilities and high placebo response rates, pediatric headache syndromes are frequently thought to be too difficult for the outpatient evaluation and treatment in clinical practice.
