 This paper reports our experience in surgery for hemodialysis access. In the period from 1983 to 1995, 728 operative procedures for hemodialysis access shunts were carried out. These were performed in 391 patients. A total of 599 shunts were placed as the primary form of access, including 423 autologous fistulas in the forearm and 144 in the upper arm. Additionally, 30 PTFE grafts were placed. As proposed, we have seen good functional results of the Brescia-Cimino-fistula in the forearm. Shunts in the upper arm show similar results but a higher rate of complications. PTFE grafts are associated with multiple complications and show a significantly lower rate of patency.
