The interval between the onset of symptoms in patients with head and neck cancers and the introduction of treatment was evaluated. During a 1-year period, patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor. Also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ENT specialist and actual referral to our department. We then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy. It was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter (median, 8 weeks) than that of patients who first went to their family doctors (median, 13 weeks) (P<0.02). The latter then took an additional 4 weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist. Referral from the ENT specialist to our department took another 2 weeks, as well as our staging and pre-therapeutic management. Our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy. Tumor patients with greater professional qualification went to their doctors earlier (P<0.0001) or more often went directly to an ENT specialist (P<0.002). Consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays.
