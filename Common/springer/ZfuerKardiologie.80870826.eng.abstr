  The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of sleep related breathing disorders (SRBD) in patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and to evaluate prospectively the possible influence of SRBD on arrhythmia recurrence and circadian arrhythmia variation as well as on cardiac mortality during long-term follow-up. Forty consecutive ICD recipients with cardiac disease and a documented history of spontaneous, life-threatening, ventricular tachyarrhythmias underwent fullnight polysomnography and were followed for 2 years. In 16 of 40 patients (40%), SRBD were diagnosed (Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) >10); in 9 of these 16 patients (56%) central sleep apneas (CSA) occurred (in 8 of these 9 patients in combination with Cheyne-Stokes respiration). Seven of the 16 patients with SRBD (44%) revealed obstructive sleep apneas (OSA). AHI was 32 +/- 15 (12-60) in patients with CSA and 32 +/- 27 (11-86) in patients with OSA. Patients with and without SRBD were comparable concerning left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA classification, cardiac disease, ICD indication, and concomitant medication. ICD registered ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurred in 10 of 24 patients (42%) without SRBD, in 4 of 9 patients (44%) with CSA, and in 3 of 7 patients (44%) with OSA. The numbers and circadian variation of episodes registered during follow-up in patients without SRBD, with OSA or CSA were comparable (14 +/- 25, median 4 vs 15 +/- 15, median 7 vs 4 +/- 5, median 2.5). The 2-year cardiac mortality was highest in patients with CSA (4/9 (44%) vs 0/7 patients (0%) with OSA vs 3/24 patients (12.5%) without SRBD. Thus, the prevalence of SRBD in patients with chronic heart failure and a history of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias is high (40%) and the occurrence of CSA seems to be predictive for cardiac mortality in these patients. An influence of moderate SRBD on arrhythmia recurrence and circadian variation of spontaneous sustained tachyarrhythmic events could not be demonstrated.
