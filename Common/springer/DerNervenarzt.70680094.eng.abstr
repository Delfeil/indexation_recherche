Extensive research in the field of multiple sclerosis (MS) has lead to a preliminary pathogenetic concept without solving the etiopathogenesis. According to animal experiments and human in vitro studies MS is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Experimental therapeutical strategies are aiming at the inhibition of T cell activation, transmigration through the blood brain barrier and local inflammation and demyelination. Several substances are already being tested in clinical studies with magnetic resonance imaging as a tool to quantify inflammatory lesions and to shorten the study course. This review will give a summary about actual experimental therapies resulting from the current pathogenetic concept.
