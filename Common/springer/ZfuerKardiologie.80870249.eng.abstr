  Diagnostic and interventional heart catheterization in peripheral vascular disease often requires due to iliacal disease additional methods of arterial approach besides the Judkin's technique. The percutaneous catheterization of the brachial artery finds widespread use. A major complication linked with this method is an increased rate of thrombotic occlusions at the puncture site. Thus, we investigated in a prospective set-up the ability of duplex ultrasound to identify predictive risk factors for vascular complications. Over a period of 20 months, 8000 patients referred to heart catheterization were studied. Routine catheterization via the femoral route was contraindicated in 34 out of 8000 mostly due to severe peripheral vascular disease with multiple vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertention, and smoking). 53 patients who had a comparable low riskprofile served as the control group. The brachial artery was examined by ultrasound duplex for vessel anatomy and diameter at the puncture site before coronary angiography.
