Abstract.  We report on a case of secondary syphilis that became clinically manifest as partially erosive, almost asymptomatic lesions of the oral mucosa. Dark-field microscopy, typical serological parameters and the presence of spirochetes in the biopsy material promptly led to the diagnosis. Depending on the clinical picture, the possibility of syphilis should not be overlooked in the differential diagnosis of disease of the oral mucosa.
