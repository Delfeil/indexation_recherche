  Techniques in the field of coronary artery imaging can be divided into two groups: invasive and non-invasive methods. Apart from the conventional coronary artery angiography, invasive methods include intracoronary ultrasound, intracoronary angioscopy, and optical coherence tomography. Non-invasive methods include magnetic resonance tomography, synchrotron-coronary angiography, and electron beam computed tomography. In the late 1980s, intracoronary ultrasound has come into clinical practice. It offers a real-time, cross-sectional image of the coronary artery in high resolution. Coronary arteries enlarge in the presence of atherosclerotic plaque formation in order to compensate for luminal narrowing caused by plaque formation (remodeling). With coronary angiography, the plaque formation cannot be detected until a lumen reduction of about 40-45%. With intravascular ultrasound, the early stages of atherosclerosis can clearly be demonstrated. In combination with the intracoronary Doppler technique, syndrome X can be differentiated. Another important role of intracoronary ultrasound in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease is to guide coronary interventions and to assess the result of coronary interventions especially to evaluate the result of stent implantation. Due to the clinical use of intracoronary ultrasound and the guidance of high pressure stent implantation, the incidence of acute stent thrombosis has decreased to about 1%. Coronary angioscopy portrays the surface of the vessel lumen. It is helpful to identify the mural thrombus especially to differentiate fresh and chronic thrombus formation.
