The aim of the present study was to test polylactic acid material as a controlled release carrier for polypeptide growth factors. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was incorporated into DL polylactic acid (PLA) pellets under hyperbaric CO2 pressure in two different ways. (1) Lyophilized bFGF was crushed and mixed with PLA granules, filled into cylindric moulds of 5 x 3 mm, and submitted to hyperbaric CO2 pressure. (2) Lyophilized bFGF was reconstituted in phosphate buffer, mixed with PLA granules, and relyophilized. In vitro assessment of bFGF release from the PLA implants by immunoassay showed that loading of PLA with crushed lyophilized bFGF resulted in a rapid and high release, while loading by solubilized bFGF and relyophilization led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor.
