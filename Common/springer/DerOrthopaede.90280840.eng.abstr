The development of arthroscopic wrist surgery has helped to understand the anatomy and pathology of the wrist joint. One of the most important functions of the arthroscopic inspection in the radiocarpal and mediocarpal joints is the evaluation of the wrist stability. State of the art in the hand surgery today includes a combination of arthroscopic and arthroscopic assisted operations. The arthroscopy of the wrist offers significant information independent from the standard radiological diagnostic tools. TFCC lesions and scapholunate dissociation remain to be the most common causes for arthroscopic wrist surgery.
