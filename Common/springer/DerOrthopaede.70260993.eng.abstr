Load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation. The loading which can primarily be influenced are impact situations and friction as well as the stability of the foot. This stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury. However, a certain amount of loading is necessary to improve strength and structure of biological materials. In the past, the development of shoe and surface materials has hardly been perceived under this aspect, but may be increasingly important in the future.
