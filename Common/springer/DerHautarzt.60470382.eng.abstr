A 25-year-old carpenter with severe localised Raynaud syndrome of the lateral three fingers of his right hand is described. The patient reported digital ischaemia caused by cold or vibration, and especially when both were present simultaneously. He was initially diagnosed with thrombangitis obliterans, but failed to respond to intravenous prostaglandin therapy, pentoxifyllin or aspirin. Diagnostic procedures performed in our hospital, especially angiography, confirmed our suspicion of hypothenar hammer syndrome. Radiological examination revealed severe anatomical and functional changes of the distal ulnar artery and, digital arteries of the affected digits. The differential diagnosis of Raynaud syndrome should include the hypothenar hammer syndrome as a possible cause. Early diagnosis and prevention of hand trauma is the only possible way to stop progression of this disease, which leads to invalidity.
