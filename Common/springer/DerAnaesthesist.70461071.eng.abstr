The various components of commercial soda lime (sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide) were studied in terms of their reactivity with sevoflurane at its boiling point (59 ° C). A simple closed system, a reflux cooler, served as a model. Analyses were performed by GC/MS. Besides sevoflurane, we identified four compounds: A, B, C, and D. Free methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid could not be found. Presumably methanol is transferred from an intermediate formalin-semiacetal of the hexafluorisopropanol. Calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide showed little reaction with sevoflurane, whereas larger amounts of reaction products were observed with sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The alkali hydroxides of sodalime are presumably responsible for its reaction with halogenated inhalation anaesthetics. We therefore conclude that decomposing reactions of halogenated inhalation anesthetics with dry soda lime could be prevented by using a newly developed soda lime.
