The new inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane is biotransformed by approximately 5%. Serum fluoride concentrations resulting from transformation mainly depend on rate of hepatic defluorination, total amount of anesthetic given and the solubility of the volatile anesthetic, as expressed by its blood gas partition coefficient. Enflurane is metabolized by 5-11%. However subsequent peak fluoride levels are lower than after sevoflurane which is a consequence of its lower rate of hepatic defluorination. To date numerous studies have examined the nephrotoxic potential of the sevoflurane degradation product fluoride. However, fluoride-related toxicity was not observed, neither in clinical or in animal studies, nor after prolonged administration or in patients with preexisting renal disease. New insights into intrarenal metabolisation of volatile anesthetics may well explain absence of nephrotoxicity after sevoflurane. The threshold of fluoride nephrotoxicity of 50 µmol/l, which has been empirically found after methoxyflurane, and which is still listed in many medical textbooks, can not be assumed a marker of nephrotoxicity after isoflurane, enflurane or sevoflurane. Therefore also, the elevated serum fluoride concentrations, as regularly obtained after anesthesia with sevoflurane are devoid of clinical significance. In addition, exposure to sevoflurane or its metabolites is not associated with hepatic toxicity.
