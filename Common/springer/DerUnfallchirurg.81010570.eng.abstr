A 3-year-old child was trapped under the heavy load of a forklift truck and sustained an unstable pelvic ring fracture (Tile type C) with complete SI disruption, disruption of the pubic symphysis and external rotation injury of the contralateral SI joint. An immediate internal fixation was performed, exposing the SI joint and the pubic symphysis simultaneously. For stabilization an H-plate was used for anterior plate fixation of the SI joint, while the pubic symphysis was stabilized by screws and cerclage wires. After one revision of the symphysis the clinical course was uneventful with anatomical healing of the pelvic ring. The implants were removed after 4 months. Clinical and radiological follow-up after 12 months showed no signs of maldevelopment of the pelvic ring.
