 Dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response. Experimental findings in apoptotic keratinocytes and C1q knock-out mice suggest an important role of C1q in the clearance of apoptotic cell material. In addition, there are several links between C1q and SLE: Most the patients with C1q deficiency develop a SLE-like syndrome. SLE itself often causes secondary C1q deficiency and autoantibodies to C1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis. These observations suggest a central role of C1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of SLE.
