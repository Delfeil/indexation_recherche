Reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient. Methods of navel reconstruction are found in the literature but do not provide an elegant solution to the problem. Our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure, by creation of two opposing trapezoidal skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body; the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the linea alba. Reconstruction has been successfully carried out in this way after melanoma excision in 7 patients.
