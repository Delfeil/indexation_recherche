The situation of psychiatric patients in the Ukraine is determined by the financial and economic difficulties of this country. In the larger cities, so-called polyclinics take care of ambulant psychiatric patients. However, no other social psychiatric institutions exist. Here, the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in Kiev and Shitomir as examples. Undertreatment is also a problem, because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the Ukraine. Import of new psychopharmacological agents is hampered by economical problems. Improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in Ukraine.
