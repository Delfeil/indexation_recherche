We report on a 2-year-old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC). Concomitantly with a feverish gastrointestinal infection caused by Salmonella enteritidis, the child presented with lesions resembling impetigo contagiosa on the legs and face. Following antibiotic treatment with cephalosporins p.o. and flucloxacillin i.v. she developed typical symptoms of CBDC, i.e. tense blisters on erythematous skin in the perineal area, on the flexor aspects of the thighs and upper arms and on the face. Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone, confirming the diagnosis of CBDC. These lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p.o. This case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis, clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood.
