The purpose of the present investigation is a comparative study between conventional mechanical therapy methods and laser-supported techniques in the arthroscopic treatment of chondropathy of the knee joint. A total of 102 patients could be classified in two groups. In the first group (n = 52 patients), a Holmium-YAG-laser was used. In the second group (n = 50 patients), conventional mechanical instruments (milling cutter, rigid cut and branching instruments) were utilized. Determining criteria were degenerative or post-traumatic lesions of the cartilage. With regard to the severity of the lesion, the localization, the distribution of age and sex, the duration of the operation and the perioperative treatment, there was no difference between the two patient groups. After an average follow-up period of 21 months, all patients answered a standardized questionnaire, which included measurements of the Lysholm score and pain determination with the help of a visual analog scale. In group 1, 49 patients and in group 2, 45 patients could be examined clinically. With regard to the objective findings, there were no significant differences between the groups. A significant positive result was found in the laser-treated group with regard to pain perception, as measured by the visual analog scale. The subjective data, determined by the Lysholm scores collected through individual questionnaires, showed statistically significant improvements in results from the laser-treated group for a number of criteria (total value of the Lysholm score, climbing a staircase without pain, subjective sense of pain, willingness to repeat the operation).
