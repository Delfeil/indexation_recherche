Partial priapism is a rare condition which has been previously reported in the literature only in eight cases. Unlike the typical case of priapism, patial priapism generally shows erection only of the proximal corpora cavernosa. In most of the cases a well defined membrane separated the proximal erected and the distal flaccid part of the corpus. The origin of the fibrous membrane is not clear. Usually a painful segmental thrombosis of the corpora cavernosa was found proximal the membrane. Until 1985 diagnosis and therapy of this entity have principially involved invasiv methods. Later computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) were used for noninvasive imaging and conservative management was elected. We report a case of partial priapism and review the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in the previous literature.
