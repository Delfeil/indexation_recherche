Regular examinations of prostitutes may reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in this high risk group. Therefore since April 1988 regular mandatory examinations have been offered by the regional health office in cooperation with the Department of Dermatology of the Ruhr-University of Bochum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of such an examination. The study was based on anonymous questionnaires. Mean age of the 80 prostitutes was 31.4; 67 of then were born in Germany. 78 of the women always used condoms, while 71 thought that condoms prevent STDs. Three women suffered from a STD in the last 12 months. The majority the women (75 from this 80 prostitutes) did not perceive the examination as discrimination, while 71 felt the examinations were of high quality. These results indicate that regular mandatory examinations should be part of health prevention care of prostitutes and that they are well accepted and tolerated by these women.
