The Raynaud phenomenon occurs in 90-100% of patients with systemic scleroderma. It is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between vasocontrictive and vasodilatory influences. Early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances. Structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm. New vasodilatory treatment strategies, e.g. infusions with calcitonin gene-related peptides, could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma.
