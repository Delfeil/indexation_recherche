Background: In proliferative vitreoretinopathy and choroidal neovascularization, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells proliferate among other cell types. Cell proliferation is controlled by many factors. One such factor is the "superfamily" of nuclear receptors. Ligands of these receptors are vitamin A and D, triiodothyronine and dexamethasone. All-trans-retinal (atR) inhibits human RPE-cell proliferation. AtR binds to the nuclear ligand-dependent transcription factors RAR (retinoic acid receptor) and RXR (retinoid X receptor). Pharmacodynamics of atR were investigated with respect to inhibition of RPE cell proliferation.
