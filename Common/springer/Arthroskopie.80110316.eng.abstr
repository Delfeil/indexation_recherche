Three case reports of a pseudomeniscus and an angiomatoid vascular proliferation of the synovial membrane as rare aseptic complications of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty are presented. Neither complication can be confirmed by clinical examination, laboratory findings or diagnostic imaging techniques. Arthroscopy of the knee joint permits both diagnostic evaluation and low-risk surgical treatment.
