 Objective: To evaluate the performance of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) in critical ill patients of a medical ICU with bronchial and pulmonary diseases. Background: Evaluations of the prognostic power of SAPS II in groups of patients with homogeneous etiologies of critical illness came to quite different results. The predictive power of a score system must be reevaluated before reliable conclusions can be drawn in given groups of patients. Methods: SAPS II score, risk of death, outcome of hospital treatment (died, survived), age, length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital, underlying disease were recorded in all 262 critically ill patients with bronchial or pulmonary diseases out of a total group of 3797 intensive care patients treated in the medical ICU of a community teaching hospital (1995-1998). Patients treated with artificial ventilation were considered as a subgroup. ROC curves and area under curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate discrimination power. A formal goodness-of-fit test was performed, and a calibration curve calculated to evaluate calibration. Results: In 262 critically ill patients with bronchopulmonary diseases, mean age was 60.4 +/- 17.9 y, SAPS II 34.9 +/- 20.2, median risk of death 0.09 (25%; 75% percentile 0.03; 0.42), mortality in the ICU 9.9%, hospital mortality 17.2%, standardized mortality index 0.68 (0.57-0.83; 95% convidence interval). The AUC was 0.83 +/- 0.03. Chi2 was 40.16 and the p value 0.001 for the goodness-of-fit test. The calibration curve demonstrated significant overestimation of predicted hospital death in patients with a risk of death >0.4. Conclusion: SAPS II had a strong discrimination poor, but a poor calibration performance in critically ill patients of the bronchopulmonary disease category. For investigations requiring a very accurate prediction of hospital outcome across all classes of mortality risk, the score must be adjusted to the group of patients under investigation.
