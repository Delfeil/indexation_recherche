 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are established drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure and hypertension. There is mounting evidence to suggest that ACE inhibitors may be used for different indications as well. The rational for the use of ACE inhibitors is to block the vasoconstrictive effects mediated by angiotensin II. The hemodynamic profile of ACE inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the degredation of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide (NO). Thus ACE inhibitors may be successful in preventing the negative effects of vasoconstriction on regional circulation. Since vasoconstriction, particularly of the mesenteric vasculature appears to be largely mediated by the renin-angiotensin-axis, ACE inhibitors are assumed to be effective in treating or avoiding gut mucosal hypoperfusion. The critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is still a major therapeutic challenge. Intravenous preparations of ACE inhibitors may broaden our therapeutic armamentarium for these patients. However, several questions about the exact mechanisms of ACE inhibitors, such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose, are still open. Moreover, further work needs to be done to definitely determine whether ACE inhibitors may be helpful to prevent or treat (micro-) circulatory catastrophe in these patients. The pharmacologic properties of ACE inhibitors provide an exciting stepping stone for future research in this field.
