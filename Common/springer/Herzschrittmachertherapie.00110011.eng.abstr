 Epicardial structures are only rarely used for mapping and ablation of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias with the exception of WPW syndromes. However in a small percentage of patients obviously presenting an epicardial course of their arrhythmogenic structures, it may become necessary to seek out coronary veins and arteries in order to localize and eventually directly ablate the foci. Only single experiences are available in coronary vein mapping for ventricular tachycardias. In particular non-ischemic conditions like Chagas' disease, dilative cardiomyopathy and idiopathic left ventricular tachycardias tend to demonstrate an epicardial origin respectively breakthrough. By multipolar mapping using 2-3 French microcatheters with up to 16 poles, almost all coronary vein regions and arrhythmogenic foci can be reached respectively identified. In exceptional cases, microcatheter mapping may also be carried out in coronary arteries for localizing ventricular tachycardias for example due to remote myocardial infarction. Recently a direct approach to the epicardial space by transthoracic pericardial puncture has been introduced to perform a complete mapping of the epicardial surface not being limited by vascular structures. While coronary vein mapping can be considered a safe, reliable and helpful aid in identifying and localizing epicardial arrhythmogenic foci, the different ablative procedures still need to be evaluated and standardized with respect to safety and efficacy.   Multipolar basket mapping means an endocardial mapping procedure using a flexible basket consisting of up to 8 arms provided with multiple electrodes. After introducing the basket through a guiding catheter into the ventricle, the basket is distended and attached to the endocardium. An induced ventricular tachycardia may be mapped in seconds making this technique advantageous for nonsustained ventricular tachycardias. Initial results indicate basket mapping to be efficacious and relatively safe. At present, computer-based animation techniques are being evaluated for the transfer of the large amount of endocardial signal data registered into a three-dimensional  coordinate system in order to guide the ablation catheter. Before basket mapping may be considered a clinically established tool, further developments and studies comparing basket with other mapping techniques are needed.
