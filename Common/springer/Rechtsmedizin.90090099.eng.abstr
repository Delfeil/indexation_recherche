 Automobile-pedestrian accidents with the victim being dragged over long distances are very infrequent. However, in the majority of cases the victims were lying on the road and often heavily intoxicated. After the vehicle drove over the victims they became trapped between the roadway and underside of the vehicle mostly by the clothes becoming caught up.
