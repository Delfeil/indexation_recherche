In this paper we present the unusual case of a fistula after implantation of a total hip prothesis. In a 75-year old woman with a fracture of the thigh bone, we observed a paraproctic fistula 42 months after implantation of a total hip prosthesis. To our knowledge there have been no such cases reported with this complication. Thus, we wound like to demonstrate the progress of the illness, the first symptoms, and the kind and success of the treatment.
