Abstract.  A 50-year-old male patient suffering from renal failure was maintained in a stable condition by means of dialysis for 6 years. Hyperkeratotic papules appeared on his extremities. Histological investigation confirmed the diagnosis of perforating collagen disease. The dermatoses that are characterized by transepithelial elimination and associated with renal failure are discussed. The authors consider that the acquired perforating dermatoses should be regarded as a single entity.
