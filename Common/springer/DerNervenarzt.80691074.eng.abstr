Almost all patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experience symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation during the course of the illness. These symptoms can develop  years before death and may severely affect quality of life. Non-invasive intermittent home mechanical ventilation (HMV) via mask is a possible palliative measure for  these symptoms, which is not often used in  Germany. We report on our experience with HMV in 24 patients with ALS. Our data show a good palliative effect in 17 of 24 treated patients. Severe complications did not occur. The mean ventilation time at present is  14 months. Available options and their  consequences need to be discussed in detail with patients and relatives before HMV is  initiated.
