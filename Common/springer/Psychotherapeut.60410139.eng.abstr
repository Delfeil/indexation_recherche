Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy (research). This review starts with a definition of central concepts and hypotheses of this theory and summarizes results regarding the development as well as correlates of attachment, mainly from research in developmental psychology. Related to adults, attachment theory has to be reconceptualized which is done in another part of this paper. Finally, some common methods for the assessment of adult attachment are described which play an important role in clinical studies (these will be the content of the part 2 of this review).
