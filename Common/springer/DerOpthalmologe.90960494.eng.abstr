Lid-loading with precious metals, described by Illig in 1958, has become increasingly important. Because of its good functional and cosmetic results this method is superior to tarsorrhaphy. Furthermore, lid-loading can be combined with additional surgical techniques to achieve more dynamic lid-closure. In a prospective study we examined the results after lid-loading and discuss postoperative changes of the cornea.
