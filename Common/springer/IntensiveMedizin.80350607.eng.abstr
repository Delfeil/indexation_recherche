 The aim of this prospective study was to assess the clinical and prognostic relevance of patent foramen ovale - in contrast to risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources - in 208 patients with cerebral ischemic events. All patients underwent neurological examination (Doppler, CT, NMR) as well as transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. A patent foramen ovale was found in 75 patients (36%). With regard to risk factors for atherosclerosis patients with closed resp. patent foramen ovale revealed significant differencies for age, hypertension, diabetes and use of oral contraceptives. Cardioembolic sources showed significant differencies for atrial fibrillation and atrial septal aneurysm. Multivariate analysis of risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources revealed hypertension and diabetes as age dependant risk factors in patients with closed foramen ovale. In patients with patent foramen ovale the use of oral contraceptives was found as an independant risk factor for cerebral ischemic event. Patients >60 years with cerebral ischemic events had more often a closed foramen ovale. Dependant on age patients with closed foramen ovale showed a higher frequency of hypertension and diabetes. In addition these patients revealed more often atrial fibrillation. Patients with patent foramen ovale had fewer risk factors for atherosclerosis or cardioembolic sources but presented more frequent the use of oral contraceptives or atrial septal aneurysm.
