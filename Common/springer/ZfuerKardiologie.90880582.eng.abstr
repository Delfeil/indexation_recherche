 In a prospective, randomized study of patients with acute manifestation of coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol >=130<=250mg/dl), we compared the effect of an early-initiated, intensified therapy to usual care antilipidemic therapy with respect to coronary lesions and clinical events. Patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and/or PTCA because of severe/instable angina pectoris. The intensified therapy consisted of pravastatin 20-40mg with addition of colestyramine and/or nicotinic acid, if necessary, to achieve an LDL cholesterol <=130mg/dl. In the control group, antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician.
