Eight patients with post-traumatic chronic cervical syndrome and degenerative changes of the upper cervical spine, were treated with suboccipital fusion. After a mean follow up of 60 months (58-64), the patients were examined. Three patients had died during the follow-up period. A solid fusion was achieved in all cases. Significant reduction of pain and increased quality of life were established.
