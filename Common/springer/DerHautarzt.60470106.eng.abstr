In spite of its high incidence, not much is known about the etiology of chronic urticaria. We performed gastroscopic evaluation of 10 patients in whom no cause for chronic urticaria had been found. In 8 of these 10 patients, Helicobacter pylori was identified in the gastric mucosa. The chronic urticarial lesions disappeared within a few days after starting therapy with amoxicillin and omeprazol.
