  Patients with 2nd or 3rd degree AV-block and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could be suitable for VDDR pacemakers, if they are not or rarely paced in the atrium. We studied in 23 of these patients 1 month after DDDR pacemaker implantation, how often they were paced in the atrium with usual pacemaker programmings; patients with < 10% atrial pacing were compared with patients with >= 10 % atrial pacing. In case automatic mode switch was programmed on, the number of mode switch episodes was assessed as a marker for the frequency of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Atrial pacing < 10 % of the time occurred in seven, pacing from 10 to 19 % in six, from 20 to 29 % in two, and >= 30 % of the time in eight patients. Five of the seven patients with < 10 % atrial pacing were paced in the DDD mode, but only four of 16 patients with >= 10 %. Usual clinical findings were unable to predict patients with rare atrial pacing. Patients with < 10 % as well as with >= 10 % atrial pacing had < 10 mode switch episodes in 67 % each. Conclusions: During short-term follow-up after DDDR pacemaker implantation 30 % of the patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and second or third degree AV-block, with present usual pacemaker programmings, rarely had atrial pacing, that means < 10 % of the time. These patients would be probably suitable for VDDR pacemakers. Rare atrial pacing had no influence on the occurrence of automatic mode switch episodes.
