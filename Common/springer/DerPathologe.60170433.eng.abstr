We looked for micrometastases in the axillary lymph nodes of 163 women with breast carcinoma, using monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibodies. We found 26 micrometastases (2.1 %) in node-negative patients (n = 17). Life-table analysis after 3 years detected the conformity of this group with the N1 group with regard to overall survival and distant-metastasis-free survival.
