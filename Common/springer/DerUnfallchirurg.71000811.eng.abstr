Quality management in early clinical care of patients with multiple injuries (description of actual process, identification of problems, implementation of quality improvement) is not possible without sufficient baseline data about the present situation of medical treatment. This study investigates whether the current documentation of treatment in the emergency room is appropriate to judge upon the quality of the process and to detect problems. In addition, a set of baseline data is presented. The performance in the treatment of 126 multiple injured patients was prospectively recorded from 1988 to 1993 and compared with an idealized process based upon an algorithm. The quality of present data recording was analysed, and criteria for judgement of quality of care were assessed. The algorithm was devided into 117 possible steps (one step consisting of a single decision criterion, the decision and the corresponding procedure). Per patient, only 61 %  +/-  12 % of these steps were sufficiently documented to allow judgement. Using several criteria for assessment, the following baseline data could be observed (times shown refer to admission to the trauma room): (1) trauma room time of 129  +/-  55 min; (2) completition of basic radiological and sonographic diagnostics in 91 % of patients; (3) first blood collection after 17  +/-  11 min; (4) cranial computerised tomography after 55  +/-  20 min; (5) missed injuries during the trauma room period in 32 % of patients; (6) intubation after 20  +/-  19 min; (7) insertion of a chest tube after 30  +/-  17 min; (8) first blood transfusion in shock after 32  +/-  17 min; (9) transfused blood within the first hour of 4.2  +/-  2.8 units and within the second hour of 8.5  +/-  4.7 units; (10) emergency operations in shock after 98  +/-  55 min; (11) early operations after 156  +/-  69 min; (12) craniotomy after 124  +/-  37 min; (13) unplanned surgery within 24 hours after admission to the intensive care unit in 11 % of patients. The study presented here supplies information on timing and other process data of the acute clinical care of seriously injured patients. In particular, the data represent indicators for the quality of emergency room management, which may be used as a baseline to compose improvement measures of structure and process. The quality of data collection has to be improved for carrying out an exact analysis of the process.
