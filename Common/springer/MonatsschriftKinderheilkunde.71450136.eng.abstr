Methods: Cases of invasive HI-infections were reported in a national active surveillance program. The case definition required the typical clinical picture and a HI positive culture from a physiologically sterile site (or throat swab or tracheal aspirate in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia) in children up to 10 years. All initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status, type of vaccine, therapy, outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria. The relation between the type of Hib vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame. Results: 310 confirmed cases of invasive HI infections were reported during the observation period, 199 of these with meningitis, 56 with epiglottitis. The number of cases declined from 71 in the last six months of 1992, 120 in 1993, and 65 in 1994 to 54 cases in 1995. In 1995 the incidence in up to 5 year old children was 1.1/100 000 for all infection sites and 0.7/100 000 for meningitis. The reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of unvaccinated cases, whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children fluctuated between 22 and 36 per year. Most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children, who according to the German recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection. The type of vaccine (HbOC, PRP-D or OMP) was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children. 10 % of the bacteria produced betalactamase. In accordance with the German recommendations third generation cephalosporines were used in almost all cases of meningitis. One third of these, however, received additional antibiotics. Conclusions: The present incidence of systemic HI infections in Germany is low. A further decrease, however, would be possible with "on time" completion of the vaccination schedule according to the German recommendations in all children.
