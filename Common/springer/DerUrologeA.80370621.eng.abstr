We analyzed 33 patients with disseminated germ cell tumors (GCT) who underwent residual tumor resection (RTR) during the period from 1991-1997. The patients were markerpositive prior to surgery were analyzed. The histopathological examination of the resected masses, the marker dynamics and the relapse-free respectively the progressionfree survival, were evaluated. The status differed at primary diagnosis: minimal disease n = 1, moderate disease n = 15, advanced disease n = 17. The patients received at average 8,5 cisplatin-containing cycles of polychemotherapy. Only 11 patients underwent surgery after first-line-chemotherapy. The remaining received second- or third-line-chemotherapy prior to surgery. In 12 of 31 evaluable patients, a durable CR was achieved. The median follow-up for this group is 30 months (2-58 months). The histopathologic examination of the resected specimen and the tumor marker level prior to RTR do not permit determination of prognostic outcome. After operation 44 % of the AFP-positive and 30 % of the  -HCG-positive patients had a durable remission. If tumor marker levels at time of RTR are within normal range, disease-free survival is 72 %; in case of elevated markers 39 % will survive. If intensive chemotherapy fails to normalize markers, RTR remains the only option to change the fatal course of the disease.
