Most conditions of the frontal sinus requiring surgery can now be managed successfully by endonasal procedures. To date there has been no clear position regarding indications and results of different types of endonasal frontal sinus drainage. In a retrospective study we evaluated long-term results of Draf's type II and III endonasal frontal sinus drainages using endoscopy and computed tomography. Twelve to 98 months following type II drainage, 58% of 83 frontal sinuses were ventilated and normal. A ventilated frontal sinus but with hyperplastic mucosa was seen in 12%. Scarred occlusion with total opacification on CT occurred in 14%. Furthermore, total opacification in 16% was due to recurrent polyposis. Patients were free of symptoms or had only minor problems in 79%. Twelve to 89 months following type III drainage, 59% of 81 frontal sinuses were ventilated and normal. A ventilated frontal sinus with hyperplastic mucosa was seen in 17%. Scarred occlusion with total opacification on CT was present in 7%. Furthermore, total opacification in 16% was due to recurrent polyposis. In all, 95% of the patients were free of symptoms or had only minor problems. Combining our results with those of other authors and utilizing the physiology of wound healing after sinus surgery, we developed a protocol of differential indications for endonasal frontal sinus drainage.
