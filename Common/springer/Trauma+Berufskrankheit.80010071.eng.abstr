Complete dislocated fractures of the thoracic spine may have no neurological deficits if separation is present in the middle of the dorsal column. In this case there is no injury to the spinal cord, because the "saving fracture" of the vertebral arc prevents it. One case of a severe dislocated fracture at T11-12 is reported. In practice, a complete set of X-rays should be done after high-speed trauma, even if no neurological deficit is present. The treatment is operative by open reduction and fusion from the ventral or dorsal column.
