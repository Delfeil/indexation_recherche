 There is a significantly higher incidence of cerebral ischemia among patients with an atrial septal aneurysm and/or a patent foramen ovale. According to the information provided by modern diagnostic procedures - and in particular by transesophageal echocardiography - two pathogenic mechanisms should be considered as possible causes of the cerebral ischemia. Thrombi may develop locally in the left atrium or atrial septal aneurysm and lead to embolization or, alternatively, thrombi from the inflow region of the inferior vena cava may become trapped in the atrial septal aneurysm and pass through the patent foramen ovale to bring about embolization in the arterial bloodstream. Current treatment consists of life-long anticoagulation with cumarin derivatives in order to prevent further neurological complications. With this treatment, however, the risk of producing hemorrhages cannot be regarded as trivial, especially in old people.
