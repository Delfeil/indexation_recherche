 In a standard questionnaire distributed nationwide, we questioned staff from 1307 clinics (surgical, trauma-surgical, orthopedic), of which 787 clinics (60.2 %) answered by letter. In 698 clinics (88.7 %), operation is considered the standard therapy. Seventy-five clinics (9.5 %) use both conservative and operative therapy (average postoperative rate of complication 3.5 %). Only 14 hospitals (1.8 %) treat strictly conservatively. The average rate of reruptures is 1.6 % in the operated group (77.7 % postoperative plaster cast fixation) regardless of postoperative treatment; the conservative group (96.1 % functional treatment) showed 2.7 % reruptures. Thus, operation is the standard therapy for fresh ruptures of the Achilles tendon in Germany. However, there seems to be a trend towards conservative functional therapy.
