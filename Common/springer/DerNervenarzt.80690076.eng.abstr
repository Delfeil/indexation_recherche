A report is given about a 57-year-old woman with a major depression, melancholic subtype. While under amitriptyline 75 mg/day no adverse effects were observed, immediately after increasing the dosage to 150 mg/day "head spasms" with headache, profuse sweating and arterial hypertension appeared. The diagnosis of a pheochromcytoma was made and adrenalectomy was performed. This is the first case of unmasking a pheochromcytoma by amitriptyline; furthermore a connexion was found with the daily dosage of the antidepressant.
