Basal cell carcinoma is the most frequent skin tumor in humans. It is mostly located in the face and its incidence is steadily rising. The tumor develops from basal, undifferentiated epithelial cells of the skin and its appendices and shows locally destroying growth, but generally without metastatic outspread typical of carcinomas of other origin. The tumor does not occur on the vermilion border of the lips and in the mucosa. Surgery is the most widespread and accepted treatment of basaliomas. It gives the possibility of histologic diagnosis of the whole specimen including margins of resection and allows immediate closure of the defect by means of plastic surgical methods. Regarding aesthetic and functional demands of the region, maxillofacial surgeons have the best prerequisites for this treatment. Recent research results clearly demonstrate the role of UVB light in the etiology, which is modified or promoted by genetic factors. Because of its typical malignant properties, such as progressive growth and infiltration, the term "basalioma", which is mostly used in German, should be replaced by "basal cell carcinoma" as it is known in the international literature.
