A 23-year-old patient suffered from episodic angioedema of the face and neck, accompanied by diarrhea and abdominal pain. Additionally, the patient had bronchial asthma, recurrent nasal polyps and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Blood examination revealed leucocytosis with eosinophilia. Histological studies showed eosinophilic infiltrates in the skin and the gastrointestinal mucosa. Allergic food reactions and parasites were ruled out. With systemic corticosteroid treatment, the clinical symptoms and the eosinophilia disappeared. This case shows some parallels to previously described syndromes (eosinophilic gastroenteritis, Samter's syndrome, episodic angioedema with eosinophilia), but to the best of our knowledge this combination of symptoms has not yet been reported.
