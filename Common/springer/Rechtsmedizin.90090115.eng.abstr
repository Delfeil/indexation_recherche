 Autopsy techniques in the orofacial area are the same as in general forensic pathology. In cases of mass disasters the optimal situation for this type of examination is after removal of the jaws. The methods of maceration used so far seem to be imperfect (toxic, offensive smell, difficult disposal). The use of an enzyme for maceration accelerates the catalytic process enormously and the method is cheap, easy to handle, non-toxic and disposal is simple.
