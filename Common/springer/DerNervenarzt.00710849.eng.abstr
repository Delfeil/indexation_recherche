Oxcarbazepine (OXC; 10,11-dihydro-10-oxo-5H-dibenz-[b,f]azepin-5-carboxamid, trade name Trileptal) is a new antiepileptic drug for treatment of mono- and adjunctive therapy of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization for adults and children above 6 years of age. It was developed through structural variation of carbamazepine. Extensive postmarketing use includes more than 200,000 patient years. The mechanism of action mainly involves blockage of sodium currents. The recommended daily starting dose of oxcarbazepine for both mono- and adjunctive treatment is 8-10 mg/kg (600 mg/day for adults) in two doses and can be titrated according to clinical benefit up to 2400 mg/day. Oxcarbazepine undergoes reductive metabolism at its keto moiety to form MHD, which is glucuronidated and excreted in the urine, with minimal involvement of the hepatic cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes. Thus, OXC has limited drug interactions and does not require slow titration, allowing for better tolerability. Oxcarbazepine compares favorably to presently available new anticonvulsants of the second generation for two reasons: it is available immediately for both mono-and adjunctive therapy in adults and children, and extensive postmarketing experience from many countries is already available. In addition, OXC has been thoroughly tested in an unusually large clinical development program and been shown to be similarly effective as standard antiepileptic drugs.
