 Diffuse fasciitis (DF) [diffuse fasciitis with eosinophilia - Shulman's syndrome] has occasionally been linked to a precedent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Here, we report on another case of DF in a 25 year old male, in whom Borrelia burgdorferi infection as possible inciting agent could be identified based on the patient's history and laboratory data. Efforts to microscopically demonstrate spirochetes or to amplify Borrelia-DNA by nested PCR in lesional tissue failed after antibiotic treatment had already been initiated.
