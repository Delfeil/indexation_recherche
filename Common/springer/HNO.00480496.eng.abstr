Beta-trace protein is a lipocalin that was recently identified as prostaglandin D synthase and represents a major constituent of human cerebrospinal fluid. Beta-trace protein, similar to 2-transferrin, has been used as an immunological marker for the detection of cerebrospinal fluid. Between 1982 and 1999, 130 specimens from 101 patients with suspected cerebrospinal fluid leaks of the anterior or lateral skull base have been investigated for beta-trace protein. The specimens were analyzed by one-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis using Laurrell's electroimmunoassay. In all, beta-trace protein could be detected in 57 specimens and was absent in 73. All case notes were studied retrospectively. In correlation with the clinical course and the findings of CT of the paranasal sinuses, high resolution CT of the petrous bones, CT cisternography, NMR, 111In-DTPA radionuclide cisternography, intraoperative findings, visualization of sodium-fluorescein stained cerebrospinal fluid using endoscopic blue light or testing for glucose, there was no false-positive result. A false-negative result occurred in two cases. These findings show that the beta-trace test has a sensitivity of 97.3% and a specificity of nearly 100%. Our findings show that analysis of beta-trace protein can be a valuable test for detecting CSF leakage and has certain advantages in comparison with the 2-transferrin assay.
