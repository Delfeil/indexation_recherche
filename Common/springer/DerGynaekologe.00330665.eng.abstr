Uterine bleeding disorders may cause diagnostic intrauterine interventions such as hysteroscopy and curettage or therapeutic procedures such as hysteroscopic polypectomy, myomectomy, or endometrial ablation. Hysteroscopic myoma resection has excellent results, as the bleeding pathology is directly correlated with the submucous location of uterine leiomyomata.
