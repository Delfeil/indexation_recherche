 Arteriovenous fistulas of the portal system are rare. Congenital fistulas have to be differentiated from acquired fistulas; the latter are of posttraumatic or iatrogenic origin.

After diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties, the definitive treatment consisted in resection of the fistula system including the pancreatic tail.
