The sensitivity of ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter ECG) for detecting ischaemia is relatively low. A case report of an inferior infarction missed by three-lead Holter monitoring that included a modified lead aVF especially places its sensitivity for detecting inferior ischaemia and infarction in question. Therefore, the present study evaluated the sensitivity of nine bipolar Holter leads for detecting isolated inferior Q-wave infarctions, and compared the sensitivity of the modified leads II, III, and aVF of the Holter ECG with the sensitivity of the "corresponding" leads of the standard ECG.
