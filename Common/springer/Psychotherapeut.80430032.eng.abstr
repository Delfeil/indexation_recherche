Psychotherapy research tends to ignore the value orientations of therapists, patients and psychotherapy schools in favour of a general effectivity factor. This expresses in itself a specifically utilitarian value system and leads sometimes to open but mainly to hidden  arguments. The conflicts between different psychotherapy schools can be better understood, when their different value orientations are clarified and there is a chance to talk about the more obscure areas in the discussion about the "right psychotherapie". The ideas of the philosopher Charles Taylor (1994) in the field of modern identity have been used to help analyse and clarify the values of the various psychotherapy concepts.
