Background. The high standard of hygiene required in using contact lenses requires regular sterilization, for which the application of a hydrogen peroxide system or storage in liquids containing antimicrobial agents are regarded as the most effective procedures. An approach to avoiding contamination could be to provide the lenses themselves with antimicrobial properties. For this purpose contact lenses equipped with a silver layer were examined for their effect on bacteria.
