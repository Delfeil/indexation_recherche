 The therapy of limb-threatening ischaemia is still a matter of controversy . The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether the transcutaneous approach is an alternative to open surgery. We investigated and compared surgical and percutaneous interventional methods in the treatment of both embolic and thrombotic vascular occlusions in patients with pre-existing arteriosclerotic disease with the aim of establishingtherapy guidelines for the therapy of acute limb ischaemia. From 1994 to 1997, a total of 197 patients with acute limb ischaemia were treated. Of 80 patients with embolic occlusions, 23 (28.8%) were treated using percutaneous interventional methods, while the remaining 57 (71.2%) underwent surgery. There was no significant difference in the rate of limb salvage between the groups treated using the transcutaneous approach (86%) and open surgery (88%). In 117 patients with thrombotic occlusions and pre-existing arteriovascular disease, percutaneous treatment was successful in 61% of the 38 patients selected for percutaneous treatment and in 62% of patients undergoing surgery. Another 26 patients underwent additional interventional measures intraoperatively. The rate of limb salvage was 62% for the surgical group as a whole. Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy represents a viable therapeutic alternative to surgical or surgical-interventional modalities, particularly in those patients with occlusions consisting of soft, embolic material and in those with occlusions occurring in infrapopliteal vessels. An interdisciplinary approach to defining the indications for each of these methods should be taken based on the individual patient's clinical and angiographic findings. Additional intraoperative endovascular procedures increase the range of therapeutic options and permit optimal revascularization of vessels both proximal and distal to the site of occlusion.
