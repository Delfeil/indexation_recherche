Clear cell acanthoma is a rare, slow-growing benign epidermal tumour of adulthood. The predilection site of this usually solitary lesion is the distal part of the leg. Multiple clear cell acanthomas are very rare and are also found in other locations besides the typical site of predilection. In this paper we report on a 52-year-old man who - over a period of more than 20 years - had developed more than 100 of these tumours in all parts of his body. Although the histological diagnosis is easy, clinical recognition often proves difficult, especially in cases of multiple lesions. Different kinds of therapy for solitary and multiple lesions are discussed.
