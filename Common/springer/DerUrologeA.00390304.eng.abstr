Chemoprevention of prostate cancer is the administration of agents to prevent, inhibit, or delay progression of prostate cancer. Asian men have a much lower incidence of prostate cancer than men in Europe or the USA. Asian food includes low-fat, high-fiber diets, which provide a rich supply of weak dietary estrogens. These estrogens have been proposed as chemopreventive agents. In addition to their estrogenic activity, many of these plant compounds can interfere with steroid metabolism and bioavailability and can also inhibit enzymes, such as tyrosine kinase or topoisomerase, which are important for cellular proliferation. In addition, nutritional factors such as reduced fat intake, vitamin E, vitamin D, and selenium may have a protective effect against prostate cancer. The fact was proven in large epidemiological studies as well as experimental observations. In the animal model, the progression of established tumors can be inhibited by these agents.
