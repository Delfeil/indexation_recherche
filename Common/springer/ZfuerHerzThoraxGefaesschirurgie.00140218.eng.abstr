 Intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis. Although most lesions are initially detected by echocardiography, additional imaging studies, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging and electron beam computed tomography, are commonly requested. Features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed.
