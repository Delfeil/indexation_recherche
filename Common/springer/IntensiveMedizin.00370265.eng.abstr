 Acute pulmonary embolism is still a challenging field in clinical practice. In the recently published MAPPET study the traditional diagnostic approach using ventilation-perfusion scanning followed by pulmonary angiography was replaced by a more flexible algorithm focusing on transthoracic echocardiography in the majority of cases. Moreover, helical computed tomography has gained importance in the diagnostic confirmation of acute pulmonary embolism. Treatment options are still based on clinical stages. For hemodynamically stable patients anticoagulation is adequate as first line therapy. However, as evident from the MAPPET registry even normotensive patients at presentation with echocardiographic signs of right ventricular dysfunction significantly benefit from primary fibrinolytic therapy. Additionally, the MAPPET registry outlines risk factors for increased in-hospital mortality of acute pulmonary embolism, i.e., syncope, hypotension, history of congestive heart failure, and chronic pulmonary disease. Overall, according to the MAPPET data it seems evident that fibrinolytic therapy lowers mortality in patients younger than 65 years and, even in cardiogenic shock, catheter fragmentation or surgical embolectomy can be avoided in most cases with fibrinolytic treatment strategies.
