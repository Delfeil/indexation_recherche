While health-related quality of life of adults is increasingly researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed. The present paper analyses published articles on children's health-related quality of life, identified from medical and psychological sources according to focus and methodology in research. The review shows that empirical work is short and describes available instruments for the assessment of quality of life in children. Increased research activities are necessary to include quality of life assessment of children in prevention, public health, treatment evaluation and rehabilitation.
