 The assessment of health related quality of life is increasingly accepted in medicine. Health related quality of life can be viewed as self-report relating to psychological, social, physical and every day life components of well-being and function as perceived by the person. To measure health related quality of life several assessment instruments have been developed and psychometrically tested, are available internationally. One of those instruments is the originally American SF-36 which assesses with 36 items eigth dimensions of subjective health as well as two summary scores (a short form with 12 items, the SF-12, exists, too). The instrument was translated into several languages, psychometrically tested and normed in more than ten countries, also in Germany. Translating and psychometric testing of the German SF-36 complied with the international guidelines (IQOLA-Group). In several healthy and ill population excellent psychometric properties concerning reliability, validity and sensitivity were found. In the meantime international work with the SF-36 has proceeded, also in Germany the instrument is frequently used. Currently a health economical derivate of the SF-36, the SF-6D, originally developed in England, as well as computerized applications, computer adaptive testing and evaluation of the item relevance in comparison to other health related quality of life instruments are being performed. The SF-36 is one of the most prominent instrument to assess health related quality of life, even though it has been criticised for focussing on functional conceptualizations of quality of life. The coming years will show which role the SF-36 plays in comparison to other instruments in assessing health related quality of life in medicine.
