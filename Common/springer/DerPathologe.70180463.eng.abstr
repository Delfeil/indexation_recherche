We report a rare case of psammocarcinoma which presented as a mass in the lower abdomen of an otherwise asymptomatic woman. Ultrasonographically, the tumor showed extensive calcification and was suspected to be a myoma. DNA image cytometry and assessment of proliferative activitity were performed and showed an euploid, low proliferating tumor cell population. This underlines the low malignancy of this type of carcinoma, which is comparable to that of serous borderline lesions of the ovary and explains the benign clinical course.
