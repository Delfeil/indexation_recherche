Background: Wegener's granulomatosis is a focal necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis of unknown etiology. It manifests initially as localized inflammation, usually of the lungs, and preceeds to the state of generalisation which can be life-threatening due to renal failure. Ocular and orbital involvement occurs in 28-58% of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. More often, the anterior segments of the eye are involved whereas inflammation of the posterior segments is quite uncommon.
