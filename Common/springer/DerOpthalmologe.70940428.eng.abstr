Photodynamic therapy is based on accumulation of a photosensitizing substance in tissues and excitement by light of a suitable wavelength. Because of high levels of locally absorbed energy this process may also enable the selective destruction of proliferating lens epithelial cells. Delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) is a natural precursor of hemoglobin. An accumulation of porphyrin derivates occurs following ingestion of ALA, of which one, protoporphyrin IX (P IX), is a potent photosensitizer.
