Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma, with UVA possibly playing an important role. Hereditary factors are also relevant. In the dysplastic nevus syndrome a genetic instability has been shown by different methods. In xeroderma pigmentosum the DNA repair defect is thought to be responsible for the high incidence of malignant melanoma. Frequent and non-random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells. These might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes. Especially the short arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one of these genes. This hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas. Changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma, but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known.
