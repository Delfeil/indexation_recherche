Palpable arciform migratory erythema of Clark (PAME) has been described as a rare member in the group of T-cell pseudolymphoma. The clinical picture of infiltrated annular erythema developing into large migrating lesions with the trunk as predilection site is distinctive from other pseudolymphomas. Because of the very similar histology and immunohistochemistry in comparison to the more frequent lymphocytic infiltration of the skin of Jessner and Kanof (LIS) doubts have been raised about the existence of PAME as an unique entity. A 46-year old patient presented with the typical picture of PAME on his trunk while showing typical lesions of LIS on his neck and face. Both diseases showed synchronous intermittent remissions in response to different therapeutic modalities. Multiple biopsies were subsequently performed and histological, immunohistochemical and molecular biological examinations did not reveal relevant differences between PAME and LIS in this patient. We conclude that the findings in this key case suggest that the T-cell pseudolymphoma PAME is not an unique entity, but a special clinical presentation of LIS.
