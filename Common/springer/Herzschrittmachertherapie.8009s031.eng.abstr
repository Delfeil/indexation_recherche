 Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in humans, with a prevalence of 2% to 4% after the age of 60. Anticoagulation therapy has proven effective to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this arrhythmia. Symptoms vary widely among patients and respond unpredictably to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Strategies alternative to drug treatment include radiofrequency catheter ablation, implantable atrial defibrillator, and surgical "maze" atrial compartmentalization.  The implantable atrial defibrillator is presently being investigated as a potential tool, although its clinical applicability remains questionable. Surgical compartmentalization has proven effective to cure atrial fibrillation of the permanent and the paroxysmal type; however, due to its invasivness, this procedure is indicated in very selected cases and performed in few centers.  The objective catheter ablation for the therapy of atrial fibrillation is twofold: 1) the reduction and regularization of heart rate; and 2) the primary treatment of the electroanatomical substrate generating and sustaining atrial fibrillation. The former objective is achieved through radiofrequency-induced "modification" or permanent interruption (together with pacemaker implantation) of the atrioventricular conduction. Clincial improvement in about 80% of cases has been reported with both methods. The primary treatment of atrial fibrillation has been recently proposed based on a replication of the surgical compartmentalization model using catheter techniques. Preliminary results show that the technique is feasible, although its effectiveness must be improved. Possible applications of this technique are facilitated by the recent introduction of a nonfluoroscopic computer-assisted mapping techniques allowing three-dimensional electroanatomical reconstruction of the target chamber.
