The aim of the following study was to develop an osteoporotic model by means of ovariectomy. Bone mineral density of the upper and lower jaw was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DPX) before and after ovariectomy. Histomorphometric measurements were done by a microtomography system. Bone mineral density decreased significantly after ovariectomy in the upper and lower jaw.
