 The article deals with the case of an inflammatory pseudotumour of the lung in conjunction with histoplasmosis of the hilar lymph glands in a 35-year-old immunocompetent woman in a non-endemic area. She had been suffering from headaches and painful swelling of the lower legs, reddening and hyperthermia for 1.5 years. In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms she also complained of a typical flush syndrome which had begun a year later. The main paraclinical finding was a round mass in the right lung in chest radiography. After considering various differential diagnostic possibilities, thoracotomy and resection of the upper lobe of the right lung were performed. The histological diagnosis of the material removed was that of an inflammatory pseudotumour of the lung, combined with histoplasmosis of the hilar lymph glands. Following a postoperative period without complications, antimycotic treatment was performed. The discussion includes whether the simultaneous occurrence of these two diseases is coincidental or whether there is a causal relation between the two. The authors also discuss various treatments with reference to the relevant literature.
