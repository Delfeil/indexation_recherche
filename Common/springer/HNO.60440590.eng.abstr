We report an unusual injury of the face caused by the spoke of an automatic telescoping umbrella that come loose when the umbrella was opened. Due to the shot-like force of the spoke, the left nostril, septum and right wall of the nasal cavity were pierced. The part with the joint penetrated into the maxillary antrum. In order to remove the spoke, wire scissors had to be used to cuff off the spoke's joint inside the surgically opened maxillary sinus.
