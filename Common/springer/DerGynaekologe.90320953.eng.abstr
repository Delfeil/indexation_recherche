Malpractice still involves the highest risk of being found liable for damages in the obstetrics and gynaecology sector. Awareness of faults that are particularly frequent and involve liability for particularly high damages can help practitioners to avoid them. Following the definition of 'malpractice', the role of directives and standards is briefly discussed. Then the forms of malpractice are presented: errors in diagnosis, faulty therapy, culpable failure to provide adequate information on patients transferred to the care of others, and provision of poor advice; typical faults are explained with reference to clinical examples and/or case reports. Particular attention is paid to grave malpractice with consequent reversal of the burden of proof, which is also illustrated by reference to examples of cases. It is shown that the highest risk of liability for damages after malpractice, with extremely high sums awarded in some cases, applies in the case of obstetrics, primarily as a result of not performing cesarian sections or of performing them too late. Problems of causation are then discussed, particularly in view of the changed legal practice, in cases of cerebral damage suffered by children, of regularly commissioning expert assessments from paediatric neurologists and neonatologists, which can incriminate or exonerate the obstetrician. Attention is drawn to the fact - which is still too tittle known - that even the nonascertainment of urgently required findings can lead to reversal of the burden of proof in the same way as an instance of "grave malpractice".
