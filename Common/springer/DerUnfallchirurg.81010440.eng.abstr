In a series of 1850 consecutive knee arthroscopies between 1991 and 1995, plicasyndrome was diagnosed and resected by arthroscopy in 102 patients (5.5 %). Clinical response was evaluated for 38 of 54 patients with an isolated plicasyndrome by use of a modified Lysholm questionnaire at an average follow-up of 31 months (range, 8-78 months). Excellent or good results were obtained in 90 % of 21 patients without plica-induced lesions of the cartilage (group 1) and poor results in 10 %. Only 64 % of 17 patients with plica-induced lesions of the cartilage (group 2) had excellent or good results. Both groups showed an improvement for range of motion and swelling postoperatively. The mean time for rehabilitation was 3.2. and 1.7 months for patients with and without cartilage lesions, respectively.
