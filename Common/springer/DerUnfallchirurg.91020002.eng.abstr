The traumatic lesion of the cervical cord implies one of the most serious sequale after accident with severe consequences for lifetime. In patients with a relevant injury of the cervical spine in 28 % neurological deficits are seen with an even higher incidence of 44 % in the lower cervical spine. The risk of traumatic cervical cord injury further increases with progressing stenosis of the spinal canal and therefore a second peak of occurrence has to be obsered in the elderly. In the preclinical phase even suspicion of a cervical cord lesion should lead to effective stabilization of the cervical spine and should be removed only after imaged proof of integrity. A high dosage therapy of methylprednisolon should be started as early as possible in every case of spinal cord injury. Diagnostic procedures are including x-rays of the whole spine, CT-scans for clearance of suspicious findings and preoperative planning, image intensifiing under controlled stress for hidden instabilities and MRI for spinal cord injuries without abnormal radiological findings. Aims of operative treatment are consisting of decompression, reduction and stabilization with the aims of protection of the neurogenic structures and to secure intensive care treatment. These objectives can be met sufficiently by a single ventral approach in most instances. Dorsal approaches should be avoided whenever possible leaving the important innervation of the paracervical muscles intact. The postacute phase is marked by loss of systemic control mechanis as a consequence of the spinal shock. The consecutive deficits can be mastered only by treatment under intensive care standards. Respirator therapy is advisable especially for higher plegic lesions. Typical complications are frequent and should be watched for carefully because of the absence of pain sensation. Patients with cervical cord injuries should transferred to specialzed paraplegic units for early rehabilitation as soon as possible since the rate of specific complications like decubital ulcera increases with the days of stay in non-specialized units.
