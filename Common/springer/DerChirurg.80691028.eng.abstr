 Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is generally associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). The disease typically progresses slowly, but ultimately, and leads to cirrhosis, liver failure or bile duct cancer. PSC patients with simultanous ulcerative colitis are also at higher risk for colorectal cancer. At the present time, there is no effective treatment for PSC, although preliminary data show encouraging results after treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. However, there are no data concerning the delay or prevention of progress of the disease with this drug, because follow-up time is not yet long enough. Isolated bile duct strictures should be treated endoscopically. The possible effect of proctocolectomy on the course of PSC is controversial. Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for PSC in its final stage. The 5-year survival rate (89 %) is significantly better than after transplantation for other indications. Patients with ulcerative colitis have to be followed up by lifelong colonoscopy. Although the course of UC after transplantation is mostly asymptomatic, these patients are at higher risk for colorectal cancer.
