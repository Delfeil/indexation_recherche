 In acute coronary syndromes, arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density. The underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear. Among others, increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated. Coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined, using immunohistochemistry (TUNEL test to detect fragmented DNA) and transmission electron microscopy. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate plaque group differences in the cellular composition, to detect and quantify cell death, and to diferentiate between apoptosis and necrosis.
