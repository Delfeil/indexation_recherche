Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is caused by the inability of phagocytes to kill ingested germs by microbicidal reactive oxygen. Especially forms of CGD with retained ability to produce some reactive oxygen sometimes tend to imitate other diseases. An 8-year-old girl with a normal history presented with many symptoms matching those of hypersensitivity pneumonitis like restrictive ventilation disorder, suggestive chest x-ray, a majority of CD8 positive lymphocytes in the broncho-alveolar-lavage fluid (BAL), suggestive histological valuation. Hints for the true underlying disease like neutrophilia and a high anti-Aspergillus-titer could be overlooked easily. The patient was treated with steroids and antibiotics because an infection could not be excluded. The CGD had not been recognised at this time, however. After a significant improvement for a short time the patient experienced a dramatic respiratory deterioration. A lot of Aspergillus could now be found in the BAL. Finally the patient died because of an ARDS and respiratory insufficiency even though signs of the Aspergillus infection improved significantly.  Discussion: Whenever CGD must be considered appropriate diagnostics have to be performed- especially before treatment with steroids.
