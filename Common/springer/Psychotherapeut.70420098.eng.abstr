Violent behaviour is characterized by escalating psychic, interpersonal and social processes that are interrelated by feedback mechanisms. In this paper, the case of a severely traumatized, abused and maltreated 12-yearold boy is presented and relevant pathogenetic identification processes are discussed that predispose to violent and abusive behaviour of the child her/himself towards others. The following factors are described: a lack of empathy within the child's relevant relationships, an archaic distortion of the super-ego, an insecure quality of attachment, intrapsychic and interpersonal boundary disturbances, low level of self-esteem and disturbances in identity formation.
