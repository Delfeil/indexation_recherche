We report the case of a 14 year old girl with migraine without aura who developed severe righttemporal throbbing headache, nausea, vomiting and a complete right 3rd nerve palsy few hours after a cerebral concussion. Cranial imaging procedures including transcranial pulsed Doppler sonography, X-ray, CT, MRI, and MRA, as well as neurophysiological and laboratory evaluation were normal. Ophthalmoplegia decreased on day six and on day ten a complete restitution was observed. During the following two months the patient showed - beside her typical migraine attacks - three further ophthalmoplegic headache episodes with progressive  duration and severity, which were not  influenced by her usually effective oral  medication (domperidone and acetylsalicylic acid). However, using iv. lysinacetylsalicylic acid, prednisolone and sc. sumatriptane  during the initial phase of the third opthalmoplegic attack this migraine episode could be treated sufficiently.
