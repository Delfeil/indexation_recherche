Spindle cell lesions of the prostate and surrounding tissues include mesenchymal and epithelial tumors and tumorlike lesions, such as postoperative spindle cell nodules (PSN) and pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors (PFMT). PSN and PFMT are possibly related fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferations respectively. However, they may be misinterpreted as sarcomas.
