Abstract.  Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, asymptomatic swelling of the lateral sides of the fingers and is seen mainly in young men. The formal pathogenesis is a benign fibromatosis. The causal pathogenesis was until now unclear, although we believe, that exogenic factors are the main reason. Consequently pachydermodactyly has to be considered as a result of compulsion neurosis.
