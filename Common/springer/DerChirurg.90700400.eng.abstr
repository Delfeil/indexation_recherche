 The situation of oncological surgery in Germany was evaluated by sending a questionnaire in January 1998 to 1979 registered surgical clinics. A total of 938 responded and stated that they are involved in that field. In 72 % of the departments oncological surgery adds up to 10-30 % of their overall work. The proportion of oncological surgery correlated to hospital size and is highest in university clinics. Colorectal surgery is 93 % and is the leading topographical field in oncological surgery. 73 % of the hospitals regularly perform gastric tumor surgery. The proportion of hospitals with breast surgery is surprisingly high (45 %). Many hospitals (54.6 %) report neoadjuvant treatment regimens. Together with adjuvant therapy this rate amounts to 85.2 %. The diagnostic spectrum of the hospitals involved in the inquiry is statisfactory. However, the modern possibilities of network and telecommunication are not sufficiently used. A second opinion is required predominantly in their own department or clinic, but not between centers. The surgeon's position concerning the speciality "surgical oncology" is ambivalent: only 35.3 % of the department chiefs support this speciality - and over 90 % of the departments reject the structural independence of "surgical oncology" from "visceral surgery".
