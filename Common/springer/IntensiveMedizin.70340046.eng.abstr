 A 24-year-old type I diabetic suffered from recurrent episodes of severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol/l, respectively) following intoxication with synthetic drugs ("Ecstasy" and "Speed"). Despite poor diabetic control (HbA1c 11.7%) insulin was omitted while drugs were taken. Dancing for hours at a Technoparty without adequate volume replacement preceded his first urgent admission to hospital. The clinical picture disclosed dehydration, tachycardia and abdominal symptoms (peritonism). Clouding of consciousness, agitation and delusions were attributed to drug consumption. Therapy included intravenous fluid replacement, correction of electrolyte disturbances and application of insulin. The clinical courses were unremarkable.
