 Vascular diseases and/or sequelae of various systemic diseases are frequently associated with therapy-resistant soft tissue lesions in the lower extremity. Neurovascular pedicled island flaps without the need for the sacrifice of major vessels offer the possibility to save the lower limb from amputation. The long pedicle allows for a wide, tension-free arc of rotation. Major studies of clinical applications at the critical lower extremity have not been reported yet. 14 patients with chronical ulcerations in problematic areas (e. g. ankle, tibia) underwent definitive reconstruction using this flap. Complications were mostly observed at the donor site. In one patient major amputation was neccessary due to the development of sepsis. In all other cases adequate coverage and limb salvage was achieved. Excellent padding, variable size and the modest nature of the flap enlarges the variety of plastic-reconstructive procedures in the lower extremity.
