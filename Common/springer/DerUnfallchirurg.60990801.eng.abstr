The case of a 36-year-old male patient is reported who fell from 20 m, sustaining injuries to the abdomen and pelvis and fractures of both arms and the left leg as well as erect dislocation of both shoulders (luxatio erecta humeri). The injury on the right was subcoracoid, that on the left subglenoid - a compound dislocation of the humerus head through the axilla. Based on this case and the pertinent literature, the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of this rare injury are discussed. After immediate closed reduction, soft tissue damage, fractures or neurovascular lesions should be operated on as soon as possible.
