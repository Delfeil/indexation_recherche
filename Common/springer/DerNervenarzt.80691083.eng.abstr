Retrospective examination of 44 patients with central pontine and/or extrapontine myelinolysis leads to the conclusion that in early diagnostics cerebral NMR is superior to cCT. T2-weighted images turned out to be the most sensitive parameter. Frequent contrast-medium enhancement early in the course up to 4 weeks after clinical manifestation in 7 patients underlines the pathogenetic idea of an initial transient blood-brain barrier. According to our results, central-pontine myelinolysis (CPM) proof by NMR can be expected after 1 week. During the clinical course, cCT and NMR findings showed no regression. Also no connection was noted between the size of the pontine lesion and the favorable clinical course in 72.2% of the patients, nor was there a correlation with the extent of the neurological symptoms at the crisis of the disease. Altogether, cCT and NMR are irrelevant for the prognosis of cerebral myelinolysis.
