 Intraductal and intraparenchymal hypertension represent the rationale for surgical drainage procedures in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. "Simple" drainage procedures such as longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy according to Partington-Rochelle have to be distinguished from "extended" drainage operations, e. g. the combination of longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy with limited local excision of the pancreatic head. This "extended" drainage procedure according to Frey is just as effective as resective procedures in terms of persistent pain relief and definitive management of pancreatitis-associated complications of adjacent organs, i. e. distal common bile duct and duodenal stenosis. This operation also addresses an inflammatory mass in the pancreatic head. In contrast to "simple" drainage procedures the Frey operation allows reliable exclusion of pancreatic carcinoma. With low perioperative morbidity and zero mortality the Frey procedure significantly improves quality of life and leads to social and occupational rehabilitation.
