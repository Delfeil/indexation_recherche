Purpose: Heart valve disease combined with left ventricular hypertrophy leads to derangements in cardiac energy metabolism, which can be detected non-invasively by 31P-MR-spectroscopy. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the derangements in cardiac metabolism are reversible after surgical valve replacement.
