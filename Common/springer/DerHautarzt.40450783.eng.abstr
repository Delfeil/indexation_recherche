Abstract.  A 19-year-old male patient with chronic cutaneous leishmaniosis was treated topically with paromomycin sulphate (15%) and methylbenzethonium chloride (12%) in petrolatum album. After application twice daily for two periods of 32 and 44 days the lesions were completely healed. Previous treatment for 9 months with ketoconazole (400 mg/day) together with the topical application of thiabendazole (2.5%) in base had been unsuccessful. No major side effects were observed after paromomycin sulphate application.
