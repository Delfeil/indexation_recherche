 Aneurysms of the upper extremity are rare. We present a case on isolated aneurysms of the brachial artery. A 45-year-old patient received an end-end fashioned Brescia-Cimino fistula (radial artery, cephalic vein) 13 years ago because of end-stage renal disease due to glomerulonephritis. The AV fistula thrombosed 4 months after successful kidney transplantation. The symptom of the aneurysms was compression of the ulnar nerve. The aneurysmatically altered brachial artery was resected and blood flow was reestablished by interpositioning reversed autologous saphenous vein. In our series of kidney transplant patients, this case is unique.
