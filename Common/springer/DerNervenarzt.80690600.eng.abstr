Long-term course of depression appears to be clearly correlated to marital quality and quality of the relationship with spouses. Aim of the present study is the replication of results, indicating that expressed emotion (EE) is an important factor in prediction of relapse in depression. Additionally, the correlation between EE shown by spouses and the severeness of depressive symptomatology as well as the importance of marital quality as seen by patients for relapse are investigated. Results of our study indicate that spouses EE does not predict relapse, and status of EE does not correlate with the extent of depressive symptoms. However, patient self ratings of satisfaction with marital relationship and of perceived criticism are related to relapse frequency. Additionally, discrepant ratings of marital satisfaction given by spouses predict relapse to some extent. Implications for research in affective disorders and clinical practice are discussed.
