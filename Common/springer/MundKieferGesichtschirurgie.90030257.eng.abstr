Originating from plants, the taxoids, in particular docetaxel (Taxotere), represent progress in antitumoral chemotherapy. In addition to their use as palliative treatment they have also proved to be increasingly important for adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In the present nude mouse model the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents against exemplary oral SCC were examined using cell line HNSCC 001. Typical biological properties such as expression of serum tumor markers and treatment-related alteration were reviewed. Intraperitoneal administration of 30 mg docetaxel per kilogram body weight at a time resulted in significant growth inhibition (P < 0.001), however without complete remission. Mean values of relative tumor volume ranged from 95% to 131% in the treated groups as compared to 311% in animals without treatment. Application more frequently than weekly did not result in a significant increase in antitumor activity. From the present experimental study no final conclusion can be drawn regarding weekly docetaxel administration mostly used in clinical phase II trials. Except for SCC, for which values correlated well with tumor volume (r = 0.85 without treatment and r = 0.87 with treatment), on the one hand, and a distinct treatment-related decrease, on the other, the tested tumor markers TPA and TPS proved to be less valuable for screening of treatment and follow-up in this murine model.
