From a global viewpoint, tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases of our time. The situation in Germany, as in most comparable industrialized nations, is stable. The declining trend of previous years continued in 1997, when 11,163 people developed active tuberculosis - an incidence of 13.6/100,000. However, the tuberculosis  problem cannot be restricted to one country, and Germany is particularly affected by trends in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet countries. These countries experienced a marked increase of tuberculosis  cases and resistant strains during recent  years, a tendency which can only be countered by fast, well-aimed and efficient action in the affected areas. The industrialized nations in particular should consider financial and logistic contributions as their duty. Crucial for control of the tuberculosis situation  within each country are registration and  close observation of epidemiological trends, identification of high-risk groups, and continuation of established tuberculosis control measures.
