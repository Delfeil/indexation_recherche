On the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy, and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis. In the early 1980s, a peptide that caused diuresis, natriuresis, and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups. This was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides, followed by the characterisation of the amino-acid sequences of several species. Synthesis of the peptide, cloning of the encoding gene, identification and characterisation of specific receptors, as well as the development of antibodies and radioimmunoassays were rapidly accomplished. Research on the immunohistochemistry of cardiodilatin/atrial natriuretic peptide (CDD/ANP) and the regulation of CDD/ANP gene expression led to detection of the peptide in extra-atrial tissues. Later on, two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). These peptides share structural features with CDD/ANP with regard to their 17-amino-acid-exhibiting loop bridged by a disulfide bond. Another recently discovered peptide is urodilatin (URO), a renal-borne new member of A-type natriuretic peptide. URO was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as CDD/ANP, containing the 17-amino-acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with 4 additional amino acids located at the NH2-terminus of the peptide. Regarding physiological actions, data strongly support a close association between URO and urinary sodium excretion. The application of URO in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to CDD/ANP-99-126. These results were encouraging for the use of URO in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure (ARF) in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of incipient ARF in patients following liver transplantation. Summarising the results of these two studies, URO represents a new approach for not only prevention, but also for treatment of ARF following organ transplantation. This opens up new possibilities for the treatment of ARF of other origins in intensive care medicine.
