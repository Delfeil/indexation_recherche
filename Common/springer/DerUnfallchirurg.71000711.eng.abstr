Enchondroma are benign cartilaginous tumors and are localized most often at the site of the phalanges. Between 1982 and 1993 73 patients with monostotic enchondroma and 5 patients with polyostotic enchondroma were operated at our clinic. Clinical signs of monostotic tumors were pathological fracture (38.4 %), pain or swelling. Eleven percent of cases were accidental findings. Surgical treatment was performed by complete removal of the tumors and filling the bone cavity with autologous spongiosa taken from the pelvic bones, the elbow, or the radius. Three patients (4.1 %) had to be operated a second time due to wound infections and hematoma. In one case Sudeck's dystrophy was diagnosed. One patient (1.4 %) developed a recurrent tumor. Our follow-up examination of 65 patients showed that 77 % of the patients with monostotic enchondroma achieve very good or good functional long-term results after this operation, but only 40 % of the patients with polyostotic enchondroma.
