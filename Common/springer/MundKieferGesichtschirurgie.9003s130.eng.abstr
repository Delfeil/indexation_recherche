Endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects. A retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long-term results. A total of 128 implants were inserted, 110 implants in the periorbital, 12 implants in the mastoid, and six implants in the paranasal region; 113 implants were short craniofacial Brånemark implants, and 15 implants were dental implants. The success rate for implant survival was 94.5%. Long-term results were promising and more than satisfactory, leading to a large indication for these endosteal implants.
