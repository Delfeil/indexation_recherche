Although drug eruptions resembling graft-versus-host disease are rare, GvH-like reactions to the sulfhydryl group of drugs (penicillamine, captopril, gold sodium), phenobarbital and hepatitis vaccine have been described. Clinical reports concerning acute GvH-like drug rash are very uncommon and restricted to acetylsalicylic acid and spironolactone. We report on a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction caused by allopurinol. To our knowledge this variant of cytotoxic drug eruption has not yet been reported in literature.
