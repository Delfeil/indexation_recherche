 The botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst. The origin of the BOC can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue. The BOC is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible, as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between 60 and 70 years. Most of the 11 published articles of BOC have shown high rates of recurrence. Histopathologically the BOC is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin, nonkeratinized epithelium. Clusters of glycogen-rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular thickenings of the cyst lining. For the clinician, the differentiation of the BOC from the keratocyst and ameloblastoma is relevant. One case of a large BOC (65-year-old male, BOC regio 33-45, diameter 5 cm, radiographically and histologically multilocular) is presented with a review of the literature, including the therapeutic management, and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed. The immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin (CK) 13 implicates the histogenetic origin of the BOC from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands. The expression of CK 19 and the lack of expression of p53, as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the BOC, may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst.
