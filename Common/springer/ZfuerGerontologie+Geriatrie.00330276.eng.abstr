 The present study analyses gender-specific risks for women in the second half of their career, especially their labour force participation rate, the degree and quality of their vocational qualification, the risk of becoming unemployed, and their transition to retirement. The analysed data show that women obviously are at higher risks to participate in the labourforce throughout their biography. Therefore, strategies to improve the working conditions of female elderly workers should not only consist of age-specific policies, but of general practices in human resource development.
