  The various pathogenic species of Aspergillus are ubiquitous. In the past, Aspergillus flavus was not been considered to be highly pathogenic in humans. We describe the case of a 72 year old patient whose tracheal culture tested positive for Aspergillus flavus after coronary artery bypass grafting. The indirect hemagglutinations test and the monoclonal latex antibody test had been negative; however, the enzyme immunoassay test was positive. There was no radiological or clinical evidence of systemic infection. The patient died before administration of antimycotic therapy. The autopsy showed disseminated mycosis by Aspergillus flavus of both lungs. Due to its greater sensitivity, enzyme immunoassay testing can make detection of Aspergillus flavus easier. Since Aspergillus flavus is pathogenic in humans, we believe that intravenous antimycotic therapy with Amphotericin B should started immediately if a patient test positive in trachea culture for Aspergillus flavus.
