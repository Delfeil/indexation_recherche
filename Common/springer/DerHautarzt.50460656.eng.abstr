A 58-year-old man presented with a solitary, asymptomatic, firm nodular lesion on his glans. A simple excision was carried out. Follow-up for 1 year failed to reveal either recurrence or metastases. Histologically, there was intradermal proliferation of atypical oval and spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicles simulating the pattern of neural tumours. Mitotic figures were abundant. Stains for melanin, HMB-45 antigen were negative. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells stained for S-100 protein and vimentin. Malignant schwannoma usually occurs in patients with neurofibromatosis and is located in the subcutaneous tissues. Solitary malignant schwannoma of superficial soft tissue is a rare entity, and there are problems of differential diagnosis against other spindle cell tumours, especially malignant spindle cell melanoma. Their appearance on the glans is rare.
