Even today, adequate postoperative analgesia is still a great problem. Based on positive results of former studies using a continuous infusion of tramadol for postoperative pain relief [2, 15], we aimed to improve this regimen. In order to investigate the effectiveness of preventive analgesia, one group of patients was given 100 mg tramadol (Tramal) at the time of extubation, followed by a maintenance infusion. The other group was treated with single boluses of tramadol on demand, thus representing common pain treatment.
