Arthroscopic Bankart repair is performed via an inferior transmuscular approach to reattach the torn labrum-capsule complex with biodegradable extra-articular implants (Suretac). An additional superior labrum or SLAP lesion is refixed with an intra-articular technique. Intra- and postoperative complications after arthroscopic stabilization of 170 patients with traumatic anterior instability or SLAP lesion were analyzed retrospectively. Intraoperative complications included breakage (1) and bending (3) of the guide wire, fracture (2), and loss (2) of implants. In one case, the head of the Suretac cut through the refixed labrum, and in seven cases a bulging out of the glenoid cartilage after implant insertion was seen. Eight patients suffered from a frozen shoulder postoperatively, caused by a foreign body reaction and synovitis, and required revision surgery. No patient with neurologic complications or infections was recorded. Arthroscopic treatment of this pathology is technically demanding and requires an experienced surgical team, as well as the knowledge of all possible complications. The failure rate can be lowered by paying attention to some guidelines (high flexible wires, 8-mm diameter Suretac, fixation steps under visualization). A higher incidence of adverse reactions with synovitis followed by adhesive capsulitis seems to be correlated to the biodegradable material, and isdifficult to avoid.
