Disregarding pain resulting from vitamin deficiency, an analgesic effect seems to be exerted only by vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B6 (pyridoxines), and vitamin B12 (cobalamine), particularly when the three are given in combination. The analgesic effect is attributed to an increased availability and/or effectiveness of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine acting as inhibitory transmitters in the nociceptive system.
