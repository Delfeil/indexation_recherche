Impaired adrenal function during perioperative stress carries the risk of acute cortisol (Cs) deficiency (Addisonian crisis), which may be critical without Cs supplementation. Thus, with evidence of dysfunction of the adrenal glands perioperative substitution is indicated. However, it is unclear whether unilateral adrenalectomy may attenuate the adrenocorticoid response. Glucocorticosteroids are potent agents with several well-known side effects. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if routine Cs supplementation is justified and necessary in patients undergoing adrenalectomy during nephrectomy for renal-cell cancer.
