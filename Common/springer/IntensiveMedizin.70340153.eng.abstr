 Bacterial respiration filters are able to prevent the contamination of anesthetic equipment in inhalation anesthesia. In consequence, no further changes of tubes are required for each patient, and the tubes can be changed daily or at even longer intervals. As a result of an decreased frequency of reprocessing and less damage of the tubing material an economic advantage is obvious. There are no studies indicating a reduction of frequency of pneumonia during mechanical ventilation by bacterial respiration filters. Thus the use of these filters is not recommended in intensive care units. Furthermore, no changes of tubes are recommended every 48 h; they can be changed at least once a week without the use of bacterial respiration filters. This is possible without additional risk for patients to acquire pneumonia and also leads to enormous cost reduction.
