The epidemiology of AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) points to a sexually transmittable disease. Despite the fact that a recently discovered new herpesvirus has been detected in all forms of KS (Aids, classic, african and immunosuppressed - KS) its role remains to be further established, since a simple infection cannot account for all epidemiologic findings in KS. Various cytokines seem to play an important role also. The effect of human chorionic gonadotropin on KS can explain the different incidence of KS in males and females. Whether all forms of KS indeed have common causes, today, seems doubtful.
