Cyclic neutropenia is a rare hematologic disorder of unknown origin. Periodic decreases in blood leukocytes with relative neutropenia and lymphocytosis are typical. These episodes appear in regular intervals of 15-35 days and last three to seven days. They are associated with physical weakness, fever, septic complications and necrosis of mucous membranes. Between the episodes, the patients are in complete clinical and laboratory remission. We report the case of a 34 year-old patient suffering from cyclic neutropenia with ulcerous lesions of the oral mucosa.
