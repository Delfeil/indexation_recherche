A 139/12 year old boy presented with the clinical and laboratory signs of a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like illness. Three months later he developed acute renal failure associated with hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia while being treated with prednisone and a non-steroidal antiphlogistic agent. Kidney biopsy revealed endotheliotropic microangiopathy. A thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome was diagnosed according to clinical and histological findings. Plasma exchange, hemodialysis and immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide resulted in a normalization of the hematologic findings, and the kidney function improved. The cyclophosphamide therapy was continued over 21/2 years. Three years after the acute episode the boy is free of symptoms with glomerular filtration rate of 71 ml/min/1.73 qm.
