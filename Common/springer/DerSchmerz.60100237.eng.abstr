 Problem There is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. The literature on these patients reports that mobility, endurance, trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity. Chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons. Methods Our study group consisted of 90 disabled CLBP patients (44 female, 46 male; average age 42 years) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8-week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support (instruction, endurance training, strength exercises, behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy). Initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons (44 female, 63 male, average age 41 years). The patients were investigated before and after treatment, and at intervals of 6 and 12 months. The reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison. Physical assessment included a medical examination (mainly diagnosis of radicular or nonradicular pain), changes in the lumbar spine revealed by X-ray studies according to Herron and Turner [50], rating of physical impairment according to Waddell [117], flexibility, length of hamstrings muscles (SLR), test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the Swiss group of Spring [102] and isokinetic measurements (LIDO Back), tests of lifting capacity (LIDO Lift), and (in part) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer (CASE 15 Marquette).  Results Physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced SLR (shortened hamstrings) and decreased spinal mobility.  Patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals. The results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group, whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group. In principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines. Cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients. At the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly. In many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group. With time, however, training effects gradually decreased. The success of treatment (return to work, absence from work, pain reduction, use of medical care) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment. Conclusion Study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain. The only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance, in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group. However, even CLBP- patients with long-term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program. Back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy. Because of loss of condition during the time after treatment, regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary. Overall, treatment of CLBP has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results.
