In childhood Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome manifests itself almost only via paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. A 15-year-old boy who had been asymptomatic before suffered from cardiac arrest due to ventricular flutter. After restoration of sinus rhythm, surface electrocardiogram exhibited classical preexcitation pattern. During electrophysiological testing an accessory atrioventricular pathway located at the left posterior wall was found and successfully ablated by radiofrequency current application. Since then the boy is asymptomatic.
