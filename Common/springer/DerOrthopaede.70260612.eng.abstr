Autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the microtopographic anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of microneurosurgical techniques. Recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions. However, attempts to restore forearm, hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far. Therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making, selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and longlasting postoperative management.
