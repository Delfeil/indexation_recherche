Despite the fact that, in Germany, valid laws allowing unrestricted use of iodine salt are available, iodine deficiency still exists. The foetus, newborns and pubertal children are particularly vulnerable to iodine deficiency. The role of the paediatrician is, therefore, an important one not only in guiding patients but also in disseminating knowledge towards the prevention of iodine deficiency. From the results of our survey, approximately 85 % of German paediatricians are of the opinion that iodine supply in children is unsatisfactory. It emerged that 90 % do hold iodine supplements in children to be necessary, whereas 8 % believe that iodine intake poses a risk to health. The high costs arising from goitre were, on the whole, underestimated. It can, therefore, be concluded that, firstly, there is consensus on the fact that iodine intake is low in Germany, and, secondly, that measures must be taken to improve this situation: The education of the public must continue to be given high priority in aiming to achieve increased intake of iodine salt and in allaying the fears of professionals and lay people.
