We investigated 88 Patients with a total of 102 angiographically diagnosed intracranial aneurysms by means of transcranial colour coded Duplex sonography (TCCD) during a time period of 15 months. Both the size and teh localization of teh aneuryms were determined. Seventy aneurysms (77%) with a diameter of 16 +/- 8 mm (6-55mm) were detectable, with excellent visualization in 36 (42%), moderate visualization in 34 (40%), and no sufficient visualization in 16 (16%) aneurysms, respectively. In another 16 cases (16%) there was no sufficient vone window. Thrombotic material inside the aneurysm was detectable in 16/20 cases (75%), visualization of coil embolized aneurysms in 12/25 patients (48%). TCCD allows the follow up of cerebral aneurysms, with the detection of thrombosis and treatment effects after embolization. The method is not valid for the detection of intracranial aneurysms
