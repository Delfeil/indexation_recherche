The experiments described herein permitted the dynamic in vitro measurement of the mechanical efficiency of the quadriceps muscle, both before and after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The measurement of tibiofemoral pressure on fixed and mobile polyethylene inlays, as well as the movement of mobile inlays, is described. The Interax TKA system was implanted in 8 fresh frozen knee cadavers which were then mounted onto a knee-simulating machine. An isokinetic extension motion was simulated by extending the knee specimens under a constant extension torque of 31 Nm.
