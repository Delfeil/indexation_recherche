In a randomized study 30 patients with chronic stationary psoriasis were treated with 3 different topical schemes. Group 1 (n=10) received monotherapy (dithranol (D) twice a day, D/D), group 2 (n=10) calcipotriol mornings/dithranol evenings (calcipotriol (C)/dithranol (D) C/D) and 3 (mometasone (M) mornings/dithranol (D) evenings, M/D). During the therapy period of 4 weeks we documented the PASI-Score as well as infiltration, erythema and desquamation weekly. The M/D group revealed in the first week a significantly faster reduction of the PASI-score (5,3) than in the D/D group (PASI 13,22). The C/D group (PASI 10,5) show a not significantly faster reduction. After 4 weeks of treatment and after a follow period of 6 weeks there were similar PASI-Scores in all groups. There were less side-effects in the M/D group than in the others. The beginning, more anti-psoriatic effectiveness was achieved by the mometasone/dithranol combination than the other schemes. In the long term, the effects were similar.
