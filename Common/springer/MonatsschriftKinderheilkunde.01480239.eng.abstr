We demonstrate the characteristic sonographic features of thrombosis of the vena cerebri magna. Thrombosis of the vena  cerebri magna occurred in a preterm infant with an gestatation age of 33 weeks. Thrombosis resulted in bilateral infarction of the regions drained by deep cerebral veins, including periventricular white matter, thalamus and choroid plexus with intraventricular haemorrhage. The clue for the diagnosis was the sonographic pattern of lesions. The diagnosis was confirmed by duplex-scanning and the non contrast enhanced computed tomography.
