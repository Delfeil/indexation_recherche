Primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias, dysostoses and dysplasias. Hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal. Generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy 21 and Ullrich-Turner syndrome. Dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis. Many of them are caused by mutations of single genes in the cascade of morphogenetic gene sequences. Dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue. Some of them (e. g. achondroplasia, Jansen type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia) are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation. Others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components. Examples are collagenopathies such as osteogenesis imperfecta and some spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias. Finally, disorders such as pycnodysostosis, result from defects of chondro-osseous homeostasis. The study of skeletal defects helps to unravel the complexity of normal skeletal development.
