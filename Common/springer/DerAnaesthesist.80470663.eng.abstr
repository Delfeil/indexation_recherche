In Germany a TCI-system for propofol (Disoprifusor-TCI) has been commercially available since spring 1997. We investigated the prediction error and precision of this TCI system as part of a multicentre study. Bias, precision, blood concentrations and dosage of propofol were compared with patients receiving propofol via a manually controlled infusion device.
