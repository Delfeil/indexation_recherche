Abstract.  We report on a rare case of a solitary subcutaneous metastasis from a chondrosarcoma. The metastasis occurred 7 years after excision of the primary neoplasm. Further investigations revealed no evidence of other metastases. Nevertheless, according to data in the literature, the prognosis has to be considered very poor.
