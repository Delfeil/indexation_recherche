 Ischemic preconditioning (IP), using one or more brief periods of ischemia before a sustained ische- mia, represents a new approach in reducing ischemia-induced skeletal muscle damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IP on skeletal muscle function after 3 h ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in a rodent model. IP protocols using one, two, or three preconditioning cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion each, were compared to non-preconditioned controls. IP was found to significantly improve force, performance, endurance, and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle. The efficacy of IP- induced protection was correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles. Preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles. Altogether, this study describes the efficacy of IP in improving post-ischemic muscle function and the need of more than one IP cycle to achieve this improvement. The respective clinical potential warrants further exploration.
