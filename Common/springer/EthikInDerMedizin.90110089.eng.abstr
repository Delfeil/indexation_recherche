Abstract.  Definition of the problem: In 1997, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) was performed in 138.001 cases in Germany. The standard indications, single vessel disease and badly controlled angina, are more and more extended to multivessel disease with and without severe angina, unstable or preinfarction angina, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) itself. Dilating asymptomatic stenoses of more than 70-80% is a widely used indication, intending prophylaxis of complete occlusion and AMI. Actually there is no generally accepted guideline for the different new indications, conservative versus invasive treatment schedule. It is difficult for the patient to get appropriate information before his decision between mechanical procedures and conservative methods; authentic informed consent actually seems to be in a very bad position. In 1992 the working group called "Arbeitsgemeinschaft leitender kardiologischer Krankenhausärzte (ALKK)" decided to start a registry of all PTCA procedures, in order to gain knowledge about the present status of PTCA in Germany. Up to March 1999, 198.608 PTCA are logged.
