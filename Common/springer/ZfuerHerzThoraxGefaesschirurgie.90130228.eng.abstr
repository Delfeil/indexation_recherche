 Coumarin necrosis is a rare, but life-threatening complication when administering coumarin in oral anticoagulant therapy. Predestined areas are the breasts, hips, gluteal region, thighs or lower legs. Thrombotic tendencies, such as congenital or acquired changes in coagulation, lead to a higher risk of coumarin necrosis. A direct, toxic effect of coumarin on the capillary system may also play a role. Although the incidence is only 0.01-0.1%, lethality lies at 15%, the knowledge of this rare complication is important in order to begin with a proper treatment punctually. The therapy of choice is early fibrinolysis.
