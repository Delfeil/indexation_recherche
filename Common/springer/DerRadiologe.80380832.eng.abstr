Aim: For dynamic contrast medium (CM) studies, parameter images exploit specific features of the time/intensity curve (TIC) of each pixel and represent these values in a new image. Exisiting concepts of two-dimensional CM analysis are extended for three-dimensional applications using adequate computer graphic visualization.
