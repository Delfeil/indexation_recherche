 Given the high prevalence of atrial fibrillation and the lack of effective therapeutic options, the recent suggestion of biatrial or dual site right atrial pacing as a means of preventing atrial tachyarrhythmia has gained major interest. Data presented so far come from interventions in very specific patient groups (for example, from patients with atypical flutter) or from comparisons between the pre- and postimplant course of patients paced for the brady-tachy syndrome by a conventional and dual site atrial approach. Although success rates of 77 up to 91% under an optimum antiarrhythmic drug regimen are promising, there is a lack of sufficiently large randomized trials and a need for insights in the basic mechanisms which make this approach likely to be effective. Based on observations on the spontaneous onset of atrial fibrillation, overdrive pacing and the preexcitation of the (presumably) arrhythmogenic substrate may be valid concepts of arrhythmia prevention.
