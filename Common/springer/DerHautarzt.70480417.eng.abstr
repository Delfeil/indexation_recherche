In hair germ tumors, hair follicle development is partially or completely recapitulated. The trichoblastoma represents a purely epithelial tumour within this group of tumours. We identified a trichoblastoma showing exclusively adenocystic features in a 32 years old woman. This variant has been very rarely described in the literature. We review the history of hair germ tumors and discuss the problems of their classification.
