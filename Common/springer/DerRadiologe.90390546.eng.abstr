In women with breast cancer, staging of the tumor plays an important role and often is considered to be the most prognostic and therapeutic factor. The most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic TNM classification. In recent years conservative therapies such as preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy are used more often with limited tissue evaluation resulting in insufficient or even inaccurate staging data. Tumor size as well as nodal involvement is decisive in selecting a treatment method and assessing the response. Thus, more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary. This article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine) used for breast cancer staging. Furthermore, results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging.
