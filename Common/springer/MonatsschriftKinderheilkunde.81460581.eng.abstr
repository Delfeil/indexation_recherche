Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated. In an asymptomatic 13-year-old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the Aa. iliacae, a combination which so far has not been described, that has not been reported before. The vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic. Angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the Aa. coronariae and Aa. subclaviae. After 13 months of low-density-lipoprotein(LDL)-apheresis angiographically there was no pregression, but even slight improvement of vascular the disease. Discussion: Since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination, we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia. LDL-apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients.
