Introduction: Endoscopic erbium-YAG laser treatment is a new approach in glaucoma surgery. In contrast to conventional laser systems, the photoablative erbium-YAG laser allows microperforations of the trabecular meshwork without thermal side effects. We report our first preclinical trials using this new system.
