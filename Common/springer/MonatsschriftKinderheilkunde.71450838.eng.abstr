The study presents data on birth prevalences of selected congenital malformations in livebirths with residence in Bavaria, born between 1984 and 1991. Cases have been ascertained retrospectively by reviewing hospital records of all children being referred to a Bavarian children's hospital up to two years of age. The calculations of prevalences give rates both of malformed children (child with multiple malformations was counted only once according to his malformation class) and of malformation diagnoses (child with multiple malformations was counted under each of his malformation diagnoses). 8,527 children with isolated malformations and 3,513 children with multiple malformations were included. Boys were more often affected than girls (m:f=1,4:1, without hypospadia). While prevalences of most malformations remained relatively constant between 1984 and 1991, the rate of isolated spina bifida has decreased slightly, whereas the rates of isolated ventricular septal defects and isolated obstructive defects of the urinary tract (ICD9 753.2+753.6) have increased considerably. The Bavarian prevalences were compared with those of the EUROCAT registry.
