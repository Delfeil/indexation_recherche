Aims: The X-ray contrast medium Thorotrast, used worldwide between 1930 to 1950 predominantly for arteriography, consisted of a colloidal solution of thorium dioxide. The radioactive thorium-232 (half-life 1.4x1010 years) is stored lifelong in the organs of the reticulo-endothelial system after intravascular injection, causing chronic exposure to alpha radiation. The aim of the German Thorotrast study is the assessment of radiation late effects and the calculation of risk estimates.
