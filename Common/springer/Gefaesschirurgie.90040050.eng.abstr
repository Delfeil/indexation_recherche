 Armand Trousseau (1801-1867) was the first to recognize that phlegmasia alba is frequently associated with tumour disease. His main work, Clinique médicale de la Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, contains impressive case histories. On the basis of a phlebitis that occurred in his own left arm he diagnosed himself with gastric cancer, and this was in fact the cause of his death. Trousseau is one of the most famous doctors of all time. Numerous discoveries in the area of internal medicine go back to him. Following his tutor, Bretonneau, he introduced the performance of tracheotomy as a routine operation for diphtheritic croup; he also devised the technique of thoracocentesis. He concerned himself particularly with the infectious diseases of the time and with neurology.
