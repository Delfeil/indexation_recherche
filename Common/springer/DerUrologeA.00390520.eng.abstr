Pathogenic aspects of interstitial cystitis (IC) are reviewed on the basis of the current literature applying the criteria of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Three hundred forty-six peer-reviewed publications of the past 30 years were retrieved via MEDLINE employing the key words "interstitial cystitis and pathogenesis or etiology" and classified according to EBM criteria and subject categories. The papers were then reviewed and summarized and are discussed considering the theory of acute and chronic inflammatory responses.
