 After two days of abstinence of prior alcohol abuse, a 48 year old man fell unobserved and was unconscious for a short time. On admission he was reoriented but showed a persisting psychomotoric restlessness. There was no focal neurological deficit, especially no headache nor meningism. Diagnosis of an alcohol withdrawal seizure was made. A CT-scan unexpectedly showed a severe basal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Arteriography revealed an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery which was quickly operated. After surgery the patient recovered completely.
