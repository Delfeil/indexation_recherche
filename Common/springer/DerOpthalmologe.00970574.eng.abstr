Background. Immune recovery of AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis treated and healed by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is reflected by increased CD4 cell count and decreased virus load. Due to partial reconstitution of the immune status the risk of opportunistic infections decreases, as well as the risk of reactivating inactive CMV retinitis. It may therefore be possible to stop anti-CMV maintenance therapy may after HAART-induced immune recovery.
