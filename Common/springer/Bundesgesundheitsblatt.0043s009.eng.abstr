HIV remains infectious at room temperature for about six to twelve hours under sterile conditions, the time is shorter in the presence of bacteria and when clotting occurs.  HIV infectivity is easily destroyed by disinfectants.  The human infectious dose of HIV is around 100 to 1000 particles, dependent on the virus and the site of entry into the host.  After inoculation new HIV is produced after 24 hours, and HIV has spread over the whole organism by the end of one or two weeks.  HIV infection may be detected after four to twelve weeks by antibody assays, and after eleven days by nucleic acid based assays.  Anti-HIV production might be slowed down under initial therapy.
