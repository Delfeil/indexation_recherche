We report about a 71/2 year old girl with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma and Neurofibromatosis Recklinghausen, presenting with myopathy and osteomalacia as the leading symptoms. The severe myopathy and osteomalacia were caused by renal phosphate loss secondary to a chemotherapy induced De Toni-Debre-Fanconi syndrome.
