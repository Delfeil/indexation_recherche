Abstract.  Definition of the problem: Television has developed various forms for the presentation of issues on medical ethics. Our inquiry focuses on the textual, visual and musical elements that are used in two short television features on preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Arguments: We used the method of question-stimulated group discussion to reconstruct how an audience of persons interested in medical ethics perceives which moral problems are presented in the films and how the audience grounds its perceptions on determinate elements of the films. Conclusion: In the enactment of ethical questions in the two selected features there is a salient tendency - pointed out by spontaneous and subjective impressions of the audience - (1) to juxtapose rather than to mediate the presentation of medico-technical progress and the presentation of those who are concerned, (2) to present conflicts in a personally close-up manner that invites identification, (3) to inform about moral problems only by emphasising undesirable consequences. All these observations are connected with specific textual elements, pictures and music and, as a first step of analysis, described with regard to their effect on the viewers.
