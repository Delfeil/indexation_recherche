Abstract.  Iatrogenic bile duct lesions are serious complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and include biliary leakage and major bile duct injury. The incidence of biliary lesions following laparoscopic cholecystectomy is up to threefold higher than that of the open procedure. A total of 108 patients with bile duct lesions after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were treated at our institution. Endoscopic treatment was successful in 68 cases, 6 patients were treated by external drainage, and 34 patients required surgical therapy. Selection criteria for the type of treatment included the etiology, anatomical situation, and diagnostic interval of the biliary lesion. We suggest a classification of bile duct injury and a proposal for diagnosis and treatment of these complications.
