  In transesophageal echocardiography several methods have been used to grade mitral regurgitation. For a direct comparison of these techniques, 36 patients (60  +/-  13 years) with native mitral regurgitation underwent multiplane transesophageal echocardiography and angiography within 5 days. We compared the following measurements: 1) The maximal color jet area of mitral regurgitation, 2) the ratio of maximal systolic to diastolic pulmonary venous flow velocity in the left upper pulmonary vein, 3) the proximal jet width of mitral regurgitation, 4) the maximal regurgitant flow rate Qmax, measured by the proximal convergence method, 5) the regurgitant orifice area Areg, calculated by dividing Qmax by maximal regurgitant velocity obtained by continuous wave Doppler.
