 Adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison's disease) is a functional diagnosis. At the beginning of this century, tuberculosis was recognized as the main etiological cause (50-70 %). Today, however, tuberculosis represents only 10 % of the cases. Adrenocortical insufficiency is mainly caused by autoimmune adrenalitis (more than 50 %). Unilateral adrenocortical disease is usually asymptomatic or presents, as in the case described, with minor symptoms. This case report of adrenal tuberculosis illustrates the current challenges of diagnosis and therapy.
