The diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy syndrome, a subtle form of child abuse, is very difficult. One reason is a seemingly well caring "ideal" mother who is mainly responsible for the fabricated illness of her child, the other biologically and technically well trained medical doctors maltreating the children unwittingly. Doctors are often separated from each other by their subspecialities but nevertheless directly approached by the mothers. The latter frequently have a medical education. A warning list of "red flags" of symptoms and clinical situations should sensitise the pediatrician for artificial illnesses and enable him to start diagnostic work-up early. One responsible doctor should coordinate all activities. The crucial step is a separation of mother and child, but a team approach involving child psychiatry, child wellfare organisations and legal authorities is mandatory. Therapeutic options for the perpetrators are minimal. The prognosis is poor if such a child is not separated from his family or retransferred too early. Research to understand psychopathology and to develop new therapeutic options is needed.
