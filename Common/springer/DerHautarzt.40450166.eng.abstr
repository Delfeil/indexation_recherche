Abstract.  Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease, which can present in various clinical forms. We report on a 73-year-old male patient with the inflammatory type of EBA, which is clinically similar to bullous pemphigoid. Histological examination revealed subepidermal blister formation, and direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin revealed a linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the basement membrane. Indirect immunofluorescence with 0.9% NaCl-separated human skin as substrate showed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the base of the artificial blister at a titre of 1:320. Indirect immunoelectronmicroscopy revealed immune deposits localized in the area of the sublamina densa. Immunoblotting of dermal extracts disclosed binding of serum antibodies to a 290-kDa protein. Systemic therapy with diaminodiphenyl sulphone, initially in combination with corticosteroids, resulted in complete healing of the skin lesions. With reference to this case report, we discuss the clinical pictures possible in EBA, the differential diagnosis and the treatment options.
