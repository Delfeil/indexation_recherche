Near infrared imaging is a non-invasive imaging modality which uses light of a spectral range between 650 and 1000 nm for tissue transillumination. Near infrared photons can penetrate by diffusion into tissue up to several centimeters due to low absorption by intrinsic chromophors (e. g. hemoglobine). During the last years optical mammography has become field of growing interest. Several prototypes of near infrared scanners have been developed for clinical studies in order to obtain transillumination images of the breast. The results indicated, that discrimination of tumors located up to several centimeters below the tissue surface (e. g. breast tumors) from surrounding healthy tissue did not succeed with sufficient specificity. The diagnostic potential of near infrared imaging can be enhanced using dyes as contrast agents. Specially designed cyanine dye derivatives are potential contrast agents because of their suitable optical properties and pharmacokinetic behaviour leading to an increased tumor fluorescence in animals after intravenous injection.
