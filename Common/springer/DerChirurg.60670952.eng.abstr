 The essential limitations of laparoscopic procedures - lack of palpation, problematic retrieval of specimen and anastomosis, etc. - are abolished by the hand of the surgeon, which is inserted into the peritoneal cavity through a mini-laparotomy. While holding the pneumoperitoneum, the hand acts as an intelligent instrument performing surgical exploration, exposition of the field of operation, blunt dissection or intracorporal knot-tying. The mini-laparotomy is used to insert conventional instruments and suture material, as well as for specimen retrieval and anastomosis. Our preliminary experience (3 x splenectomy, 2 x sigmoid colectomy, 1 x anterior resection of rectum, 1 x proctocolectomy with J-pouch) shows that even extensive laparoscopic operations are accomplished much more simply. The time spent for such procedures is markedly reduced.
