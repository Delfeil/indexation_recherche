The limits of quantitation for cannabinoids in serum using automated solid-phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) have been determined. Extraction was performed automatically using C18-cartridges, extracts were methylated and analysed with selected-ion monitoring (SIM). The limits of quantitation (LOQ) in serum were determined according to Euronorm EN 45001 and German Industrial Norm DIN 32645 and were 0.1 and 0.7 ng/ml for tetrahydrocannabinol, 0.5 and 0.7 ng/ml for 11-hydroxy-tetrahydrocannabinol and < 0.25 and 1.6 ng/ml for tetrahydrocannabinolcarboxylic acid, respectively. The use of these LOQ's in forensic cases and the necessity of drug identification prior to quantitation are discussed in detail. Due to the newest amendment of the German traffic law (§24a "Straßenverkehrsgesetz") the quest for nationwide standardisation of the forensic analysis of illicit drugs in serum or blood arises. By automation of several manual sample preparation steps we could get closer to this aim. Taking into account a margin of safety, a qualitative cut-off at 1 ng/ml THC and a limit of quantitation of 2 ng/ml THC in serum should be achievable in all forensic toxicology laboratories.
