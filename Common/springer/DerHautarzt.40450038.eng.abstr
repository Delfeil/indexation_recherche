Abstract.  Lupus panniculitis is a rare variant of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Two typical cases demonstrate the association of lupus panniculitis with signs of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus. Clinically it is characterised by subcutaneous nodules or plaques, which may ulcerate leaving depressed atrophic scars. Histologically the lesions show lobular panniculitis. A positive immunofluorescent band test with deposition of IgG, IgM and C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction and blood vessel walls helps to confirm the diagnosis. The knowledge of the clinical features and histopathology of the disease is important because lupus panniculitis may precede systemic lupus erythematosus by some years.
