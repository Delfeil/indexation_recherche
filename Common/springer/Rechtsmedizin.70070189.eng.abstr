We report on a 64-year-old man who died within 1 h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency. Autopsy showed as cause of death a clinically unknown coagulase-negative staphylococci-induced left-sided endocarditis with perforation of the aortic and mitral valve. Infective endocarditis by coagulase-negative staphylococci in native valves is a rare event. The macroscopic appearance and histological findings are presented and discussed.
