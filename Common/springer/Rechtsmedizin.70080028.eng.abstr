 A 67-year-old man showing symptoms of septic shock died 24 h after admission to hospital, four days after receiving intramuscular injection of an antirheumatic to the right gluteal region for treatment of acute lumbago. The reason for septicemia was clinically unknown. Autopsy showed non-specific changes caused by shock. A circumscribed abscess was found in the right gluteal region where the intramuscular injection took place: histological examination showed small clusters of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus by bacteriological diagnosis). The intramuscular injection was confirmed as the origin of the Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
