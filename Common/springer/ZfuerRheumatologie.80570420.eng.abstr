 Quality assurance in rehabilitation of rheumatic diseases follows two programs, one developed by VDR (Verband Deutscher Rentenversicherungsträger) and the other developed by DGRh (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Rheumatologie). After introducing Total Quality Management to a rehabilitation center quality measurably increased. This improvement has been achieved by goal-directed steps and modification of clinical structures. Up to now patients' needs and the revision of in-patient treatment have been the central part af these activities. By organizing several special training courses staff has become more content and qualified. New forward-looking perspectives have been worked out in cooperation with other partners.
