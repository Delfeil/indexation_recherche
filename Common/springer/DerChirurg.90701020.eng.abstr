 Introduction: It was our aim to evaluate the results of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) with regard to recurrent hernias treated in our department. Methods: Included were 276 operations for first or subsequent recurrence of inguinal hernia previously treated with suture repair. All final repairs were carried out using the TAPP technique. The data were collected prospectively. The patients were examined 2 weeks and 1 year postoperatively. The rate of follow-up amounted to 78.1 % at 1 year after operation. Results: Perioperative complications were monitored prospectively and divided into intraoperative, minor and major. The overall complication rate amounted to 9 %, major complications 5.3 %. The re-recurrence rate was 0.4 %. Conclusions: Because of the general advantages of laparoscopic surgery and the low recurrence rate we prefer laparoscopic hernioplasty using the TAPP technique.
