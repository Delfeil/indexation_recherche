In psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the 'talking cure' because they tend to act instead of verbalizing their experiences interactive entanglements are rather common. Often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat. The symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then. Gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of 'body language' suggests. Instead as permanent concomitant of utterances it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist.
