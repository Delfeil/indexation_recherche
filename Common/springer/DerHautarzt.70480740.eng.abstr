A 39-year old male developed multiple verrucous papules on his back following a severe sunburn. Both the clinical features and pathology were typical for disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas. These benign skin lesions resemble the papules of Darier's disease, seborrhoic keratoses or verrucae planae. The light-exposed skin of the back is the site of predilection. Electron microscopy reveals a premature and altered cornification of keratinocytes. Epidermolytic acanthomas are acquired, harmless lesions and must be differentiated from more serious, congenital ichthyoses of the skin, showing the same histopathologic picture.
