Report on a 31-year-old male-tofemale transsexual prostitute with a 3-week history of worsening pruritus and dysaesthesia in her neovagina, which had been constructed by means of penile skin invagination. The microbial diagnostic tests for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) showed gonococcal infection in the high vagina, while none was found in the urethra. Other STD and allergic contact sensitization were excluded. Despite the regularly stratified epithelium of the neovagina, which is physiologically resistant to gonococcal infection, this possibility must be considered in transsexual prostitutes.
