The anaesthetic potency of the (S)-ketamine isomer is approximately double that of racemic ketamine. The aim of this study was to compare the recovery of cerebral function after a bolus of 1,3 mg/kg racemic ketamine or 0.65 mg/kg (S)-ketamine followed by continuous application of 4 or 2 mg/kgxh over 15 minutes.
