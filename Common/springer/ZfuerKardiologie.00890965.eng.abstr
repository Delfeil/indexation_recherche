 Intramural hematoma is a spontaneous, localized bleeding in the wall of the thoracic aorta without evidence of intimal tear. Clinically, intramural hematoma manifests itself as an acute thoracical pain in patients with hypertension and therefore shows parallels with the classical aortic dissection. In the literature there is controversial discussion whether intramural hematoma can be regarded as its own aortic pathology or a precursor in the development of classical aortic dissection.    We present the case of a 66 year old male who showed an intramural hematoma of the descending aorta which rapidly progressed to classical dissection within 3 months. This finding was secondarily accompanied by a dilatation of the descending aorta which leads to operative treatment with replacement of the proximal aorta descendens. This case supports the hypothesis that intramural hematoma is a potential early manifestation of aortic dissection and at the same time stresses the necessity for frequent follow-up investigations and, if necessary, early operative therapy.
