The treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an antidislocation augmentation. Tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed. For the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft, which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach. In cases of posterolateral instabilities, additional procedures are necessary.
