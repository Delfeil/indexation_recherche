 In a community sample of 394 eldery aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed. Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed. The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person. In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time. 88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year. 55.8% took at least one medicine each day. The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine. Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor. Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life. Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support. There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine.
