In the discussion of increasing costs of health care in Germany, the frequent and long hospital stays of elderly patients are often pointed out. Since these patients very frequently suffer from psychiatric disorders, psychiatric consultation is often required. This study was aimed at investigating whether new German laws concerning guardianship and the structure of health care providers change conditions for psychiatric consultation services. For this purpose, the documentation of all consultations in the years 1991 to 1995 was retrospectively evaluated. In about 3% of all patients aged over 65 referred to the General University Hospital of Lübeck, psychiatric consultation was ordered. The most frequent diagnosis was senile dementia. Comparison of the requests and psychiatric recommendations show a significant increase in wishes and recommendations for guardianship. Moreover, there is evidence of the increasing need of consultation in elderly patients. Possibly due to the new law concerning the structure of health care providers and the number of requests and recommendations to transfer patients to psychiatric wards, these results show that the new laws do affect psychiatric consultation.
