Since the mid-forties androgen deprivation is regarded the standard treatment of incurable prostate cancer. Antiandrogens can be given either as monotherapy or in combination with bilateral orchidectomy or gonadotropin-releasing-hormone analoga. Recently reports have been published that withdrawal of antiandrogens in patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer caused reduction of PSA and clinical improvement. Thus, in patients who progress under maximal androgen blockade or antiandrogen-monotherapy the antiandrogen should first be withdrawn and - in case of monotherapy - be replaced by GnRH-analoga. In approximately 30-50 % of the cases a reduction of serum-PSA can be expected lasting for approx. 6 months. In some patients an improvement of symptoms and objective remission is observed.
