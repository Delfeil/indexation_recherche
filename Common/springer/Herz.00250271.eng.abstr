Cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure, as a function of severity of disease. The source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research. Potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation, a neurohumoral dysbalance with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an overspill of cytoines from the failing heart itself. We present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system, particularly interleukin 6 release.
