Background: Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common malignant orbital tumor in children. Treatment modalities (individualized therapy or study protocol) have been changed radically.

The objective of our retrospective analysis was to define the prognosis in correlation to changes of treatment in an unselected patient group of a single institution.
