The needle type introduced by Edward Tuohy for continuous spinal anaesthesia in 1944 is still used as the standard instrument for epidural anaesthesia up to the present day. Puncture of the dura and severance of the epidural catheter are the typical, though rare, complications of this procedure, giving rise to most of the actions brought for damage suffered during obstetic anaesthesia. The cerebral spinal fluid loss caused by thick needles can have serious consequences, including subdural and intracranial haematoma, cranial nerve pareses, labyrinthine hearing impairments and pneumocephalus.
