The life span of HIV-infected patients has increased because of anti-retroviral therapy and improved means for treating opportunistic infections. However, HIV infection and subsequent immunosuppression result in an increased risk of high-grade B-cell lymphomas. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, localization, clinical features, therapy and survival time of patients with HIV-related lymphomas of the head and neck. Between 1988 and 1995, 280 HIV-infected patients presented with otolaryngologic symptoms. Seventy-two (25.7%) were found to have a neoplastic disease.  Fifty-six of these patients (20%) were diagnosed as having Kaposi's sarcoma and 12 (4.3%) had lymphomas. According to the Kiel classification, lymphomas were subdivided into Hodgkin's disease (2 cases) and B-cell lymphomas of high-grade malignancy (10 cases). These latter cases were centroblastic (n=4), Burkitt's type (n=4), anaplastic large cell (n=1) and not classifiable (n=1). All patients with HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) were men and 8 were homosexuals. The mean age was 36.1 years. In addition to 7 nodal locations, high-grade B-cell lymphomas were found in the oropharynx (n=2) and palate (n=1). Four patients underwent chemotherapy, 1 patient underwent radiation therapy and 2 were treated with both methods. Two patients did not receive any treatment and 1 patient underwent laser therapy. The survival time depended on the previous diagnosis of AIDS, the patients' immune status and the Karnofsky index. In 2 patients the lymphoma led to the diagnosis of HIV infection. Our findings show that any solitary or enlarging tumors or ulcerating lesions in the head and neck region of HIV patients must be examined histologically to exclude HIV-NHL. We also recommend that young patients with high-grade B-cell lymphomas should undergo HIV screening.
