 The number of women with congenital cardiac disease, who mature into adulthood is increasing. Unfortunately, there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients. Most women with congenital cardiac disease can safely use oral contracetives, especially low-estrogen combination or progestin-only preparations, with the exception of those, who are at particular risk because of thrombembolic complications (especially in cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger reaction, rhythm disturbances), fluid retention (especially in reduced ventricular function and congestive heart failure), arterial hypertension (important in coarctation), infectious complications (endocarditis) or hyperlipidemia. Oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events. Intrauterine devices are very effective, have no metabolic side effects and merely cary a small risk of endocarditis. Newer devices containing progesterone only may put the patients at a still smaller risk. Contraceptive subdermal implants (e.g. levonorgestrel) are used with good results in the United States for patients with contraindications to estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and may well become more widely accepted in patients in Germany in the coming years. Barrier methods can be used, but have a higher failure rate, which may be inacceptable in patients at risk (e.g. Eisenmenger's). Especially in Eisenmenger's, permanent sterilisation should be advised.
