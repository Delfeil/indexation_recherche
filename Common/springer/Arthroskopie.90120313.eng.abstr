Since 1993, 30 patients with acute intraarticular distal radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance. In 12 patients (40%) concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed. According to Geissler we found grade I-tear in one patient, grade II in three, grade III in six and grade IV in two patients. The eight individuals with grade III-and IV-lesions additionally revealed marked instablity intraoperatively. Therefore, operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and scaphocapitate arthrodesis. Seven patients out of this group (87.5%) were followed up clinically and radiologically 3 years postoperatively, on average. Clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability. Objective grip strength was measured using a Jamar tester and compared to the contralateral wrist. Radiological evaluation consisted of the posteroanterior and lateral view as well as stress views in radial and ulnar deviation. Data were evaluated by the Jakim and Cooney scoring system as well as the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al. According to Gartland, 100% of our patients showed an excellent result; these rates were 86% using the Jakim score and 60% using the Cooney scoring system. According to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result.
