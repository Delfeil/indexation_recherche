  Catheter ablation of the preexcitation syndrome is a curative treatment. Accessory pathways between structures of the specific conduction system or working myocardium are morphologic prerequisites for orthodromic or antidromic reentrant tachycardia of various frequency, duration, and rate. Detection of mechanisms of tachyarrhythmias and understanding the role of accessory pathways in tachycardia, mapping of accessory connections, function of nodal conduction svstem, and additional accessory pathways are necessary for successful catheter ablation. Anomalies of the tricuspid valve and coronary sinus and concomitant disease of the heart should be investigated prior to catheter ablation using echocardiography and contrast injection. Different variations of the preexcitation syndroine and the results of catheter ablation in 300 patients are demonstrated.
