Hiccup is defined as involuntary contractions of the diaphragm and the auxiliary respiratory muscles, mostly in irregular series, followed by glottic closure, thereby producing a typical "hiccuping" inspiration. This is a physiologic phenomenon, which already exists in utero. Hiccup is believed to be a gastrointestinal reflex; however, function and the reflex arch are hypothetical. Acute hiccup is  distinguished from pathological, chronic  hiccup, defined by a duration execuiding 48 h, or recurrent episodes. Among approximately 100 causes for hiccup, the most common are located in the gastrointestinal tract, with gastro-esophageal reflux as the most important. While the respiratory effect is generally negligible, alkalosis may ensue in tracheotomized patients due to hyperventilation. A stepwise management plan for patients with hiccup is presented. If simple physical maneuvers and causal therapy fail, or causal therapy is impossible, the treatment of choice is medical, with baclofen. Interruption of the reflex arch may be causal therapy or be considered as a last resort.
