In the second child of consanguine turkish parents (family history, pregnancy, birth, neonatal period uneventful) arthrogryposis multiplex was diagnosed at the age of 6 weeks. Despite intensive physiotherapy, the contractures did not improve. With 20 months the child presented perianal filamentous tumors, multiple subcutaneous tumors, hyperplastic gingiva, painful contractures of all extremities, a coarse face and bilateral osteolysis of the tibia. Histology of gingiva, subcutaneous and perianal tumors showed subepithelial fibrous tissue with small vessels and connective tissue cells embedded in a PAS positive matrix. Together with the clinical findings juvenile hyaline fibromatosis was diagnosed.
