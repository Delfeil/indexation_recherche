Intramedullary stabilisation of long bones is an established treatment option since Küntscher. Especially for tibial nailing different methodes were proposed in the past, were as the use of a fracture table was more or less the standard procedure. Since 4 years now we are nailing tibial fractures whithout fracture table. We are now using more and more a simple carbon fibre-frame, easily assembled by parts of the AO external fixator. So we can minimize the additional iatrogenic soft tissue damage during surgery and the logistic preoperative set-up in the operation theatre is shorter.
