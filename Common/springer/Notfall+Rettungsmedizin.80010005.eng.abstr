Health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a humane society, the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies. The ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics. Their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to dilemmas characteristic of emergency care. Due to dwindling resources, the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized. Possibilities of rationalizing care without compromising its quality are being discussed, such as renouncing futile therapy and implementing measures of prevention. If emergency medical services are to accomplish their mission, however, observing standards of medical practice, legal provisions, and the given framework of society, they must not surrender to pure cost containment.
