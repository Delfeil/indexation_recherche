The adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the only mitochondrial carrier for ADP and ATP, combines mitochondrial energy-producing and cytosolic energy-consuming processes. The ANT function was observed to be impaired in explanted heart tissue from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In order to clariry whether an altered ANT isoform composition might be responsible for the restricted ANT function, we analyzed the ANT isoform expression pattern in the myocardium of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy.
