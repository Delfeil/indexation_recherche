Forty-one patients with locally advanced hypopharyngeal carcinomas were followed for at least 3 years (median, 60 months) after simultaneous radiochemotherapy. Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy was administered as 5x2 Gy/week to a total dose of 30 Gy within 3 weeks. From the fourth week an accelerated hyperfractionated schedule was used as 2x1.4 Gy/day five days weekly given exclusively to the first order target volume of macroscopic tumor (adding up to a total dose of 72 Gy in six weeks). The second and third order target volumes received conventional fractionation only to 60 Gy and 50 Gy, respectively. The moderate acceleration of the concomitant boost scheme in the second half was counterbalanced during the first week by the introduction of a 5-fluorouracil bolus of 350 mg/M2 with 200 mg/M2 folinic acid and a subsequent continuous infusion using the same dose each 24 h for 5 days. Additionally, a Mitomycin-C bolus of 10 mg/M2 was infused at the fifth day and on the first day of the sixth week. Six weeks after treatment the patients were restaged. In cases with residual carcinoma salvage surgery was performed (11 patients). Late effects of therapy were analyzed according to the Lent-Soma index and life quality according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Modul. Late effects of treatment were tolerable and were controlled locally. The 3-year-survival rate was 39%, with a local-regional recurrence-free control rate of 71%. Fifty-two percent of all cases of death were caused by distant metastases, secondary carcinomas or other diseases not related to tumor recurrence. The poor prognosis of hypopharyngeal carcinomas despite acceptable local tumor control may be due to specific biological factors present in affected patients.
