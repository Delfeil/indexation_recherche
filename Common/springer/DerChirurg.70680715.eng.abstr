 A prospective randomized study was designed to determine the effect of postoperative water contact on tissue healing. A total of 121 patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups. The first group was permitted to shower postoperatively, allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water, the second group was instructed to keep the incision dry. Water contact, wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed. There was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection.
