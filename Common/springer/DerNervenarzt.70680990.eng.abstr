Hemiballism is a rare hyperkinetic disorder which is characterized by irregular vigorous rotatory movements of the limbs of one side of the body. The disabling and exhausting movements with their high risk of severe injuries require an acute drug treatment. However, there are no common guidelines for the treatment of this disorder. Therefore we reviewed the available literature to establish a concept for a rational symptomatic drug treatment. Furthermore, own observations in 6 patients with hemiballism of different origins are reported.
