An overview of the 30 years history and developement of documentation and information systems in the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is presented. Since the foundation in 1967 four developmental phases can be described: first initiatives of medical doctors, establishment of a basic documentation system for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning and realisation of information systems with the possibility of controlling in medical areas and thereby steering of the services. Planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the masterplans and concepts of the university clinics of the state of Baden-Württemberg.
