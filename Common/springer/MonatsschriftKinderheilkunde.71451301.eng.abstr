Background: The use of nasal thermistors to record nasal airflow for the detection of obstructive apneas has become routine in polysomnographic investigations. However, artefacts can lead to false - positive apnea patterns which cannot be clearly rejected by visual control of the recordings. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of capnography for the detection of obstructive apneas as an alternative method.
