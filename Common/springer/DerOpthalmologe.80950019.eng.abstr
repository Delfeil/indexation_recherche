Background and purpose: In Germany, 750,000 children are born per year who should be screened for developmental visual defects in the age range 24-48 months. However, the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and microtropia screening.
