 The hepatorenal syndrome is defined as the development of renal failure in patients with severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable cause of renal functional impairment. The pathogenesis of this obviously functional renal failure is complex and not completely understood. Of importance seems to be a peripheral and systemic vasodilatation with redistribution of blood volume. Nitric oxide seems to play a major role as a possible primary mediator. As a consequence changes in several different pathophysiological mechanisms (sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin, endothelin, prostanoids, natriuretic peptides) lead to a functional renal impairment which is characterized by renal cortical vasoconstriction. Supportive treatment and intensive monitoring of the cardiovascular circulation is the main goal in the care of these patients. The mortality is still high exceeding 90%. Renal extracorporeal support should be initiated using a continuous method when recovery of liver function is expected (acute liver failure, waiting for liver transplantation). The only effective and permanent treatment is orthotopic liver transplantation.
