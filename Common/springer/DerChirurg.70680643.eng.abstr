 Failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem. Although ultrasonography has 95 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to erroneous interpretation. We report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal colic and ultrasonographically confirmed cholecystolithiasis. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the gallbladder could not be detected. After laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography, agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed. This method can be considered for diagnosis of gallbladder agenesis without the need for laparotomy and thorough exploration.
