 Rudolf Nissen was born in Neisse, Schlesien, 9 September 1896. From 1921 to 1933 he was the favorite pupil of Ferdinand Sauerbruch in Munich and Berlin. 1930 he became professor of surgery at the Charité. The assumption of power by the Nazi-regime forced Nissen to resign his position and end his career in Germany. He took over the surgical chair in Istanbul, Turkey. Emigrating in 1939 to the USA, he held surgical positions in hospitals at New York and accepted in 1952 the chair of Surgery at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Nissen died in Riehen/Basel on 22 January 1981. Nissen was a critical observant clinician, an efficient and popular physician, a teacher and a speaker. Of historical significance are pioneering works in thoracic surgery, the first successful pneumectomy in man, the classical works about the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and hiatus hernia. The Nissen-Rossetti type of fundoplication has remained the standard procedure in Europe and the USA.
