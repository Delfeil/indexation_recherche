The German Society of Pathology emerged from the Society of German Scientists and Physicians. Founded in Braunschweig in 1897, the first scientific meeting was held in Düsseldorf in 1898. Rudolf Virchow was the first chairman up to this death in 1902. From the beginning the Society with its former name of German Pathological Society till the 2nd world war, was an association of German-speaking countries including Austrian and Swiss pathologists who also regularly presided at the meetings. Alternately the meetings were held in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland. The 100-year-history of the Society has been documented in 80 volumes of the meetings so far. Since 1903 these are published by Gustav Fischer, Jena-Stuttgart. The scientific results of the anual meetings show not only the growth and development of Pathology, but also the lectures and papers to the main subjects contribute considerably to the history of medical basic research in the 20th century. The chairmen's speeches combine to a history of problems in the subject of Pathology. Rudolf Virchow began it with his opening address in 1898. A special chapter covers the period of national socialism and German partition after the 2nd world war. The German Pathological Society suffered great losses by dismissal and emigration after 1933. Institutes rich in tradition got lost in East Germany. The partition of Germany, especially after construction of the wall, excluded the East German colleagues for Society life. An attempt has been made to record the losses in numbers by evaluation of the member lists of the meeting volumes. At the end of the century and after overcoming of the German partition, the German Society of Pathology has got a chance for revival.
