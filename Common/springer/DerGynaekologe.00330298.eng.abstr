A modified cesarean section technique has been developed at the Misgav-Ladach Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel. This technique has become very popular recently. Laparotomy (according to Joel-Cohen) is performed transversely at a level above the pubic hair, dissection is mainly blunt. The uterus is closed in single-layer and the wound closure is minimal; only the rectus sheath and skin are sutured. Both the visceral and parietal peritoneum are left open, and so are the rectus muscles and subcutaneous fat. Prospective studies demonstrated a shortening of operating time and saving of materials. There is strong evidence that the postoperative course is uncomplicated and hospital stay is shortened when compared to the traditional cesarean section. No disadvantage has been reported yet. According to the available data, the Misgav-Ladach technique for cesarean delivery can be recommended.
