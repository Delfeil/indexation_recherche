 The increasing number of high-risk patients and the limited number of intensive care beds and shrinking hospital budgets make it necessary to review perioperative management processes. Analyzing the data of the Heidelberg Anesthesia documentation system revealed improvement strategies in operating room management. The coordination of all groups involved is optimized by an operating room management group. This independent group plans and coordinates the operating room procedures, together with emergency cases according to personal, room and specific needs. Establishment of a holding area and a postoperative anesthesia care unit next to central operating units will significantly improve the perioperative organization processes. Redistribution of personnel enables intermediate care units to be opened, which provide additional intensive care bed capacity.
