 Between 1984 and 1996 we performed a Mason gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity: 14 patients (average age 40 (26-48) years, body mass index (BMI) 48 (37-71) kg/m2, excessive body weight 67 (41-116) kg). Since the end of 1996 we now apply adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding (lab band): 73 patients (average age 39 (22-64) years, BMI 45 (32-69) kg/m2, excessive body weight 66 (41-116) kg). We compared the early and late results of both methods. Early results: no relevant morbidity or mortality for neither method. Late/intermediate results: reoperation rate for both methods 15 %. After an average of 3.7 years the excessive body weight loss (EWL) for gastroplasty was 54 (22-96) %. The EWL after lab band for 24 patients after 12 months was 47 (11-127) % and for 8 patients after 18 months 51 (28-139) %. Since the introduction of the lap band the number of bariatric operations has greatly increased. Nevertheless, the perioperative complication rate has remained low, and the long-term outcome is similar for both methods.
