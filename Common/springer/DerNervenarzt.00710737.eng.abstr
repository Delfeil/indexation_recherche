Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) or idiopathic environmental intolerance (IEI) is understood as an acquired disorder with multiple recurrent symptoms that cannot be traced to any well-known medical or psychiatric condition and is associated with diverse environmental influences that are well tolerated by the majority of people. In a prospective study, we investigated 120 consecutive patients admitted a university-based outpatient department for environmental medicine during 1 year. Apart from routine medical examination and special toxicological diagnostic procedures, a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was performed with every patient. At least one psychiatric diagnosis was found in 100 patients. The diagnostic criteria for somatoform disorders were filled by 53 patients. We found lifetime or current affective disorders in 39 patients, anxiety disorders in 29, and substance dependency or abuse in 25. In 16 patients, personality disorders were diagnosed. Nine suffered from psychotic disorders. This is the largest prospective study with standardized psychiatric diagnostic methods concerning psychiatric morbidity and MCS. The data show that many patients with environmental health problems obviously suffer from somatoform disorders but also from other, well-known psychiatric conditions.
