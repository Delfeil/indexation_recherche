Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are known to exhibit far less cardiac side effects than tricyclic antidepressants. We report three cases in which the SSRI, paroxetine, induced clinically relevant ECG changes in patients with high risk profile. In two cases an increase in QTc time was observed, severe bradycardia was also observed twice.
