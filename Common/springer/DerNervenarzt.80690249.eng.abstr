In this magnetoencephalography study the issue of hemispheric lateralisation in patients with schizophrenia was addressed using acoustically evoked neuromagnetic fields. The characteristics of dipoles in the superior temporal gyrus, the primary auditory cortex, were calculated. In contrast to other studies, alterations did not concern the localisation, but rather the orientation of dipoles. Of pathophysiological interest was that the dipoles abnormalities were found left-hemispherically in male (p=0.02) and right-hemispherically in female patients with schizophrenia (p=0.01) when compared to controls. The findings suggest gender-specific alterations of hemispheric lateralisation in schizophrenia.
