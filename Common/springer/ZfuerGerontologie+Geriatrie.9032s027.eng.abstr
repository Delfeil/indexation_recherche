  Prolonged suboptimal intake of micronutrients leads via a series of mechanisms to impairment of cognitive performance. Supplementation can correct these deficits. Malnutrition impairs cognitive performance only when micronutrient levels fall below certain critical thresholds. Malnutrition in the elderly is commonly the result of preexisting mental impairment due to chronic diseases. These also lead to accelerated neuronal destruction via a stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal exis. Subtle dietary deficits can lead over many years to quantifiable impairment of cognitive performance. Severe dietary deficiency leading to major cognitive impairment is nevertheless rare.
