 Decreased lung opacity is one of the most common radiographic signs in cardiothoracic surgery. The most important clues to differential diagnosis are illustrated by two cases of reduced lung opacity from the cardiothoracic ward. Usually, the etiology can be defined in the supine chest film even before additional tests such as thoracic ultrasound, computed tomography, or decubitus films are requested.
