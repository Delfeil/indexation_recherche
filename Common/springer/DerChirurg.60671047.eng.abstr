 A possible intraoperative complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is opening of the gallbladder with subsequent loss of gallstones. We report on a 61-year-old woman who was hospitalised with an obscure subhepatic tumor. Intraoperatively an abscess was found that had been caused by lost gallstones following after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 3 years previously. There is a low incidence of late abscesses caused by loss of gallstones, but because of the long latency and unspecific symptoms there may be problems in diagnosis. Taking into consideration possible complications caused by intraoperative loss of gallstones, all concrements should be retrieved, even though there is no indication for changing to an open procedure.
