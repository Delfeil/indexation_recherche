Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) was applied in 500 consecutive treatments for 445 patients within 2 years. Indications were arterio-venous malformations (93 patients), schwannomas of cranial nerves (75 patients), meningiomas (79 patients; 73 of the tumors involving the skull base), pituitary adenomas (40 patients), craniopharyngiomas (13 cases), gliomas (13 cases), rare indications (12 cases), and brain metastases (126 patients). In arterio-venous malformations two complications were observed whereas two other patients underwent surgery due to intracranial hemorrhage in the latent period after GKRS. In all cases follow-up with MRI showed evidence of an active obliteration process. Out of 24 patients with a follow-up over 1 year, angiography revealed complete obliteration in 9 patients so far. A partial obliteration was evidenced by MRI in 15 cases. In benign tumors (meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas) tumor control rates of 88 % and 89 % were achieved, respectively. Treatment related side effects were mild and rare; no facial palsy occured after primary Gamma Knife treatment. GKRS was particularly effective in inoperable skull base meningiomas. Cerebral metastases were controlled in 89.5 % by a single Gamma Knife treatment. The mean survival period was 11.8 months. In patients receiving a single Gamma Knife treatment the mean survival time was 9.1 months. For patients undergoing multiple (up to 5) sessions of GKRS (because of new tumors) the mean survival period was 17.2 months. MRI showed evidence of adverse radiation reactions in 10/124 patients (8.1 %) which were symptomatic in 3 patients (0.8 %). The results obtained in patients with cerebral metastases emphasize that GKRS alone is as effective as the combined treatment of these lesions by surgery and fractionated radiotherapy. Our results demonstrated an attractively high therapeutic gain factor of Gamma Knife treatment in key indications of radiosurgery.
