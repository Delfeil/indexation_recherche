Today, estrogen therapy of postmenopausal women is clinical routine. Hormone substitution in aging men, however, has only recently become a research topic. As a result, guidelines for general androgen substitution of aging men are still lacking and androgen substitution should be restricted to patients with documented testosterone deficiency, i. e. hypogonadism. The incidence of hypogonadism increases with advancing age. For substitution testosterone, as produced by the testes, should be the preferred molecule. Of the available injectable, oral and transdermal preparations transdermal systems have the advantage of mimicking the physiological serum testosterone levels. Prostate carcinoma is the most important reason not to start or to interrupt testosterone therapy. There is no scientific evidence to justify the use of testosterone precursors, e. g. dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or metabolites, e. g. dihydrotestosterone or estrogens, for substitution in aging men.
