  In patients with an acute arterial occlusion of the right upper extremity a Doppler scanning examination should be done before balloon catheter embolectomy. If there is no arterial puls detectable, an angiography should be performed afterwards to localize the embolus. In case of a proximal arterial occlusion of the right arm we recommend this procedure to prevent an embolus dislocation by catheter embolectomy and following cerebral embolization. For direct surgical embolectomy we recommend a supraclavicular incision.
