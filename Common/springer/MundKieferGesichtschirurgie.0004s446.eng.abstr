Gradual callus distraction in the correction of hypoplastic areas in the viscerocranial skeleton is an established method due to its efficacy. Whereas functional and esthetical improvements can be seen easily, it is impossible to get the increase of the bony mass right using the distractor scale or by clinical investigation. Only in animal studies can volumetric and densitometric measurements be done directly. By permission of the local ethics commission, in a clinical study, CT data of 24 children (12 unilateral and bilateral hypoplasias each) taken before and after mandibular distraction osteogenesis were used to get information on the amount of created bone and the grade of ossification of the callus at the time of the distractor removal. The CT data were prepared for computer evaluation using software which had been especially developed for this investigation. The quality of the investigation was influenced by disturbed data acquisition (insufficient sedation, Gantry deviation, different axial cuts). Therefore, the estimation of the real increase of bone was not possible, but all in all an increase of the volume could be seen. Using a grey scale analysis, the grade of new bone ossification was over 90% at the time of distractor removal. In our opinion, these results argue against the use of CT scans for the validation of a mandibular distraction. The estimation of the volume is very imprecise, the grade of ossification of the new bone very constant.
