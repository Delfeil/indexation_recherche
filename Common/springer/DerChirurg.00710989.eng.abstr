Abstract.  Interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing. Limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability. Although larger movements still promote callus formation, the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered. Fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large. A combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non-union. Therefore, having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach, one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis. Dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap, stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process. External mechanical stimulation, however, has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load-bearing patients.
