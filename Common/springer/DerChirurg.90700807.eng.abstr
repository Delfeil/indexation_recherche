 Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract, have not yet been fully investigated. Although good progress has been made in their diagnosis, classification of these lesions with regard to their histogenesis and biological behavior remains problematic. Between 1994 and 1998, 18 GIST patients underwere operation in the Department of Surgery. Twelve of these patients (67 %) had stromal tumors in the stomach, and six (33 %) had intestinal stromal tumors. The primary tumor could be removed in all patients with R0 resection. Six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis, with the size of their primary tumor exceeding 10 cm. Extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case. Lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur. Histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of Lewin, Weinstein and Riddell. Currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases. Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have failed.
