We report on a 32-year-old male patient with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, who presented with excessive numbers of superinfected basal cell carcinoma. This led us to suspect an underlying HIV infection, which was confirmed by ELISA and Western blotting. Laboratory investigation of the immunological state revealed severe immunosuppression with 267 CD4+ lymphocytes and a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.3. The histological picture showed multiple basal cell carcinomas, some of them transforming into squamous cell carcinomas. We suspect that the excessive number and the unusual clinical and histological picture of the basal cell carcinomas in this patient were probably influenced by the underlying HIV infection.
