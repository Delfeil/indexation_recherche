There are some case reports about excessive heat production in the absorbent canister when sevoflurane or enflurane are washed into a circle containing dried soda lime. This observation was often made in the DRÄGER ISO 8 circle system with the gas inlet upstream of the soda lime canister with the gas-flow from bottom to top.
