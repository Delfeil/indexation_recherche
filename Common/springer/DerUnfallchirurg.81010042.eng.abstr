From March 1994 to March 1996, 287 patients, presenting with lower extremity injuries, who required immobilizing bandages or casts, where included in a prospective, randomized study. These patients received either low-molecular heparin or acetylsalicylic acid for thrombosis prophylaxis. In all patients a clinical examination and a colour-coded duplex sonography were performed after removal of the cast for detection of lower extremity venous thrombosis. A plebography was performed when thrombosis was suspected. A subcutaneous injection of clivarin 1750 was given once daily in 143 patients. Thrombosis prophylaxis with Aspirin 2 x 500 mg administered orally was performed in 144 patients. Deep vein thrombosis occurred in 9 patients (6.3 %) with clivarin prophylaxis and in 7 patients (4.8 %) treated with Aspirin. In both groups, no clinically significant side effects of the medications were observed.
