Diabetes mellitus as a disease of epidemiological impact leads to diabetic cardiopathy by modulation of myocardial, vascular and metabolic components. This includes the development of a coronary microangiopathy and a decrease of diastolic and systolic function of the left ventricle as well as the development of an autonomic diabetic neuropathy. Patients with diabetes show an increased mortality concerning cardiovascular events. They more often suffer from myocardial infarction as non-diabetics mostly with a more serious course. Moreover, the post-infarction course is affected with a worse prognosis as in non-diabetics.
