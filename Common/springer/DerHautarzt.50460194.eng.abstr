Abstract.  We report on a patient with multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma, whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis. Spontaneous remission of the tumour, which has now been maintained for over 2 years, the change from the primary monomorphological fibrocytic appearance to a polymorphological histiocytic picture with multiple fat-storing giant cells, and the lacking demonstration of specific cell organelles finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed.
