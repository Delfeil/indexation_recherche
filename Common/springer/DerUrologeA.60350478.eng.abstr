In this study a modified experimental kidney xenograft model was developed, which reproduced, in a reliable way, the course of hyperacute rejection. In this model guinea-pig kidneys were transplanted to rats using end-to-side anastomoses with recipient aorta and vena cava, respectively, and ureter drainage for diuresis monitoring. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of complement modulation by soluble complement receptor 1 (sCR1) on the xenografts. Twenty-four xenotransplantations were performed and recipients randomized for treatment either by 3 ml saline or 50 mg/kg sCR1 as a 3-ml bolus. It was found that sCR1 was highly efficient in delaying hyperacute rejection from 10.5  +/-  2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the therapy group and in prolongation of graft function. The complement activity was significantly reduced in the sCR1-treated rats, even at the time of rejection, as a result of complement modulation in this group of xenograft recipients. Xenografts from saline-treated animals showed necroses, interstitial haemorrhages and platelet aggregates occluding the vessels as soon as 10 min after the reperfusion started. No such changes could be seen even after 120 min in the xenografted kidneys of sCR1-treated rats. Also C3 deposits in the glomeruli and interstitium were markedly reduced.
