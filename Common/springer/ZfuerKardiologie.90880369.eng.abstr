  Ventricular arrhythmias can both result from and cause myocardial dysfunction. We report a case of a two-year-old girl with ventricular tachycardia showing signs of heart failure consisting with a tachycardiomyopathy. The therapy with class I and class III antiarrhythmic drugs did not improve the cardiac situation significantly. The cardiologic investigations were consistent with the verapamilsensitive ventricular tachycardia in young adults. The treatment with verapamil led to a normal rhythm and function of the heart.
