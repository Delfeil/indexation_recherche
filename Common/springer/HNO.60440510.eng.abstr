During surgical resections carotid body tumors may bleed profusely due to their vascularity. Preoperative angiographic embolization of tumor-supplying arteries has reduced intraoperative blood loss significantly. The present study reviews our clinical experiences with 13 paragangliomas of the carotid bifurcation in 12 patients during the past 5 years. In 6 patients (46.1%) computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated extensive spread of the tumor up to the base of the skull. Tumors of this size were initially assessed as being inoperable but curative surgical resections were performed after embolization of tumor-supplying arteries by intravascular injections of Gelfoam and implantations of microcoils. Vascular reconstruction of the internal carotid artery by a saphenous vein graft was required in 4 patients (30.7%). In 3 malignant paragangliomas (23.0%) adjuvant radiotherapy of 50-60 Gy was administered to the tumor site after surgery. During an average follow-up of 29 months, one malignant paraganglioma was found to have recurred locally 13 months after initial therapy.
