 We report on a case of extensive intraabdominal calcifications resulting from previous bacterial peritonitis. The patient suffered from an obstructive ileus. Relaparotomy was performed and the calcifications resected. To avoid recurrence, radiotherapy (15 Gy) and indomethacin were given. A literature review revealed only two cases of intraabdominal calcifications following peritonitis.
