Abstract  We present an algorithm for the rational diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type I (GA1). Normal urinary organic acids in patients with non-specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely, and no further investigations are required. In other patients, the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical, neuroradiological and biochemical findings. GCDH enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom GA1 is very likely.
