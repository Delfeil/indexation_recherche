Tumour growth is directly related  to the multiplication of tumour cell numbers which can be caused, firstly, by increased proliferation and, secondly, by prolongation of the life span of tumour cells. The aim was the quantification of the increase and decrease (apoptosis) in cell numbers in relation to the cytological grading of oral squamous epithelial cell carcinoma. Proof of apoptosis-specific fragmentation of DNA (double-strand breaks) by the TUNEL method (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling) and of proliferative activity by the monoclonal antibody MIB 1 was found in 41 oral squamous epithelial carcinomas of different grading. With progression of the cytological grading, an increase of proliferative activity and a decrease of apoptotic activity occurs. The apoptosis rates were 13.5% for G1 carcinomas, 8.5% for G2 carcinomas and 6.1% for G3 carcinomas. The results confirm that during progression to higher malignant cellular phenotypes of oral squamous carcinoma, increased proliferative activity as well as reduced apoptosis rates contribute substantially to the multiplication of tumour cell numbers and show that during progression a loss of control of programmed cell death (apoptosis) occurs. However, the high standard deviations of apoptosis rates within the different grades disprove an individual prognostic significance.
