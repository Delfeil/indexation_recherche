A genuine cat poxvirus was isolated in a 9-year-old girl with a circumscribed cat-scratch at her left forearm, where subsequently an erythema with multiple ulcers evolved. Serological and histological methods were used to characterize the virus. Cats and rodents are discussed as potential virus carriers. A voluntary vaccination against orthopox viruses could be necessary for persons at risk.
