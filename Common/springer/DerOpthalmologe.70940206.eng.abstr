Background: In Central and South America, Chagas' disease is of great epidemiologic importance. The epidemiologic agent is represented by Trypanosoma cruzi, a monocellular parasite, instrumental in human infection is the presence of vectors, which are various species of hematophagous bugs. The eye is one of the most important entrance sites of the parasite, and relatively little information about the relationship between Chagas' disease and eye complications is available.
