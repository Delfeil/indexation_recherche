 Between June 1993 and September 1995, 18 distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail. There were 8 type A fractures and 10 type C fractures (AO classification). The operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch. Follow-up was available on all patients and averaged 18.3 months (range 6-32 months). All fractures healed with an average time to union of 12.4 weeks (range 8-16 weeks). Bone grafting was not necessary in any case. Sixteen patients achieved almost the same ROM as they had had before the injury. One patient developed a varus malignment and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy 20 months post trauma. There were no infections or nonunions. The retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of dia- and supracondylar femoral fractures.
