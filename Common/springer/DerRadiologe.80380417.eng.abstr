The extended field of view imaging procedure named "SieScape" provides, for the first time, a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to 60 cm in length. This allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view, without having to assemble several pictures. Furthermore, pathological find-ings can be shown in full size in their surroundings. This method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding, for instance a tumor, during therapy.
