  Recognizing the various complexities integral to CO2 elimination and oxygen availability establishes the need for invasive respiratory monitoring. Hypercapneic failure may be the result of several pathological factors, which include CO2 production, dead-space ratio, and total minute ventilation. The latter comprises interactive balances that include central respiratory drive, respiratory impedance, and respiratory muscle capacity. Invasive monitoring is currently available to assess each of these factors. However, some of them are primarily research tools (e.g., diaphragmatic electromyographic analyses, tensiontime index). At what level each is utilized will depend on the patient population, hospital economics, adequate nutritional plans, and a sound data base. Invasive respiratory monitoring in hypoxemic respiratory failure can lead to greater accuracy in diagnosis as well as in determining the patient's response to therapy. The level of priority depends on the patient's demands and the hospital economics. The approach to monitoring may also be based on the suspected pathophysiological etiology of hypoxemia and could include arterial, pulmonary capillary, and mixed-venous sampling, associated calculations (e.g., oxygen content), alveolar gas metering, estimation of shunt, mouth occlusion pressures, wedge pressure, stroke volume, expiratory hold, volume-time curves, and flow-time curves. Almost all standard ICUs have the capacity to determine these measurements. Most of the data are obtained as part of routine ICU management of the critically ill patient, and only few options are used by researchers (e.g., multiple inert gas elimination technique). In summary, monitoring both hypercapneic and hypoxemic respiratory failure invasively and accurately plays a crucial role in critical care.
