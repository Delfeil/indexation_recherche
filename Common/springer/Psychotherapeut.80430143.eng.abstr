This surveillance study presents a literature review concerning the very inhomogeneous care emphasis of the acute psychosocial crisis both with respect to crisis insight and therapy methods and to professional responsibility. In detail general care models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention are described, as well as disorder- and event-specific concepts and papers on crisis intervention with children, teen-agers, and adolescents of the last 10 years. In addition, the contributions of the empirical psychotherapy research and their results are presented as far as they are relevant to crisis intervention.
