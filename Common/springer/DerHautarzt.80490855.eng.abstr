In 1986 Rongioletti introduced the term  acral persistent papular mucinosis for persistent papules on the dorsum of the hands and distal forearms. Skin specimens reveal mucin deposits which resemble those in lichen myxedematosus (LM). Laboratory results are usually unremarkable. Our 54-year-old female patient showed a 21/2 year history of skin lesions in the typical acral distribution pattern. This entity appears to be an acral papular subtype of LM. In the classification of LM, acral papular lichen myxedematosus should replace the discrete papular form. This latter form has been well known for many years, but is not sufficiently definable and is of secondary clinical importance.
