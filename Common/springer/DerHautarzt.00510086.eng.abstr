Two boys aged 6 and 9 years presented with persistent sharply circumscribed perianal erythema. One boy had no other skin findings; the other had additional lesions on the genitalia and extremities. The diagnosis of perianal streptococcal dermatitis was made after streptococci were cultured from skin swabs. This primarily childhood disease should be distinguished from candidiasis and perianal atopic dermatitis. As in our cases, topical therapy is usually ineffective and oral penicillin remains the treatment of choice.
