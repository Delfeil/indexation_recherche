Age-related changes in men resemble symptoms of hypogonadism. Although the average levels of testosterone decrease with age, correlations between complaints and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low in aging men. This is related to methodological limitations of studies, the high interindividual variability of testosterone in the aging male, ambiguities of normal values, and numerous determinants (e. g., health status, health behavior) on the level of testosterone.
