Polar body analysis is a perfect tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation. This helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction, primarily in advanced maternal age patients. This might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients. Polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal aberration or a mutation before they become pregnant. However, it does not assess the genetic status of the embryo resulting from the oocyte tested and selected. The paternal contribution to the embryo is left unattended. Ethical considerations do not play a role, since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos.
