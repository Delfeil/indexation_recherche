 Purpose: This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of pathological findings on abdominal CT scans in patients with ARDS. Material and methods: CT scans of 92 patients (female 40.2%, mean age: 32 years) with ARDS were analyzed retrospectively. The impact of pathological findings on the course and prognosis was evaluated employing the duration of ventilation, the Lung Injury Score, the need for ECMO, the incidence of multiple organ failure and the overall lethality as measurable parameters. Results: Pathological findings on CT scans were detected in 75 (82%) of 92 patients. Hepatomegaly was the most common finding (n=48, 52%). Free abdominal fluid was detected in 29 (31%) and splenomegaly in 25 (27%) cases. Peritoneal and retro-peritoneal infiltrations as well as bowl wall thickening, dilated bile ducts, and I ° or II ° pancreatitis were less common findings. The overall lethality in patients with pathological findings was about twice as high (23%) as compared to those without (12%). Conclusions: The prevalence of pathological findings on abdominal CT is a reliable indicator of an unfavorable course and outcome in patients with ARDS.
