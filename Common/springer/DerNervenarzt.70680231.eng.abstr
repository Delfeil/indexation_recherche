With the introduction of operationalized diagnostic systems the multiaxial approach became a more important issue. The proposed multiaxial system of ICD-10 consists of three axes: on axis I psychiatric diagnoses are made according to the ICD-10 Clinical Guidelines or Diagnostic Criteria for Research. Axis II (Disability Diagnostic Scale, DDS) deals with impairment of psychosocial functioning. On axis III environmental/circumstantial and personal lifestyle management factors are rated. As part of the WHO international field trial, applicability and inter-rater reliability of the system were examined in seven German-speaking centers. In addition axis II was compared with the corresponding axis of DSM-III-R (Global Assessment of Functioning Scale). 45 German clinicians rated 12 case histories written in English (provided by WHO) with 488 ratings altogether. Diagnoses on axis I with an average percentage agreement of 65.6 % and a mean K of 0.50 showed a moderate inter-rater reliability. For axis II the intraclass coefficient was 0.62, and that for the corresponding DSM-III axis was 0.65: both these axes thus also had a moderate inter-rater reliability. There was a close correlation between the subscales and the global assessment of axis II there was. Wide variation was found in the psychosocial circumstances on axis III, the mean K value being 0.16. In the discussion proposals for the revision process for the multiaxial ICD-10 system are made.
