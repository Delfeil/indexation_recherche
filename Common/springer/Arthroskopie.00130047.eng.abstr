Transplant failure after anterior cruciate ligament plastic surgery is a typical complication. In larger collectives, the amount of revision operations is about 8-12% of the reconstructive anterior cruciate ligament operations. The number of revision operations is also growing in our clinic and is presently 11%. There are different reasons for transplant failure, including: technical faults during the operation, wrong fixation technique, or inadequate postoperative treatment. Rarely is a new "adequate trauma" the cause of a rerupture. The number of revision operations with low-fail positioned drill canals is growing with the improvement of target instruments and the refinement of operation techniques. The fixation method is also very important. Thus, we repeatedly see transplant insufficiencies after Endobutton fixation with enormous drill canal expansion and heavy canal sclerosis. Especially drill canal expansion with great tibial and femoral bone defects, caused by low-fail positioning, lead to serious problems for revision plastic surgery. Appropriate revision surgery is required for these defects, and in these cases, the TransFix technique, if necessary in conjunction with the OATS technique, is a reproducible alternative for immediate revision plastic surgery. Short-term results of the first seven patients operated this way justify this view.
