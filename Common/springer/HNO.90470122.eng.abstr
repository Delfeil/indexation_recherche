Between May 1995 and March 1996 we were able to diagnose and remove glomus tumors of the left nasal cavity from three female patients. Ages of the patients were 9, 36 and 74 years. All patients suffered from a frequent epistaxis and all were extremely sensitive to the slightest nasal touch. One patient reported breathing difficulties due to nasal congestion. Examination revealed a tumor that filled the entire nasal cavity. The method of choice in treatment of these tumors is surgical removal. Hemangiopericytoma, non-chromaffin paraganglioma,  hidradenoma, cavernous hemangioma and nevus cell nevi have to be excluded by histology and immunohistochemical techniques. From a clinical perspective the bleeding  septal polyp (granuloma telangiectaticum sive pyogenicum sive pediculatum) has to be considered because it often comes from Kieselbachi's plexus, has a mushroom-like appearance and bleeds slightly.
