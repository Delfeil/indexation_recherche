Acute renal failure is a common and severe complication in ICU. Renal laboratory examinations like creatinine and urea are late signs of renal dysfunction: Most of the functional abilities are reduced and there is no time for therapeutical interventions. The aim of this study was to find some earlier sensitive parameters of renal dysfunction and the order of appearance, the cause of acute renal failure and the value of the measured parameters.
