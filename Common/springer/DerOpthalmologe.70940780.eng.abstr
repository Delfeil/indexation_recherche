Background: Donor corneas are normally obtained by whole globe enucleation - a procedure often refused by the bereaved. To increase the acceptance of cornea donation, we have exclusively obtained donor corneas by in situ excision since the end of 1994. There have been reports of increased endothelial damage and higher contamination rates. We report our experience in 1995 and 1996.
