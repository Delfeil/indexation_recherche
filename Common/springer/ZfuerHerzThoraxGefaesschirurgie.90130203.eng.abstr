 Primary vascular leiomyosarcoma is a rare soft tissue tumor. In most cases diagnosis is done during or postoperation. The only effective therapy is a radical tumor resection. This is a case report of a patient with a primary leiomyosarcoma of the inferior caval vein with a follow up of about 5 years; usually the overall prognosis is still poor. Diagnosis, therapy and prognosis are discussed. Because no effective adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation is available, diagnosis before operation is important for a radical tumor resection.
