  Recently, as a part of new stent implantation strategy in order to decrease stent thrombosis, final dilatations with high pressure and/or higher sized balloons were applied after the initial deployment of the stent. In this paper, we presented a case of chronic coronary pseudoaneurysm which occured after an initially successful stent implantation in the left anterior descending artery, probably due to high pressure final dilatation.
