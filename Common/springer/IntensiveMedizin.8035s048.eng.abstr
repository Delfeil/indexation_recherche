  Tonometry and hepatovenous oximetry monitor the O2 supply of the gastrointestinal region from different points of view. While tonometry estimates tissue oxygenation of gut mucosa, hepatovenous oximetry measures the global ratio of O2-demand and -consumption of the hepatosplanchnic region without direct relation to the oxygen supply of the mucosa at the cellular level.
