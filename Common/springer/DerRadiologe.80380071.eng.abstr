The primary goal of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is analysis of submucosal structures that are not visible by clinical or endoscopic means. Therefore, image analysis of the larynx should only be performed under knowledge of the results of clinical diagnosis. The anatomic relationships of the laryngeal skeleton, the intrinsic structures, and the surrounding soft tissue are presented synoptically.
