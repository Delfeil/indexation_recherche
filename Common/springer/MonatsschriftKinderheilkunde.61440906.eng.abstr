 Aim of the study was to determine the age-dependent prevalence of antibodies against Bordetella pertussis in children and adolescents not vaccinated against pertussis.  Methods: From March to October, 1994, sera of children and adolescents (1-18 years of age) without a history of pertussis immunization, and treated for non-respiratory illnesses at the University Hospital for Children and Adolescents in Erlangen, were collected and kept frozen. Pertussis antibodies were measured with a microagglutination assay.  Results: Agglutinating serum antibodies against B. pertussis were found in 152 (49.5 %) of 307 patients. Age distribution and seropositivity rates were as follows (age group, n total, % positive): 1-2 years: 29 (21 %); 2-3 years: 19 (21 %); 3-4 years: 21 (24 %); 4-5 years: 29 (45 %); 5-6 years: 31 (48 %); > 6-12 years: 108 (60 %); > 12 years: 70 (63 %). Only 24 (16 %) of 152 seropositive patients had a history of pertussis illness. Antibodies were positive in 24 (73 %) of 33 patients with a positive history for pertussis.  Conclusions: Since the sensitivity of the assay is estimated to be at least 90 % and a positive titer in our experience persists for decades, we conclude: 1) a history of pertussis is unreliable and frequently missing despite positive serum antibodies. In 27 % of patients with a positive history antibodies against B. pertussis were not demonstrable. 2) The rate of susceptibility among unvaccinated children and adolescents was high. Catch-up immunizations, preferably with monovalent, acellular pertussis vaccines are required to stop the circulation of the organism in the population.
