Background. Desmopressin ist frequently used in the treatment of enuresis nocturna. We report the case of a 6 years old enuretic boy, who developed hyponatriemia and cerebral convulsions during desmopressin therapy. Precipitating factors for cerebral complications under desmopressin treatment preferably are diseases with elevated risk of plasma electrolytes imbalances, e. g. gastrointestinal infections, but also high doses of desmopressin or elevated fluid intake.
