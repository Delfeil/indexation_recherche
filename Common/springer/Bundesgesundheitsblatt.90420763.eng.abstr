There are no unequivocal symptoms linked to Influenza and hence diagnosis only considering the clinical picture is uncertain. The predictive value of typical symptoms of Influenza depends largely on the incidence of the infection. Some studies and observations indicate a high predictive value when the epidemic situation is additionally considered. Concepts taking into account the epidemic situation of influenza can enhance the proportion of proper diagnoses and thereby the appropriate use of neuraminidase inhibitors, as supplement to vaccine prophylaxis.
