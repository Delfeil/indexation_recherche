 The promising results achieved with internal atrial defibrillation have facilitated the development of an implantable atrial defibrillator.  For any new therapy, it is imperative to demonstrate safety, efficacy, tolerability with improvement in quality of life, and cost-effectiveness compared to already available therapeutic options. Most importantly, the efficacy and safety rates with a new therapy should be better or at least as good than those observed with previously available means. Maintenance of sinus rhythm or prolonged duration in arrhythmia-free intervals should be clearly demonstrated with an implantable atrial defibrillator, the MetrixTM system. Recently, a new dual-chamber defibrillator (7250 Jewel AF AMD) has entered clinical evaluation. The most important new features of the 7250 AMD system include: dual-chamber pacing, a new dual-chamber detection criterion for rejection of supraventricular tachycardias, detection and treatment modalities of atrial arrhythmias, prevention strategies for atrial arrhythmias. The dual-chamber detection criterion is constantly monitoring the rhythm in the ventricle as well as in the atrium. This new dual-chamber detection algorithm is used to improve discrimination of ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia by applying pattern recognition methods based on different P-wave positions within RR sequences. The detection algorithm can be used to withhold inappropriate ventricular therapies.  Initial clinical experience with the MetrixTM system indicates stable atrial defibrillation thresholds, appropriate R-wave synchronization markers, no shock induced ventricular proarrhythmia, and excellent detection of atrial fibrillation with a specificity of 100%. Ventricular proarrhythmia has not been reported for correctly R-wave synchronized low energy shocks when closely coupled RR intervals and long-short cycles are avoided. The first results with the 7250 Jewel AF device suggest a high sensitivity for induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and an increased specificity for reduction of inappropriate therapies.
