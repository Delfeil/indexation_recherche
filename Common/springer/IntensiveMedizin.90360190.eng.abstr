 With a postal survey we investigated the situation of intensive care medicine in hospitals where pneumologists organized in the German Society of Pneumology (DGP) are employed. Of more than 1600 interviewed 240 responded, representing 145 different hospitals (overall response rate 14.4%). All members of the DGP were questionaired about the type of hospital, the organization, and size of the department of respiratory medicine (independent, semi-independent, or not independent at all) as well as the organization and size of the intensive care units at their respective hospitals. In addition to this the technical resources available were investigated. Even though the fractions of intensive care beds of the total number of respiratory care beds are equal in university hospitals and specialized pulmonary care centers the part of intensive care units that are headed by pneumologists are inadequately low in university (8%) as well as general type hospitals (2%) and even in specialized respiratory care centers (45%) only part of the ICUs are run by pneumologists. In Germany - in contrast to other countries - the existing deficit of respiratory care medicine at university hospitals is reflected in an even aggravated fashion in the lack of involvement in intensive care medicine.
