A 54-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported. Transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease. After many years with only occasional disturbances, a distinct organic brain syndrome developed. Thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis; this was based on the history, liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in CT. Despite the initiation of specific therapy, the patient died of the sequelae of the disease. At autopsy, characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal leptomeningitis were found with collapsed parasitic cysts. Additional intracerebral mesenchymal-glial reactions were less conspicuous. Residual ependymitis had caused aqueductal stenosis. Death was due to cachexia, bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess. The clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed. The disease has become rare in our country, but is globally the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system.
