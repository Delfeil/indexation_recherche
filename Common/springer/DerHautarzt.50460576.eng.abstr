A 34-year-old women had a hen's egg-sized supernumerary mammary gland with no nipple or areola in the left anterior axillary line for the last 8 years. The main complaint about the axillary "lump" was that it was aesthetically displeasing, and it was excised. The importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma. Early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended.
