Clinical experience of 11 patients with CHARGE association is reviewed. The study comprised six girls and five boys. All presented with congenital heart disease. Eight had bilateral choanal atresia. Coloboma affecting either one or both eyes was detected in nine children. Nine patients suffered abnormal pinnae or deafness. In addition to major abnormalities, further anomalies of the orofacial region and the upper airways occurred in all patients. All children exhibited velopharyngeal incoordination and swallowing problems often resulting in recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Three patients had cleft lip and palate. Both micrognathia and high-arched palate were present in two patients. Facial palsy was observed in six patients. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate specialities. The anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible. In our experience, the transpalatal approach is far more satisfactory than the transnasal. It gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair. After the child has grown stronger, a long-term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training.
