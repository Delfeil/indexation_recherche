Neck pain after whiplash injury of the cervical spine often induces typical changes in head motion patterns (amplitude, velocity). These changes of kinematics may help to recognize malingerers. We investigated the hypothesis that malingerers are not able to reproduce their simulated head movement disturbances three times. The kinematics of head movements of 23 patients with neck pain after whiplash injury and of 22 healthy subjects trying to act as malingerers were compared. The healthies were informed about the symptomatology of whiplash injury and were asked to simulate painful head movements. Two different kinds of head movements were registered and analyzed by Cervicomotography: (1) the slow free axial head rotation (yaw) and (2) the axial head rotation (yaw) tracking a moving visual target. Each experimental condition was presented three times, expecting the malingerers not to be able to produce as well as to reproduce the same head movement disturbances again and again. In patients, as a consequence of their distinct pain patterns, we expected less variance between the test repetitions. The statistical analysis showed significant differences of the calculated kinematic parameters between both groups and the inability of healthy subjects to simulate and to reproduce convincingly distinct pain patterns.
