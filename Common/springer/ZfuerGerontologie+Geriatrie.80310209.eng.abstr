  The aim of the present study was to examine the factors responsible for an early or late date for the diagnosis of dementia. In the course of our gerontopsychiatric outpatient department concerning impaired memory ("Gedächtnissprechstunde"), we examined four patients with cognitive impairments and explored their caregivers with regard to the biographic history and the course of the patient's disease.
