Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) is a rare dermatosis of unknown aetiology. Recent electron microscopic studies suggest that CRP is a disorder of keratinisation. In our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings. CRP is generally resistant to therapy. We treated a 19-year-old patient with typical CRP with oral minocycline. Within a few weeks the eruption resolved completely. A mild relapse 7 months later responded promptly to a repeated course of minocycline. Twelve months after discontinuatin of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence. In CRP minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects.
