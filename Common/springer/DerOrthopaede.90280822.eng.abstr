The stability of the carpus is determined by a precise interaction of the osseous and ligamentous elements. The main load of the carpus responsible for the adaptation of concerned tissues is a longitudinal compression caused by the force of the muscles of the forearm with their insertions to the metacarpus and fingers. As a consequence, the proximal row is distracted due to the wedge-shaped form of the hamatum together with the capitatum. It is the function of the mainly oblique orientated ligaments to take these transverse tensional forces, supported by the circular arrangement of the retinacula. Here, the ligaments are described in respect of their precise course into three groups. The distribution of material which is needed for bearing the enormous static and dynamic forces is minimised by the integration in a system of oblique fibre bundles which guaranties that all elements, osseous as well as ligamentous, are involved in the force distribution. This is the prerequisition for the minimalisation of osseous material. On the other hand, damage of only one element can cause severe consequences to the stability of the whole system.
