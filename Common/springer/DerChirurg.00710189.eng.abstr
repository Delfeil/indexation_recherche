Abstract.  Introduction: To compare treatment results an international established classification is necessary. In 1997 the TNM classification of 1992 was modified. Methods: Between 1983 and 1997, 159 patients with a ductal carcinoma of the pancreas underwent resection. All data of the resected specimens were documented in standardized manner prospectively in a protocol that offered ready transfer of the collected data to a new classification. The TNM categories and stage groupings were transferred to the new UICC classification of 1997 and analyzed in comparison to the classification of 1992. Results: The inclusion of a pT4 category equivalent to the other GI tumors made a new stage grouping necessary. Also division into pN1 a and pN1 b was established. According to the clinical experience only few tumors in early stages (pT1/2 and stage I) were observed in the new classification. There was a significant improval in the patient's distribution to the new stage grouping because of the homogeneous groups. In comparison to the 1992 classification the new stage II shows a relevant prognostic value and a significant difference to stage III. Conclusion: We conclude that the new UICC classification relates to prognosis better than the old classification.
