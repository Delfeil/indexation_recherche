In recent years good results after treatment of different superficial corneal pathologies with the excimer laser 193 nm have been reported. Thiel-Behnke dystrophy is a hereditary form of anterior stromal dystrophy, a promising layer for successful phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). This type of dystrophy was first described in 1967 in Kiel.
