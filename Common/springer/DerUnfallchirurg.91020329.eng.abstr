The case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described. This combination of injuries is rather rare and only 25 cases were found in the literature. The sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable, probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule. Immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result.
