Introduction: The pathogenesis of allergic sensitization remains an unsolved mystery. Of considerable interest for this problem are epidemiological observations that maternal age and the number of siblings play an important role in the allergic diathesis. But little is known about the association between maternal age and number of siblings, and the prevalence of allergic sensitization. We hypothesized that despite the association of both factors, maternal age and the number of siblings are independent riks factors for allergic sensitization.
