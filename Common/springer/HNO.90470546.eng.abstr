To achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of attaining a straight and solid septum, even in cases of marked deviations or severe post-traumatic deformities, we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a "compound graft". For this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed, and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are reconnected to each other to form a straight and solid plate. As connecting material we use a polydioxanon (PDS) foil. The sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with PDS suture material. The compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose. The PDS and suture material are usually resorbed within 8 months, excluding long-term complications. During the past 2 years this method was used in treating 38 patients. The surgical goal was attained in every case, and no immediate or long-term complications occurred. This method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better, significant correction of even severe septal deviations.
