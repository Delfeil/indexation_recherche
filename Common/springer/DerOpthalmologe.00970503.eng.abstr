An increasing number of people uses the internet for information retrieval. In the past three years nearly every University Eye Hospital provides ist own information using homepages in the Internet. More and more Eye Departments and comprehensive ophthalmologists use the Internet to provide information on their own. We provide advice for the selection of a provider, use exmples on how to deal with an HTML editor program and explain the technical realisation of the own Internet presence. Legal circumstances and strategies to promote the own homepage are discussed.
