We investigated the technical feasibility and clinical results of bone fixation techniques in combination with needle suspension for correction of female stress urinary incontinence. In our experience the screw-like bone anchor, which is drilled into the pubic tubercle, represents a minimally invasive but very stable and reliable technique. However, the needle suspension fixed to the bone anchor turned out to be critical. Even though the suspension was fixed in the paraurethral tissue with a deep Z-stitch between the bladder neck and the midurethra, the 1-year recurrence rate was 76 %. Our data showed that the suspension sutures pull through the paraurethral tissue because there is no paravesical scar formation as in open procedures. Modifications of the suspension technique (four-point suspension, simultaneous laparoscopic or digital dissection of the paravesical space, combination with sling procedures) revealed significantly improved short-term results. Therefore we conclude that after improvement of the suspension technique the bone anchor will represent a valid option for minimally invasive fixation of a bladder neck suspension.
