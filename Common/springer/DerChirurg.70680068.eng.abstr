 A postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery. Clinical signs, laboratory findings, ultrasound and ERC lead to diagnosis. We report on 40 cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube. In all patients the fistula healed within 7 days after placement of the tube. Two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess, and in 2 patients drainage of a bilioma was performed. In 2 cases with biliary peritonitis, a step-by-step lavage was necessary. The nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract.
