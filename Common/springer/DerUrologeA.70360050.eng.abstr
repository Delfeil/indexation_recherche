A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old woman who had been suffering from interstitial cystitis with Hunner's ulcer for 10 years. Up to now, only 7 cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis have been reported. Although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far, the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation. After conservative management had failed, a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed. The characteristics of interstitial cystitis, verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed.
