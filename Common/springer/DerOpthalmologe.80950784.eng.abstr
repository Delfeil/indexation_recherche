Background: Behçet's disease is a rare systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. The typical symptoms includ recurrent oral and/or genital aphthous lesions, iridocyclitis (historically with hypopyon) and various skin lesions. The number of young adults and children which are diagnosed with Behçet-syndrome is increasing in recent years and the mean age of manifestation has decreased to 25 years in German patients. The disease is generally diagnosed later in German (48.5 months) than in Turkish patients (25.5 months). Ocular manifestation has been confirmed as a marker of severe prognosis. In 15-25 % of affected patients it leads to blindness.
