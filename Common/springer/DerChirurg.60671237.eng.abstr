 Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences. Limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation. In order to evaluate isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion (ILP) in a multimodality therapy concept, we reviewed our patients treated using this method. Between January 1982 and December 1995, 25 ILPs, using cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin, were performed in 22 patients with STS. Forty percent were treated for local recurrences; histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and synovial sarcoma. In all, 68 % of the STS were classified as UICC stage IIb or IIIa/b. Most of the cases (14) underwent wide or radical resection, 4 patients received intraoperative radiotherapy, and 5 were treated with external beam radiation. Complications were recorded in 32 % of the cases. With a median follow-up of 45 months (range 1-143), the 5-year overall survival rate was 81 %. The median recurrence-free time was 19 months and the 5-year disease-free survival rate 34 %. There were 13 local failures, and distant metastases developed in 36 % of the patients. Concerning high-grade sarcomas (UICC stage IIb, IIIa/b), we found local recurrences in 75 % of all cases. Five of 11 patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation, and 7 incompletely resected STS received ILP without reoperation. All of these demonstrated local recurrence. This rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor-free resection margins (p = 0.0001, log-rank test). The amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was 27 % (mean 11 months after treatment). Long-term results of ILP showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease-free survival. Perfusion in patients without tumor-free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence. We conclude that ILP with cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice.
