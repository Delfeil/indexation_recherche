Although the attempts to develop an oxygen-carrying alternative to red blood cells (RBC) have spanned the last 100 years, it has proven difficult to develop a clinically useful haemoglobin-based oxygen carrier. Four major problems have been shown to compromise the use of haemoglobin outside the RBC as an oxygen carrier: (1) the increased oxygen affinity due to the loss of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate; (2) dissociation into dimers and monomers with consequent renal and capillary loss of hemoglobin; (3) insufficient concentrations of prepared solutions under iso-oncotic conditions, and thereby reduced oxygen-carrying capacity; and (4) toxicity. Most of these limitations have been overcome by different modifications of haemoglobin, including pyridoxylation, intra- and intermolecular cross-linking, polymerisation, liposome encapsulation, conjugation to inert macromolecules, and genetic engineering.
