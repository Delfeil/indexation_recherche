We report the case of a seven months old girl, presenting with diarrhea refractory to therapy and stagnation of growth. The dehydrated infant developed edemas. It showed considerable diminution of humoral and cellular immunoresponse. Inspite of several vaccinations there was no response to a multiple-puncture skin test. Thus we suspected a combined immunodeficiency with protein-losing enteropathy, as massive substitution of protein was necessary. An enteral scintigraphy showed an enhancement in the right upper abdomen. During the following laparotomy a 15-cm-segment of the small bowel was resected, as it appeared to be transformed into a cystic lymphoma. Consequently all pathologic findings disappeared.
