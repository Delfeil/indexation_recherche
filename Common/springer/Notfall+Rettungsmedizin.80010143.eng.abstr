To evaluate outcome quality of emergency calls, available data on emergency patients within the EDP systems of the department of emergency medicine of the Klinik am Eichert, Göppingen, have been connected and analyzed via a software interface. The technically feasible process yields insights into the chances of survival and time spent in the hospital. The proportion of emergency patients staying in hospital for one to two days (22.5%) can be used as an indicator for the specificity of the emergency call.
