 Intraoperative transluminal angioplasty (ITA) has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction, fulfils the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years. Whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature, reports on the procedural management of ITA are rare. One of the basic prerequisites of this method is the correct and nontraumatic implantation of the vascular access sheath at the proper location. In the following, the technique of ortho- and retrograde sheath implantation, either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft, is described in detail. By respecting particular standards for sheath introduction, ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ITA can be kept to a minimum. The importance of the chronology of vascular reconstruction to angioplasty is also elucidated. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated. In spite of new developments, including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon, the "ideal" angioplasty access sheath is, as yet, not available.
