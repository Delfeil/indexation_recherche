Substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders, which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy. However reasons are discussed, why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients. Insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency, structural problems, expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in healthprofessionals' perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves. Though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes exhausting, the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing. Diagnosis nowadays is based on the distinction between drug depencency and drug abuse on the one hand and substance induced disorders on the other hand. Readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients. Therapeutic approaches to deal with this promising aspect of psychotherapy are presented. They are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude. They can be easily implemented in different settings. At the end of the first part of this review in- patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined. This will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches.
