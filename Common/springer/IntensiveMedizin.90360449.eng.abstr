 Up to 3% of patients receiving unfractionated heparin develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with sometimes severe thromboembolic complications, the treatment of which is difficult. We report on a patient with gastric carcinoma, who received 5000 IU of unfractionated heparin s.c. tid after having gastrectomy, splenectomy, and partial pancreatectomy. From the 10th postoperative day the platelet count fell to a minimum of 65000/µl on day 21. Complaining of dyspnea and tachycardia, she was diagnosed with stage III bilateral pulmonary embolism complicating heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT II). Treatment with lepirudin (Refludan) did not result in rapid improvement. Therefore, fibrinolysis with alteplase (30 mg of Actilyse) via the pulmonary catheter was instituted, which resulted in a decline of pulmonary arterial pressure to less than 20 mmHg as well as in an improvement of scintigraphy and clinical symptoms. A scintigram performed 4 weeks later showed almost complete reperfusion. The HIPA test was positive. In conclusion, a hemodynamically compromising pulmonary embolism occurring in HIT II can be treated with alteplase as a fibrinolytic agent even after recent major abdominal surgery. In the case presented here the diagnosis might have been obscured by the preceding splenectomy.
