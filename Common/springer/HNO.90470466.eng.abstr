Dendritic cells play an important role within the mucosal immune system of the upper aerodigestive tract. They process exogenous and endogenous antigens and are able to induce a cytotoxic TC/S lymphocyte reaction against tumors. Recently published data indicate that the in vitro application of tumor lysate incubated dendritic cells can provide a defense against melanoma. Before these new therapeutic strategies are available for the therapy of laryngeal cancer, basic studies have to be performed concerning the distribution of dendritic cells and other subpopulations, such as T- and B-lymphocytes and macrophages. In the present study the distribution of these subpopulations were examined within the epithelial and connective tissue compartments ("tumor front") of 20 T2 squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and glottis. The number of dendritic cells was compared with clinical parameters to check whether a high number of dendritic cells could be correlated with a better prognosis. In contrast to T-lymphocytes, results showed that dendritic cells were mainly located within the epithelial compartment of the tumors, their number ranging from 20 cells/mm2 to >700 cells/mm2. By comparing each patient's clinical course with the number of dendritic cells, findings showed that those patients who died within the first postoperative year were characterized by a very small number of dendritic cells within their tumor tissue (<100 cells/mm2). Although the number of patients was low, results indicate that a high number of dendritic cells within tumor tissue suggest a better prognosis.
