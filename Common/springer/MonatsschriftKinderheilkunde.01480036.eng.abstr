Objective: The evaluation of the mastoid view for the neonatal cerebral sonography. Patients and Methods: In 19 preterm infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus sonography through the mastoid fontanelle was performed after standard sonography of the brain through the anterior fontanelle. Results: The mastoid view allows the detection of pathology in the posterior fossa missed by the standard sonography of the brain through the anterior fontanelle. Stranding in the retrocerebellar cistern, clots within the IV. ventricle, and cerebellar hemorrhage were demonstrated by the mastoid view. Further, the aqueduct, the folia cerebelli and the width of the IV. ventricle could be assessed. Conclusion: Standard sonography of the neonatal brain through the anterior fontanelle is not sufficient for the evaluation of the posterior fossa. The mastoid view is an additional approach for the pathology of the posterior fossa and should be performed in all neonates at risk for brain injury.
