 Background: Evidence-based medicine is a popular movement. It claims that decisions on diagnosis and treatment should be based not merely on intuition, personal experience and pathophysiological reasoning, but rather on external evidence from clinical research. It offers a method of systematic literature search combined with a critical appraisal of the findings that can be learned in special teaching programs.   Aim: Discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the approach.   Methods: Critical appraisal of the validity and usefulness of evidence-based medicine, along the lines of its own method.   Results: While every single step of the method of evidence-based medicine is well described and can be learned systematically, the key term "evidence" is vague. There is no automatic method to state evidence, and evidence is in its nature preliminary and less objective than usually assumed. However, although ultimate answers are not to be expected, the systematic strive for the best available evidence may improve medical practice substantially, although a definite proof of this suggestion is outstanding.   Conclusions: Since the alternative to striving for external evidence would be ignorance, evidence-based medicine is mandatory for ethical reasons, and only the best way can be a question of debate. Despite its virtues, evidence-based medicine can be misunderstood and abused for political purposes or aggressive marketing strategies. Such an abuse does definitely not meet the intentions of the creators.
