We report a granulomateus inflamatory reaction after administration of absorbable interference-fit screws for fixation of patellar-tendon-autograft in anterior-cruciate-ligament reconstruction, leading to spontaneous fracture of the tibia. Radiological evaluation demonstrated osteolytic lesions at the interference-fit screw insertion-site. Histological findings included a sterile inflamatory reaction and gigant-cell formation.
