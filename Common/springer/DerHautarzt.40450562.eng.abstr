Abstract.  A 62-year-old female patient presented with bullous, intensely itching cutaneous lesions, which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease). Therapy with DADPS was unsuccessful. Because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly, a lymph node biopsy was taken. Histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis: angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-type T-cell lymphoma. Intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma. These skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations. This case report is the first report of AILD with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature.
