 A phlebological report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology. The most important, reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic phlebodynamometry and ascending pressure phlebography, as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made. Additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour- coded duplex sonography. A thrombophilic condition should always be investigated in terms of haemotasis. In patients with severe post-thrombotic disease, a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with, and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and, if possible, dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination. There is currently no generally valid schematization of the post-thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion. When evaluating patients, we largely follow our own new classification, which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis.
