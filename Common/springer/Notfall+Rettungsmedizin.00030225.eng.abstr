In the underlying study we present the experience of 1059 transports with the intensive care transportation vehicle "Saar", performed during its 2 years of duty. An earthbound intensive care transportation system can sufficiently manage a distribution territory of 2.500 km2 with a population of one million inhabitants. A central location with an appropriate surrounding is important for its full utilisation and rapidity. Also the distance to hospitals with maximal intervention facilities and cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery and neurosurgery services should be taken into consideration. Most transports with this system are attributed to the emergency rescue system, rather than patient transportation. Similar to the primal rescue the parallel existence of competing systems leads to a decrease in efficiency with an irresponsible increase in costs. The rescue coordinator needs a clearly structured catalogue of indications to decide which system of intensive care transportation is needed, considering acuteness of event and travel distance. A maximum of one hour prior to arrival of the vehicle at the hospital handing in the pre-treated patient can be tolerated.
