We report on a 65-year-old man who was sent to our clinic with osteomyelitis of the hip combined with a chronic external fistula after hip joint replacement followed by several further operations including amputation of the leg. After complete removal of the fistula and repeated vacuum sealing of the wound, we used a vasculated glutaeus maximus muscle flap to close the defect. The course after the operation was without any complications. The method applied led to sufficient treatment of the osteomyelitis without weakening the trunk muscles or rendering the use of crutches more difficult.
