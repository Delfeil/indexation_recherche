Desflurane is a new volatile anaesthetic with an extremely low blood/gas partition coefficient of 0.42. This should provide a rapid recovery from anaesthesia. Methods. We studied 100 adult patients, ASA class I or II, undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery randomly assigned to anaesthesia with desflurane (n=50) or isoflurane (n=50) supplemented by nitrous oxide in oxygen. Clorazepat was given for premedication, fentanyl and thiopental for induction of anaesthesia, followed by maintenance with desflurane or isoflurane as clinically appropriate. Emergence from anaesthesia was measured as well as return of cognitive functions (extended Aldrete score, digit symbol substitution test, and visual analogue scales [VAS]). Results. While the demographic characteristics and administrated doses of fentanyl and thiopental were comparable, the recovery profiles in both groups were different. After discontinuation of the volatile anaesthetics, times to extubation and ability to follow simple commands were significantly shorter after desflurane than after isoflurane. Extended Aldrete scores, estimation of the patients' physical condition, results of the digit symbol substitution test, measuring cognitive functions, and rates of drowsiness and weakness on VAS showed better recovery with less impairment of cognitive function in the desflurane group than in isoflurane patients even 120 min after anaesthesia. VAS pain scores and doses of analgesic drugs given within the first 2 postoperative hours, however, showed no significant differences. Desflurane patients were also judged fit for discharge from the recovery room significantly faster. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that desflurane anaesthesia, even when supplemented by premedication, intraoperative opioids, and nitrous oxide may offer clinical advantages over isoflurane as far as the post-anaesthetic recovery profile is concerned.
