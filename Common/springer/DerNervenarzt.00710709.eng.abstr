The doctrine of informed consent has become a legal and ethical standard in psychiatry today. However, ethical problems arise if patients lose the capacity to give informed consent due to their psychiatric disorders. Particularly in the field of psychiatry, the assessment of competence of informed consent to medical treatment and participation in clinical trials is a controversial issue. New empirical data suggest that a high percentage of psychiatric patients are incompetent according to defined standards for assessing their capacity to make treatment decisions. Assessing competence according to a sliding scale integrates the ethical principles of autonomy and beneficence and provides help in assessing competence in clinical practice.
