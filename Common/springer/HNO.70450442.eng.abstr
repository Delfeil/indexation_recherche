Animal experiments with microbiologic examinations and studies in cell cultures have shown that ionomer cement is a biocompatible and biostable bone replacement material in the head and neck region. Clinical and functional results of its use in the human middle ear have proven to be satisfactory during a maximal period of 2.5 years observation. The present trial was continued in order to determine the long-term behavior of ionomer cement (Ionos partial and total ossicles) after reconstruction of the ossicular chain. The ossicular chain was reconstructed in 343 cases and included various losses of one or more of the ossicles (i.e., incus, incus and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure, and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure). Follow-up extended over a maximum period of 5.5 years. Patients were examined under a surgical microscope and a pure-tone audiogram was performed at regular intervals.
