For low-back pain different analgesic and adjuvant drugs are available. In accordance to the special pathophysiology and stage of disease unwanted side-effects and contraindications of each drug have to be taken into consideration. Mainly the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory as well as the non-acid antipyretic drugs are in use. During episodes of acute pain the short-term application of central acting opioids or myotonolytic drugs can be neccessary. In long-lasting therapies for chronic low-back pain a medication with antidepressants is recommended. Supporting the primarily indicated therapeutic modalities pharmacologic therapy enables to an early painfree mobilisation. This is still the best prevention against further chronification.
