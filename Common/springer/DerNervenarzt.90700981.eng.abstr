Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively disconcerting convictions with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder. The perceptions from which delusions arise are dynamically charged according to their role in the structural context. The realisation pressure that burdens the perceptions and is intensified in psychotic constitutions is a precondition for the delusion. The failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic disorganisation of the structure is also a requirement. Based on a case study, considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification.
