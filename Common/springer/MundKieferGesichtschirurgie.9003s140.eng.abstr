Distraction osteogenesis using external or intraoral devices is an established method for lengthening the human mandible. In this preliminary study on sheep, a completely implanted device for mandibular lengthening is presented. After osteotomy of the mandible, the electromechanical device was fixed to the mandible and the power and control unit were inserted subcutaneously in the neck region. After a healing period of  5 days, the device was activated magnetically and allowed calibrated distraction steps of 0.04 mm/h, achieving a total of 1.0 mm per day. With this method, it was possible to lengthen the mandible automatically over a period of  14 days without transmucosal activation. In our study, this newly designed internal device was successfully used for distraction osteogenesis, and a maximum mandibular lengthening of 13.6 mm was achieved. Further research is necessary to achieve progression to human clinical application in the near future.
