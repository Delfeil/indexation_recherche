Background: Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe, potential vision-threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment. In general, any therapy has been dis-cussed controversially in the literature. Based upon experiences with spinal cord trauma, high-dose steroid therapy is recommended initially to minimize secondary consequences following orbital trauma. The usefulness of surgical decompression of the optic nerve has been confirmed in several studies but is still not recommended in principle.
