The loudness perception of patients with hearing aids was measured with a one-stage category loudness scaling procedure. Data were obtained from 102 ears and were studied primarily in older patients who represented the majority of patients with hearing disorders evaluated in our department. In all, 75% of the patients were older than 45 years and had a mean age of  58 years. The reduction of dynamics at high frequencies was considered to be typical for age-related hearing disorders and was easily quantified with loudness scaling. Findings demonstrated that prediction of recruitment was not possible from pure-tone thresholds or even together with uncomfortable loudness levels, since the slopes of the level-loudness functions revealed a high inter-individual variability. In contrast, the desired compression ratio can be easily calculated with data from the loudness scaling. In this study the loudness perception of patients with mainly non-linear hearing aids fitted with customary procedures was evaluated. The benefit from the hearing aids was proven with the outcome from the loudness scalings, with testing also allowing for a better fitting of the aids.
