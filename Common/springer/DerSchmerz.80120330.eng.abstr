Introduction: Former studies performed by means of supravital methylene blue (MB) staining could demonstrate intraepidermal free nerve fiber endings (FNE). Unfortunately, these publications were only illustrated by drawings. Furthermore, the practical details of the method were only insufficiently handed down to the posteriority. Therefore, a modification of the staining procedure should be worked out for this purpose. Subsequently, the possible advantages of the method compared with common histochemical techniques should be clarified. Regarding the possible nociceptive functions of the FNE, the corresponding conclusions should be drawn from the results.
