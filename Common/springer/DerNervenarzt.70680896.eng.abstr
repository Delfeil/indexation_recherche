Evaluation of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment frequently uses rating scales without regard for patients' defensiveness. This study demonstrates on 309 psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy and followed-up 1 year after treatment that defensiveness, measured with validity scales of personality inventories MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gieﬂen-Test, influences ratings (scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES) before and after therapy. Patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up. The extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in frankness in these patients, indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales. Inpatient client-centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self-criticism and diminished it in the case of initial retentiveness.
