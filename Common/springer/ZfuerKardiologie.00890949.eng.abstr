 The cardiovascular interstitial space is largely composed of type I and III fibrillar collagens. Tissue structure, form and function are determined not only by the collagen content but also by the ratio of different collagens to each other. Matrix metalloproteinases are members of a family of secreted and membrane-bound enzymes that are capable of degrading highly proteolytic resistant fibrillar type I and III collagens. Collagen tissue content is determined by balanced collagen synthesis and degradation. MMP activity and adverse tissue remodeling have been identified in coronary plaques in unstable angina. It has also been linked with the progression of aortic aneurysms and with left ventricular dilatation in congestive heart failure in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. The role of MMPs in these cardiovascular diseases and possible therapeutic options are the focus of this review.
