Between January 1994 and August 1998, 12 patients with 13 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis muscleflap. One patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides. In all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection. The average duration of infection was 8.3 months. The patients had undergone an average of 3.8 operations. Up to now there was no recurrent infection, controlled by clinical investigation, ultrasound and laboratory findings in all 13 cases. Follow up investigation occured 2.5 years (1.5-4.7) after flap transfer. The flap is easy to harvest. He has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation. The functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal. That vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region.
