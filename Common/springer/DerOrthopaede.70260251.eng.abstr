Computer-guided robot-assisted surgery in cementless total hip replacement requires exact preoperative planning at the 3D workstation Orthodoc. Only the Robodoc procedure allows the precise execution of the preoperative plan in surgery. Robot-assisted surgery has been undergoing clinical evaluation at the Berufsgenossenschaftliche Unfallklinik, Frankfurt, since November 1994. In all 465 patients, the preoperative plan was successfully carried out intraoperatively. The high precision in reaming, leading to a superb bone implant contact, guarentees absolute initial stability and is likely to promote primary healing between implant and bone. The common and often published incidence of varus or valgus malpositioning and any fractures or fissures could be avoided through the use of Robodoc. Although immediate full-weight bearing was strongly recommended to the patients, no implant subsidence was seen in the regular follow-up X ray studies.
