  Quantitative tissue Doppler echocardiography is a new diagnostic approach to left ventricular systolic performance. The aim of the present study was to validate a recently developed method based on the computer software TDI-Labor enabling a variable time and space related measurement of regional wall velocity from tissue Doppler images. Therefore, in 63 volunteers the mean velocity of a 2 mm thick subendocardial slice during the systolic ejection period was determined from frozen Doppler M-mode images of the left ventricular posterior wall obtained using the left parasternal window. The same images were employed for comparative measurement of the mean endocardial velocity using the conventional M-mode slope approach. Tissue Doppler data of the subendocardial wall velocity were found to correspond closely to the mean endocardial wall velocity (y = 0.97x + 0.17; r = 0.77; p < 0.0001). The average wall motion gradient of the population was 1.33  +/-  0.35. Wall motion velocity and wall motion gradient were shown to be not age dependent.
