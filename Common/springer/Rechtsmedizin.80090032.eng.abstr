 Two cases where DNA typing has been carried out for stain analysis are described. In both cases Y chromosomal STR systems have been used in combination with autosomal STR systems. In the first case the DNA from the fingernails of a female victim with skin particles of the male murderer was typed. The male DNA in this mixture of male and female DNA could be typed. The excess of female DNA in the samples did not distrub the PCR reaction of Y-chromosomal systems. In the second case several body parts could be identified to belong to a single male person. The typing of the suspect's DNA did not give any information because of a family relationship. Different kinds of stains have been analysed with DYS 389 I/II, DYS 390, DYS 391, DYS 392 DYS 393 and DYS19. Two multiplex PCR reactions were carried out to save time and stain material. Although the Y-chromosomal systems are not as polymorphic as autosomal STR systems the analysis of combined haplotypes can give additional information in forensic casework.
