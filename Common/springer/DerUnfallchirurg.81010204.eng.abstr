The endoscopic single incision technique for ACL reconstruction with a femoral half-tunnel may lead to a graft/tunnel mismatch and subsequent protrusion of the block from the tibial tunnel. The typical tibial fixation with an interference screw is not possible in these cases. Fixation with staples in a bony groove inferior to the tunnel outlet can be used as an alternative technique. Current literature does not provide biomechanical data of both fixation techniques in a human model. This study was performed to evaluate primary biomechanical parameters of this technique compared to a standard interference screw fixation of the block. 55 fresh-frozen human cadaver knee joints of a younger age (mean age: 44 years) were used. Grafts were harvested from the patellar tendon midportion with bone blocks of 25 mm length and 9 mm width. A 10 mm tibial tunnel was drilled from the anteromedial cortex to the center of the tibial insertion of the ACL. 3 different sizes of interference screws (7 x 30, 9 x 20 and 9 x 30 mm) were chosen as a standard control procedure (n = 40). For tibial bone-block fixation the graft was placed through the tunnel, the screw was then inserted on the cancellous or the cortical surface respectively. 15 knees were used for staple fixation. A groove was created inferior to the tunnel outlet with a chisel. The bone block was fixed in this groove with 2 barbed stainless steel staples. Tensile testing in both of the groups was carried out under axial load parallel to the tibial tunnel in a Zwick-testing-machine with a velocity of 1 mm/sec. Dislocation of the graft and stiffness were calculated at 175 N load. Maximum load to failure using interference screws varied between 506 and 758 N. Load to failure using staples was 588 N. Dislocation of the graft ranged between 3.6 and 4.7 mm for interference screw fixation and was 4.2 mm for staples. With both fixation techniques, the recorded failure loads were sufficient to withstand the graft loads which are to be expected during the rehabilitation period. Staple fixation of the bone block outside of the tunnel resulted in fixation strength comparable to interference screw fixation.
