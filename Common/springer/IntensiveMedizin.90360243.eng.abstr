 Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers. The efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to O2 transport and especially the effective O2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations, such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock. The hemoglobin molecule could be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications. This results in a clinically utilizable intravascular half-life of about 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity, and a lack of nephrotoxicity. A degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here. In spite of this, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans. Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are, therefore, well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2. The capacity for the release of O2 to the tissues is especially excellent. This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation. Perflubron, the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in man and is well tolerated. The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients. Launch is expected within the next few years.
