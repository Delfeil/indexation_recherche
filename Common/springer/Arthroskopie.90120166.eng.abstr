The object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid-term and long-term follow-up. During the period from January 1980 to June 1997 we performed 247 open (technique: 134 according to Eden-Hybbinette-Lange, 46 according to Weber, 26 according to Putti-Platt, 41 according to Bankart) and 76 arthroscopic (transglenoidal Morgan technique) shoulder stabilization procedures. The mean follow-up for techniques was: Eden-Hybbinette-Lange 11.1 years (2.9-16.7 years), Weber 5.2 years (2.1-13.0 years), Putti-Platt 7.2 years (2.2-10.6 years), Bankart 1.6 years (0.5-3.2 years), and Morgan 3.5 years (2.8-5.1 years). We observed that the classic open Bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation, range of motion, sports activity, and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures. The results shows that nonanatomical, reconstructive, open procedures are not up to date. The open Bankart procedure reconstructs the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only. The classic open Bankart procedure seems to be the "gold standard" in open shoulder surgery today. The high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more stringent patient selection in the future.
