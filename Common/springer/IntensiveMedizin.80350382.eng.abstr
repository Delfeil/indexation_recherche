 Abnormal bleeding has long been recognized as a common and potentially serious complication of acute and chronic renal failure of different etiologies. Both vascular and platelet abnormalities seem to concur to the bleeding diathesis in chronic uremia. Dialysis and the modern management of renal failure have considerably reduced the occurrence of severe hemorrhages in patients with chronic uremia; at present the major bleeding manifestations consist in ecchymoses, epistaxis, and, only occasionally, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemopericardium, or subdural hematoma. Bleeding can still occur as a severe complication following surgery or biopsy. This review will first analyze the causes of uremic bleeding and will then discuss the therapeutic intervention.
