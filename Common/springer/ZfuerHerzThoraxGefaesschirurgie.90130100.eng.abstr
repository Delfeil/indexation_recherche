 This is the case report of a 38 year old prison patient, who over a period of a couple of years inserted five iron wires into his chest with the intention of committing suicide. The first three wires, which were inserted in 1993, had been left in situ without clinical problems, but the more recently inserted wires necessitated surgical intervention as a result of the patient developing pericardial tamponade and pneumothorax. Wires were removed from the left ventricle (two wires), the right ventricle (one wire), and the left lung (two wires) after thoracotomy (median sternotomy) with the use of the extracorporal circulation (heart-lung machine). The patient was removed after a short stay on the surgical ward. He was hemodynamically stable and exhibited no signs of infection necessitating further surgical intervention.
