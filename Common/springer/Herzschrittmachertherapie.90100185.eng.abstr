 There are different causes for the variable extent of preexcitation in patients with the WPW syndrome. The appearance of an ectopic atrial rhythm is rarely the reason for a temporary complete loss of delta waves in the ECG. This setting does not lead to identification of patients at risk with preexcited atrial fibrillation. However, in some patients with symptomatic arrhythmias the estimation of antegrade conduction properties of the accessory pathway does not require the performance of an electrophysiologic study. In the present case of a patient with intermittent preexcited atrial fibrillation, pharmacological therapy in contrast to radiofrequency catheter ablation of the accessory pathway seems to be suitable, because of slow conduction over the bypass tract and infrequent episodes of arrhythmias.
