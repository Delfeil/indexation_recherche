The discussion of the Osheroff vs Chestnut Lodge court case in the "American Journal of Psychiatry" raised the question whether individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is the appropriate treatment for severe depression. A summary of the crucial points and a review of the clinical and scientific implications of this case is presented. In addition, the difference between psychiatrists and psychotherapists regarding the assessment of depressive disorders is examined by analysing results of the ICD-10 research criteria study. In the case of one patient with dysthymia (ICD-10 RC: F34.1) psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists. By contrast, the percentage of clinicians suspecting an endogenous etiology and thus, diagnosing a psychosis and starting a psychopharmacotherapy was markedly higher among psychiatrists. In conclusion, the integration of different conceptualizations and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists. For certain patients, an integrated therapy may be more effective.
