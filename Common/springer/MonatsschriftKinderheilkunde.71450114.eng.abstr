We report the case of a seven year old girl presenting with varicella infection 14 days after kidney transplantation. Cramp-like abdominal pain and a subileus were the first symptoms. Enemas did not relieve the symptoms, and the following laparotomoy with Tenckhoff catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities. Two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed. Further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella-zoster virus was isolated from their fluid. Despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella-zoster immune globulin further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy. The patient died 18 days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure.
