Of all macroreplantations, reattachment of a leg amputated at the proximal thigh presents the biggest difficulty. A patient with no other injuries was treated in this way. A critical discussion of indications in general, the technique in the acute setting, and reconstructive procedures, including the Ilizarov distraction technique, is presented. The outcome after 2.5 years is gratifying. The results obtainable in proximal thigh replantation can justify the risk of potentially lethal general complications.
