A digitised three-dimensional (3-D) image of the face has many valuable uses. These include accurate measurements of facial morphology, clinical documentation and objective analyses of surgical procedures. A new system presented here, based on stereophotogrammetric techniques, instantaneously captures digitised images using high-resolution cameras. It has an accuracy of more than 0.5 mm RMS and creates the 3-D image from approximately 20,000 points. The principles of the image capturing are demonstrated and the potential uses discussed. Surgical changes of the soft tissue in two patients following orthognathic surgery are also illustrated. This new capturing and measurement system provides a simple method of determining 3-D changes in soft tissue following surgery and is a useful tool for clinical purposes.
