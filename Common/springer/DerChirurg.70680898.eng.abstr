 An often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication, mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care, is reactive acute cholecystitis. On account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis. Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively, seven times on different days, in each of 40 artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of 12 months. The results show that artificial respiration, parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to tardive (28/40) wallthickening or to a three-layered wall of the gallbladder (9/40). In 22.5 % of patients (9/40) we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis. In correlation with the clinical signs, cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients. The preoperative ultrasonographic findings and clinical signs of 23 patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively. We found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in 21 of these 23 patients. Our study shows that the morphological correlate of a thickened three-layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations, even if there is no underlying cholecystitis. The diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings.
