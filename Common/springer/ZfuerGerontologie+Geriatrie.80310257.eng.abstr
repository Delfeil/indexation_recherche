  Using the diary method, the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed. Positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood. Duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities. A total of 55 elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least 50 days. The data were analyzed interindividually (using regression analyses) and intraindividually (using time series analyses). While positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter- and intraindividual perspective, there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.
