Background: Acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a selflimiting lymphoproliferative disease of EBV-infected (immortalised) B cells and poly-/oligoclonal cytotoxic T cells which are to a high percentage EBV-specific. In B cells EBV infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of EBV nuclear antigens 1-6 (EBNA1-6) and membrane antigens 1, 2A and 2B (LMP1, LMP2A and LMP2B). Expression of these EBV latent antigens leads to transformation and immortalisation of infected B cells. Here we examined if also lytic EBV genes (i.e. BZLF1), which are associated with a productive EBV infection, are expressed during IM.
