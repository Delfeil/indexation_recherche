Androgenetic alopecia is the most common form of hair loss in men and women. Although clinically different, the pathogenetic pathways leading to this type of hair loss are similar in both sexes. Recent experimental data enable us to explain some pathogenetic steps suggesting a pivotal role of type 2 5-reductase in the pathogenesis of androgenetic hair loss. In this review our current knowledge about the pathophysiology and treatment options of androgenetic alopecia is summarized.
