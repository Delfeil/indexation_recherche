 Gastritis caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide. There are data on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and histology of this disease that show that Helicobacter pylori gastritis plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis. However, we must remember that only a very few among those infected with Helicobacter pylori will develop gastric cancer. Hence, one of the main targets of future research will be to identify individuals who carry a greater risk for developing gastric cancer and may therefore benefit from eradication of Helicobacter pylori in terms of gastric cancer prevention.
