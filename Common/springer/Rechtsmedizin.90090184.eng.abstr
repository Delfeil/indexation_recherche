 The chemical synthesis of alkyl glucuronides, which appear as metabolites in urine after the consumption of beverages containing congeners of ethanol, is described. Glucuronides of the following alcohols were synthesized: methanol, d5-ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, R-(-)-2-butanol, S-(+)-2-butanol, isopentanol and S-(-)-2-methylbutanol. The retention indices of acetyl, pentafluorpropyl (PFP) and trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives are given and discussed in relation to the chemical structures. Mass spectra of homologous derivatives were shown to be very similar but some fragments were specific for the chain length of the alkyl moiety and can be used for identification and a quantitative estimation of glucuronides in urine samples.
