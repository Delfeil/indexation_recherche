Hyperhidrosis is due to an overfunction of eccrine glands (triggered by the autonomous nervous system) and may be a cofactor for palmoplantar eczema (dermatitis). Tapwater iontophoresis was used in 54 patients with hyperhidrosis manuum et pedum. After 10 applications directed by the dermatologist, 89% of patients noted an improvement in their hyperhidrosis. 20 patients suffering from palmoplantar eczema (dermatitis) who continued the treatment at home for at least 6 months were compared with a historical sex- and age-matched group of 20 eczema-patients without iontophoresis: The factors evaluated were the time needed for clearing and the relapse-free interval. Though iontophoresis-treated patients had a slightly faster clearing, this was statistically not significant (20 vs. 22.3 days; p >0.05). However, the difference for relapse-free interval between the two groups was statistically highly significant (24.8 weeks vs. 8.35 weeks; p<0.0001).Tapwater iontophoresis seems to be effective not only to control sweating. According to recently published data, galvanization seems to have a capsaicin-like effect as well. Our hypothesis is therefore, that galvanization with tapwater iontophoresis interrupts the neurogenic inflammation and prolongs the relapse-free interval in hyperhidrotic palmoplantar eczema (dermatitis).
