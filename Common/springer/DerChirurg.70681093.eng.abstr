 The treatment of knee joint injuries has seen marked development in the last few years. The surgical trauma of intra-articular fracture reconstruction has been reduced significantly. Retrograde nailing, percutaneous plating and specific exposures to distal femur and proximal tibia fractures have been established. Percutaneous osteosynthesis controlled by arthroscopy or fluoroscopy is widely used for B-fractures of the tibial plateau. Injectable bone mineral cement adds to reduced trauma of surgical treatment of these fractures. In all knee ligament procedures, arthroscopy is obligatory for diagnosting and conducting meniscus surgery. Ligament reconstruction should be performed either arthroscopically or by a limited arthrotomy, the results being comparable at present.
