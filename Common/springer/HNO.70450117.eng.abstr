A safe closure of a dura lesion is necessary on account of the risk of potentially fatal (late) meningitis. 161 duraplasties of the frontal skull base carried out from 1979 to 1994 at the ENT-department Fulda were evaluated in a retrospective study in regard to etiology, operative techniques and results. Duraplasty of the rhinobasis was indicated in 70 cases of rhinobasal trauma, 47 cases after paranasal sinus surgery, 36 cases of tumors and 8 malformations. After an average follow-up time of 6 years the patients were interviewed for postoperative liquorrhea, sinusitis treated with antibiotics and meningitis. As an objective measure to verify the tight closure of the treated CSF-leaks a fluoreszein test was performed in 50,9 % 6 to 8 weeks after the operation. Duraplasty was successfull in more than 96 %. The approach and technique to perform a duraplasty have to be choosen individually considering size, location and etiology of the dural defect. In the majority of dural defects in the area of the frontal skull base reconstruction can be carried out now a days via an endonasal approach. By use of allogenic tissue, a mucosal flap from the surrounding area to cover the graft and fibrin clue good results were obtained.
