The relationsship between the growth of tumors and the expression of the protooncogen Bcl-2 could be shown in epithelial tumors. A bcl-2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis. The potential meaning of bcl-2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown. The fact, that the heterogenous group of osteosarkoma is not sufficiently characterized at present, suggested to investigate the bcl-2 expression in osteosarcoma. Thus, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 47 specimens of different osteosarcomas of 36 patients. Sixteen cases (46 %) showed a strong expression of bcl-2 and 13 cases (35 %) were moderately positiv for bcl-2. Seven cases (19 %) were negative for bcl-2. The heterogenous, negative up to strong expression of bcl-2 yield clues, that the Bcl-2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics. Additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the monoklonal antibody MIB 1, directed against the Ki-67 epitop. The data of bcl-2 expression and cellular proliferationrate lead to a classification correlating with the histological classification. To verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether Bcl-2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma, further investigations will be needed.
