Standard curative therapy in head and neck cancer, especially in oral cavity carcinoma, consists, so far, of surgery. Until today, chemotherapy using standard drugs has failed to be effective beyond controlling cancer manifestations and palliation of symptoms. The introduction of chemotherapy and radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment, however, may improve overall survival and curative options. A multicentric randomized trial, initiated by DÖSAK, has compared results after radical surgery alone with results of combined preoperative radio-chemotherapy followed by radical surgery. The life table analysis substantiated improved survival rates in the group of patients whose treatment included chemotherapy and radiation.
