A prospective study of 24 operative procedures involving minimal invasive techniques and fluoroscopic guidance was undertaken in order to measure the radiation exposure to the primary surgeon. Radiation was monitored with the use of high sensitive thermoluminescent dosimeters. At the spots of dosimetry (eyes, thyreoid gland, hand and genitals under lead apron) the dose was uniformly low and ranged from 0,6 µSv at the eyes to 259,3 µSv at the hand. The dose is determined by the duration of fluoroscopy and the amount of scattered rays, which in turn depends on the volume being x-rayed. On the basis of our results there is no likelihood of exceeding the limits of safety regulations even in a very busy operative environment, although a statistically increased incidence of thyreoid cancer or a radiation-induced glaucoma is present. In vitro measurements with irradiation of a phantom resulted in the following recommendations: 1) fluoroscopy should be performed using the magnification-mechanism of the x-ray apparatus, 2) during lateral fluoroscopy the primary surgeon should be positioned close to the image intensifier. At least the surgeon should be familiar with the technique of closed reduction and instrumentation to reduce the duration of fluoroscopy which proved to be the most important factor for the amount of the radiation exposure.
