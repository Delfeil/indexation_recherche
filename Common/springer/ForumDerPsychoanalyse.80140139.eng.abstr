 Classical insight therapy, derived from Freud, and `maternal' holding therapy, derived from Balint, Winnicott and others, are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis. The authors believe that each of these two techniques presupposes specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings. The position of Freud is that of the basically traumatic character of human experience. The contra-position of the object relation psychologists stipulates the priority of love in human experience. These assumptions seem to be more latent than overt guidelines of therapeutical techniques and therefore their reconstruction and reformulation have important implications for psychoanalytical therapy.
