 Antibodies to double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA, dsDNA-Ab) are frequently found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially during active disease and differ with respect to immunoglobulin class and avidity. The detection of anti-dsDNA is one of the diagnostic criteria for SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Most of the commercial ELISA test systems have great advantages in routine laboratory testing but often detect dsDNA-Ab which are not specific for SLE and therefore give false positive results for non-SLE patients.
