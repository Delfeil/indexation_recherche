Abstract  13 experienced addiction therapists provid-ed information about trauma experiences and comorbidity of 122 clients (26 women and 96 men) with opiate addiction and multiple substance abuse. 42% had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men. The victimization primarely took place during childhood and prior to the begin of drug consumption. 26% of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder. In comparison with individuals without trauma experiences, victims evidenced significantly more comorbid symptoms, they more frequently suffered from polytoxicomania and had more experiences with psychotherapy.
