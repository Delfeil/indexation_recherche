 This article reviews recent developments in public policies towards older workers in the United Kingdom. In the last decade, against a background of population ageing, tightening labour markets and a recognition that older workers face barriers in the labour market, successive UK governments have begun to implement policies aimed at increasing labour force participation rates among this group. These have included education campaigns encouraging the recruitment and retention of older workers by firms and assistance and guidance aimed at helping older workers to obtain training and to make decisions about returning to work. The impact of these policies is discussed and proposals for developments in policies are set out.
