Lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally, bilaterally or in combination with other craniosynostoses. Using the concept of fronto-orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis. The process involves striped transversal osteotomy, removal, remodelling and advancement of the occipital region. It allows precise, reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments. Artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy. The remodelling leads to a well-proportioned skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume. This article presents the operative method and the results of 14 patients.
