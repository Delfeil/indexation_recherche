 A 63 year old woman developed painful, up to 15x7cm large ulcers on both lower limbs and an acral necrosis on the right big toe. The patient had no symptoms of intermittent claudication, but a history of 40 package years of cigarette smoking. Angiography showed circumscript stenosis of medium-sized vessels, deformed vessel segments, and rarification and obstruction of peripheral vessels. Arterial occlusive disease was diagnosed, and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the right common iliac artery and both femoral arteries performed. However, despite documented patency of these vessels clinical symptoms worsened. The consulting rheumatologist found a history of Raynaud's syndrome, acral necrosis of the fourth finger of the right hand, sclerodactylia, and microstomia. Capillaroscopy revealed megacapillaries and vessel rarification. High titers of antinuclear antibodies with specificity for centrosomes (1:10240), which have not been described in this context to date, were detected and limited systemic sclerosis of the CREST type was diagnosed. Treatment with iloprost (50µg/day i.v.) and pulsed cyclophosphamide (800mg i.v./month) resulted in almost complete healing of the crural and digital ulcers and a significant reduction of the analgetic medication.
