Although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer, randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates. All randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage III and IV disease. In our opinion, this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials (maximum 18%). Frei et al. estimate that a 40%-50% complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen. To date, such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been attainable in resectable T2-T3, N0-N2 disease. Therefore, we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages. Patients (pts) were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin/5-FU prior to surgery and radiotherapy (arm A, 70 pts) or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy (arm B, 74 pts). Patients were classified according to primary tumour site and neck disease. The observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer (CR: 43%, PR: 37%, NR: 15%, PD: 5%). After a follow-up of 12-96 months overall survival was 58% in arm A and 45% in arm B (n.s.). Disease-free survival in arm A (61%) is statistically significantly better than in arm B (43%, P=0.03). Therefore, we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and tonsils and stage T2-T3 and N0-N2 disease prior to surgery.
