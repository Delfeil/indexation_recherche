  Attachment representation was assessed in 48 elderly people with an average age of 69 years. The adult attachment interview was used plus an additional question about wishes for the future. Coherent correlations with subjective life satisfaction and individual future perspective were demonstrated. Elderly participants with secure attachment representation were more satisfied, they were also less anxious, and more often positive about their future. If their adult children had secure attachment representation, they were reported by their elderly parents to be socially, emotionally, and materially more supportive.
