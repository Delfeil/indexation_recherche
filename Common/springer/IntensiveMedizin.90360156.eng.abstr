 Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation provides effective ventilatory support for many patients with acute respiratory failure and avoids the risks and side effects of endotracheal intubation. Controlled clinical studies demonstrate improved outcome and cost effectiveness for patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The data on use of noninvasive ventilation for other forms of acute respiratory failure are less clear, but justify a consideration of mask ventilation in many clinical situations. Noninvasive ventilation tends to be more time-consuming and more dependent on experienced ICU staff than conventional mechanical ventilation. It is essential for the success of this "new" therapy that physicians and nursing staff try to become familiar not only with the technique but also with a different approach to mechanical ventilation.
