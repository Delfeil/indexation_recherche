 This paper starts with the insight that today's intervention gerontology provides a very broad scope of strategies with impact on the course of normal aging as well as aging with competence losses. Also, it is assumed that this impact of intervention gerontology will grow even further in the future. In the following, current intervention gerontology research is discusses by particularly highlighting its connection with basic gerontology findings, the contextual view of aging, the interdisciplinary orientation, and the methodological standard. With respect to the potential of gero-intervention in the future, three prototypical domains are considered: (1) health and everyday competence, (2) living environments, and (3) communication.
