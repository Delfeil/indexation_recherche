From 1986 to 1994, we treated 79 patients with acute acromioclavicular separations by surgical reconstruction. According to the classification of Rockwood and Matsen, 65 patients had type III lesions, 1 patient had a type IV lesion and 13 patients had type V lesions. Both the coracoclavicular ligaments and the ligaments of the acromioclavicular joint were reconstructed. An additional ligamentous augmentation was performed using completely resorbable 5- and 10-mm polydioxanone-sulphate bands. Fifty-five patients (70%) were reexamined 1 - 7.5 years after surgery (mean 28 months). The results were good to excellent in 50 cases (90%). Fifty-two patients (93%) achieved a range of motion with an abduction deficit of less than 20 °. Calcifications in the area of the coracoclavicular ligaments did not affect the final range of motion. Early complications consisted of a subcutaneous infection, one deep infection, and one reconstruction failure. Late complications consisted of a redislocation in 2 patients and symptomatic post-traumatic arthritis of the joint in 3 cases. Augmenting the reconstruction with polydioxyanone-sulphate bands allowed early functional postoperative treatment. With this procedure, patients do not require removal of the implant, and complications from breakage or migration of metal implants are avoided.
