Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is used in the follow-up of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy or who have systemic disease. However, easy assessment and high diagnostic value of PSA should not lead to frequent and unnecessary testing. Following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy intervals of 6 months appear to be sufficient whereas patients with metastatic disease should be followed symptom related.
