 In surgical procedures associated with high blood loss, such as vascular and cardiac operations, differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance. Preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders [drug-induced platelet disorders (in particular ASS), von Willebrand's disease and other congenital platelet disorders] is effective in minimizing blood loss. Bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance. Therefore, simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems. The aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding.
