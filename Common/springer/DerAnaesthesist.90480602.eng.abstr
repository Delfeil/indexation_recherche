Objectives: Muscle relaxants have different pharmacodynamic profiles in various muscles. Therefore, results obtained for one muscle cannot be extrapolated to other muscles. In the adductor pollicis muscle cisatracurium exerts a pharmacodynamic profile comparable to atracurium, despite the known difference in onset time. However, studies evaluating the neuromuscular effect of cisatracurium in different muscles are lacking. Accordingly, this study compares the pharmacodynamic profile of cisatracurium and atracurium in the orbicularis oculi muscle (OO) - which shows a neuromuscular course similar to the diaphragm and the laryngeal muscles - and the adductor pollicis muscle (AP).
