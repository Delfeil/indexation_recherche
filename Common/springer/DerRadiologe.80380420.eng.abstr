Native Tissue Harmonic Imaging is a new way of ultrasound image processing that addresses the difficult-to-image patient. By using a Gaussian shaped transmit pulse it is possible to separate from the returning echo the harmonic component without overlapping with fundamental reflections. The improved image quality leads to higher diagnostic confidence so that the use of further imaging modalitites is unnecessary.
