The esthetic and functional restoration of facial defects is always a daunting challenge. The advent of free vascularized tissue transfers in combination with oral implants enables the surgeon to attain a high level of flexibility in the treatment of such defects. Due to its anatomical properties, the osteocutaneous scapula flap qualifies to a high degree for reconstruction purposes in the midfacial area. From July 1990 to February 1997, reconstruction of complex facial defects after oncologic surgery was performed in 17 patients using free vascularized tissue transfer. In four cases, a free scapula flap was used. Advantages and disadvantages of this technique are illustrated in these patients. Complete oral rehabilitation requires bony continuity of the jaws and stable dentition. To attain this goal, additional grafting procedures are required in most cases when insertion of oral implants is planned. As for the soft tissues, the problem of measuring the amount of tissue needed often leads to an overcorrection, requiring several debulking procedures.
