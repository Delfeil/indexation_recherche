Abstract.  It is rare for solitary basal cell cancer not to be associated with the naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), xeroderma pigmentosum, an organoid nevus or X-ray therapy in children (to date 86 cases have been documented in the literature). Aetiologically, the tumours might be a forme fruste of the NBCCS or they might follow a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes. Up to now, data on the repair mechanism following UV-induced DNA damage are not available in these patients. We report on a 10-year-old boy with a solitary nodular basal cell cancer in the right malar region. Neither the patient's history nor the clinical findings suggested a genetic disposition to development of the tumour.
