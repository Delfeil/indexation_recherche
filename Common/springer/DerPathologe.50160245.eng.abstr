In recent years there has been considerable progress in brain tumor neuropathology. Several new diagnostic entities have been recognized, subclassification schemes have been modified, and new concepts on the histogenesis and cell biology of brain tumors have emerged. In 1993, a revised WHO classification of brain tumors was published by an international committee. This article summarizes the pertinent new aspects. As novel tumor entities, the central neurocytoma, the dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT), desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma (DIG) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) have been included. Several histopathological variants of meningiomas have been added of which only the papillary meningioma and the atypical meningioma are characterized by an increased rate of recurrence. Meningeal hemangiopericytomas and hemangioblastomas are classified as tumors of non-meningothelial origin. The glioblastoma multiforme, which had previously been listed as an embryonal tumor, is now recognized as an astrocytic glioma. Immunohistochemistry has greatly advanced the practical diagnosis and classification of brain tumors. There are specific markers for all normal and neoplastic cell types except for oligodendroglioma cells. The prognosis of and therapeutic approaches to brain tumors greatly depend on histopathological grading. The WHO proposes four tumor grades, i. e., I, II, III, and IV. As a rule, grades I and II tumors are viewed as benign or semi-benign neoplasms and grades III and IV tumors as malignant. There are attempts to use new biological parameters for the grading of brain tumors. Antibodies to proliferation-associated proteins reflect tumor growth. Molecular genetic approaches to tumor-associated genes and gene loci are particularly promising new tools for the future.
