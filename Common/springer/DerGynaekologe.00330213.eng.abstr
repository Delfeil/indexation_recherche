Due to the expanding use of laparoscopic surgery in gynecology, the necessity for evaluation of results was raised. With the intention of quality control in gynecological endoscopy, the gynecological department of the Evangelisches Diakonie-Krankenhaus in Bremen has developed, in cooperation with the Institute for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bremen and on behalf of the German Society for Gynecological Endoscopy, the quality control program "German Gynecological Endoscopy Complication Register". In 1997, 20 German endoscopic centers took part in the prospective observational study. A total number of 17,745 cases were reported. Altogether 20,050 endoscopic procedures were performed, 8020 hysteroscopies and 12030 laparoscopies. The complication rate for hysteroscopies amounted to 7.0permil and that of laparoscopies to 9.6permil. The quality control program of the German Society for Gynecological Endoscopy is a unique tool, comparable to the "German Perinatology Study". It allows to compare individual hospital profiles, an option that is necessary to gain the best possible results in terms of quality in gynecological surgery in the long term.
