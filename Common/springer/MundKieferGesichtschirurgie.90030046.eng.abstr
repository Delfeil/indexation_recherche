Plasmocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow, typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia, proteinuria, anemia and hypercalcemia. In its progress, deposits of amyloids in  almost all organs can be observed. However, plasmacytomas which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare. This case report presents a 61-year-old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations. A biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light-chain type, which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with lambda light-chains stage II after Durie and Salmon. In the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro-enteric system. Macroglossia as a primary manifestation of plasmacytoma is rarely described in medical literature. However, reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known.
