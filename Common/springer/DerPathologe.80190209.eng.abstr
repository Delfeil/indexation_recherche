Diagnostic und therapeutic management of gastric lymphomas of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type (MALT-type lymphomas) is often based exclusively on the evaluation of biopsy material. To evaluate the diagnostic value of gastric biopsies in gastric MALT-type lymphomas, biopsies - on average six per patient - and subsequent surgical specimens of 64 patients were compared at the Institute of Pathology, Unversity of Würzburg. Tumor diagnosis and tumor gradind were assessed. Using biopsy specimens, primary gastric MALT-type lymphomas were correctly diagnosed by local pathologists in 69% of cases, but correctly graded as low-grade, high-grade or secondary high-grade lymphomas in only 41%. When immunohistochemistry and molecular biological techniques were applied in addition to conventional histology, diagnosis of gastric MALT-type lymphoma was achieved in biopsies in 95% of cases at the Institute of Pathology Würzburg, but correct grading in only 73%. In secondary high-grade MALT-type lymphomas, both components - the high-grade and the low-grade component - were identified in gastric biopsies in only 33% of cases. Diagnostic accuracy in gastric lymphomas based on biopsies is limited by biopsy artefacts, but improved by using immunohistochemistry and molecular biological techniques. Particularly in secondary high-grade MALT-type lymphomas the correct diagnosis is often missed when using biopsies, due to a low number of biopsy specimens.
