A 58-year-old man developed an extensive pilomatrical carcinoma in the left axilla. Clinically, a squamous cell carcinoma was suspected. Histological examination revealed the presence of proliferating basaloid cells with many atypical mitoses and mass necrosis infiltrating into the subcutaneous tissue. The tumor was removed by micrographic surgery with a 2 cm safety margin. Histological examination of 2 regional lymph nodes as well as further diagnostic procedures ruled out metastases. We review the clinical and histopathological differences between pilomatricoma and pilomatrical carcinoma, as well as the published cases of the malignant variant.
