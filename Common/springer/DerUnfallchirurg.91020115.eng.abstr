Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using autologous hamstring tendons are being performed more frequently and satisfactory results have been reported. Advantages such as low donor site morbidity and ease of harvest as well as disadvantages like low initial construct stiffness have been described. Recently, it has been demonstrated that graft fixation close to the original ACL insertion sites increases anterior knee stability and graft isometry. Hamstring tendon fixation techniques using interference screws offer this possibility. To reduce the risk of graft laceration, a round threaded titanium interference screw (RCI) was developed. To improve initial fixation strength, fixation techniques for hamstring tendons with separate or attached tibial bone plugs were introduced. However, data on fixation strength do not yet exist. With respect to the proposed advantages of biodegradable implants, like undistorted magnetic resonance imaging, uncompromised revision surgery and a decreased potential of graft laceration during screw insertion, we performed pullout tests of round threaded biodegradable and round threaded titanium interference screw fixation of semitendinosus (ST) grafts with and without distally attached tibial bone plugs. Data were compared with bone-tendon-bone (BTB) graft fixation using biodegradable and conventional titanium interference screws.
