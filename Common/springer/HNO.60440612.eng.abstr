The results of 13 single-stage reconstructions of large and complex defects in the head and neck by using eight free radial forearm flaps as well as five pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps were analyzed. No complete flap loss occurred in any case. The results with radial forearm flap reconstructions proved to be better functionally and aesthetically. Due to the time needed for the microvascular anastomoses, the length of the operations was sometimes prolonged. Pectoralis major flaps were found to be more difficult to handle and were used in those cases in which the application of free radial forearm flaps was expected to produce higher risks.
