Intracranial germ cell tumors are a rare finding. They can cause a variety of different clinical symptoms due to the location of the tumor. Additionaly they can secret -HCG so that boys develop precocious puberty. We present the case history of five patients with intracranial germ cell tumors. Two of these patients had germ cell tumors of the suprasellar region; both developed diabetes insipidus. One of the two presented hypothalamic-pituitary deficits as well, the other patient showed signs of precocious puberty. The tumor of two further patients originated in the pineal region, at the time of diagnosis causing symptoms due to high intracranial pressure. One of these two patients developed priapism due to extremely elevated testosteron levels induced by his -HCG secreting tumor. A fifth patient with a tumor of the basal ganglia developed hemiparesis.
