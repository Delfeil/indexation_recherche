 Kryopreserved specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips. The cystic duct was fixed, and the transverse placed clips were distracted in axial direction and the forces registered. The median values of the six investigated clips ranged between 4.1 N and 11.2 N with a highly significant difference (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA). In detail, both resorbable clips (polydioxanone, polyglyconate/polyglycol acetate) were superior to the four titanium clips (P < 0.005, Wilcoxon test). In addition to the advantage of complete biodegradibility, these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips.
