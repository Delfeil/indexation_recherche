Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature. Closed femoral fractures and blunt soft tissue trauma are the main causes of this injury. The multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur. Fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of extense swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient. Sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury. During the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated. Therefore an operative revision of the sciatic nerve was performed eighteen weeks after trauma. No direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome. The tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy. Conclusion: Early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain, paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient. Tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign. Frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients. We suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far outweighed by the morbidity that accompanies an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy.
