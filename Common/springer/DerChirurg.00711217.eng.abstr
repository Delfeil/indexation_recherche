Abstract.  Within the framework of interdisciplinary palliative treatment strategies for gastrointestinal neoplasms, surgical therapeutic options are of essential importance. They are dominated by the reconstruction of the gastrointestinal passage, ensuring drainage of secretion and the alleviation of pain. Conventional, minimal-invasive and endoscopic procedures are employed individually or in a combined way, integrating all conservative therapies. In many cases, an unnecessary laparotomy with its high morbidity, mortality and prolonged hospitalisation can thus be avoided. This paper describes and discusses current surgical and endoscopic techniques for the palliative treatment of patients suffering from advanced gastrointestinal malignant tumours.
