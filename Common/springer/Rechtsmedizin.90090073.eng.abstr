 Death may occur while a fleeing or resisting suspect is taken into custody by the police. We report about this type of acute death in two males. In both cases, a cocaine intoxication was taken as the cause of death despite an initial suspicion of a direct association between the death and police measures (e.g. neck compression or "headlock", chest compression). From the Institute's autopsy material we selected another 12 cases with monointoxication by cocaine as the cause of death of as a secondary finding for comparison. Of the 12 cases 5 were gunshot injuries and 4 were classified as suicide. The analysis suggested an increased willingness to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine. In both cases, cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were unaware of any acute life-threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the suspects to flee or resist arrest. Attention should be given to these types of cases during the training of police officers.
