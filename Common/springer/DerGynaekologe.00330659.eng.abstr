Vaginal and uterine bleeding is a common symptom in gynecology. The cause of the bleeding should be investigated so as to exclude carcinoma as its origin. First, the basic circulation parameters should be determined. Blood volume and oxygen substitution are essential. Depending on these findings, further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken. If the situation is stable, diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor. A general examination, including a vaginal and rectal examination, must be performed. Other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound (vaginal and transabdominal) and CT or MRI may be required. If available, an angiography should be performed.
