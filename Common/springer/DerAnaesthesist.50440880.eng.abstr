Neoplastic or traumatic lesions of the brain stem or the upper spinal cord frequently cause respiratory insufficiency necessitating permanent mechanical ventilation. If the integrity of the diaphragm and its nerves is not affected, adequate ventilation can be achieved by electric stimulation of the phrenic nerves [1, 3, 5, 6]. Diaphragm pacing systems mean the patients can be independent of ventilator treatment. This is a psychological advantage for the patient, giving him or her the option of living in less specialized medical care units and perhaps even at home [4, 9].
