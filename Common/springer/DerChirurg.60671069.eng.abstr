 A treatment protocol is demonstrated, consisting of an osteotomy, either proximal or distal, of the bone defect with subsequent segmental transport via an anteromedially (tibia) or laterally (femur) mounted AO external fixation over an unreamed interlocking nail (monorail system). Twenty patients were treated by this method with indications as follows: 13 had a segmental bone defect of the tibia, 3 of the femur. Three patients showed post-traumatic and postinfectious leg-length discrepancies and one was treated for hypertrophic non-union of the femur. Defect distance varied between 5 and 18.5 cm and average time for transport was 19,42 days/cm for the tibial shaft, 15,93 days/cm for the femur. Two patients developed deep infection, which required change of treatment, removing the monorail system and application of an Ilizarov apparatus. Despite complications using the monorail system, all patients healed and no amputations were required. The monorail system can be used as an alternative to the Ilizarov method under certain criteria of patient selection; these criteria are shown by an algorithm for segmental bone defects without infection, respecting the soft-tissue status with or without neurovascular compromise.
