Hemangiopericytomas are mesenchymal  tumors and account for about 1% of all CNS tumors. Aggressive growth, tendency to local recurrence and relatively frequent metastases are the clinical features of these tumors. Histological characteristics are marked cellularity, vascularity and a dense net of reticular fibers. This case presents a patient with a local recurrence of a right temporal, atypical meningioma that had been operated on and irradiated elsewhere. After embolization  large parts of the tumor were removed palliatively. Histological aspects of the resected tumor were consistent with a diagnosis of an atypical meningioma. Not until hepatic metastases from this tumor were found was the diagnosis re-examined and corrected to a malignant meningeal hemangopericytoma. Surgical resection of primary tumor with frequent controls and, if needed, postoperative radiation therapy is the treatment of choice. Furthermore metastasizing atypical  meningiomas should be examined critically to determine if a hemangiopericytoma is present.
