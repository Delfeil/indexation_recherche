In the present study the interpersonal problems of a community sample of n=766 elderly at the age of 61 to 92 years were investigated by means of the German version of the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-C; Horowitz et al. 1994). The item analysis revealed that the IIP-C is suitable for the elderly. Beyond the age of 60, we found no considerable age-specific or sex-specific effects. The elderly from East-Germany, however, described themselves with more social openess, feeling more close to other people, and with more social competence. With the results of this study, that are largely representative for the general German population over 60 years, we present references for studies on interpersonal problems in clinical subgroups of the elderly.
