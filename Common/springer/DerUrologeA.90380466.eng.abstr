Systemic immunotherapy, notably with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN), has yielded a response rate of 10 % to 30 % in metastic renal cell carcinoma. However, systemic immunotherapy is limited by severe side effects, and long-lasting response is rare. Tumor palliation and quality-of-life are important end points for evaluating the clinical benefits of immunotherapy. Experimental and clinical treatment models have proved that local IL-2 application is less toxic than systemic treatment and is therapeutically effective. Here we report long-term experience with inhalation IL-2 therapy in 188 patients who had progressive pulmonary metastatic renal cell carcinoma. High-dose inhalation of IL-2 was used with low-dose systemic IL-2 or IFN. Maximal toxicity over the total treatment time was mild, and the low incidence of WHO grade 3 toxicity (24 %) allowed social activities and peformance of social roles. Comedication for systemic side effects was required only in half of the patients. Inhaled IL-2 prevented progress of pulmonary metastases in 68 % of patients for a median period of 9.8 months. Median survival was 12.4 months compared with the expected 5.3 months and quality-of-life did not differ substantially from pretreatment status. Local treatment can be applied alone or in combination with systemic therapy and can increase therapeutic efficacy.
