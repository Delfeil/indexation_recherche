 Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare, life-threatening pharmacogenetic disease. The genetic incidence is estimated to be 1 : 10 000. In predisposed individuals, MH is triggered by volatile anaesthetics and/or depolarizing muscle relaxants by an abnormal increase of intracellular calcium concentration in skeletal muscle cells. The clinical presentation may vary from abortive MH to the fulminant MH crisis. Early diagnosis, the use of electrocardiography and capnography for anaesthetic monitoring, immediate cessation of trigger agents and dantrolene treatment are essential components of an effective MH therapy. In some MH families, a genetic alteration of the ryanodine receptor gene (a calcium channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum) on chromosome 19 has been identified as the potential cause of MH susceptibility. Recent molecular biological findings support the view of MH being a heterogenetic disease. At present, the diagnosis in potentially MH-susceptible individuals is still made using the in vitro halothane and caffeine muscle contracture test.
