Life-threatening cardiovascular complications are a serious risk even for healthy patients during spinal/epidural anaesthesia. The incidence of fatal cardiovascular complications for epidural anaesthesia is 1:10000, for spinal anaesthesia 1:7000. In contrast, general anaesthesia has an overall mortality of only 1:28000. Administration of IV fluids to minimise the haemodynaemic reactions of beginning sympatholysis is not always sufficient. In this study, we examined whether fractionated application of local anaesthetics via a spinal catheter would provide better haemodynamic stability.
