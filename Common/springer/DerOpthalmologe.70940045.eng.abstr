In dilation of nasolacrimal duct stenosis materials now being used originally were developed for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Suitable modifications of the angioplasty equipment could improve therapeutic results and thus influence the area of indication of this new technique. In addition to the standard PTCA equipment, we used a cannula designed to fit the guide wire, leading to less traumatic intubation of the lacrimal duct and allowing radiographic control of the recanalization procedure. Five patients showing relative stenosis and ten patients showing complete obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct were treated by dacryocystoplasty. Clinical and radiographic follow-up was done over a period of 6 months. In a total of seven patients, dilation proved successful. Out of these, four showed stenosis (80% recanalization rate) and three complete obstruction (30% recanalization rate) before dilation. Recanalization by dilation using balloon catheters seems to be possible even in cases of complete nasolacrimal duct obstruction. However, the success rate is considerably lower than in relative stenosis.
