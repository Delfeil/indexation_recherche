The clinical and experimental data relevant to the theoretical mechanisms and clinical results of laser myocardial "revascularization" are reviewed. Both transmyocardial (TMR) and percutaneous (PMR) approaches are considered. Special attention is paid to the issue of TMR-induced angiogenesis. Both TMR and PMR result in a reduction in angina symptoms in patients refractory to conventional therapy and are likely to act through common pathways. TMR-induced angiogenesis appears to result from the up-regulation of vascular growth factors. However, the available data suggest that the angiogenic response is not a unique consequence of laser revascularization. Rather, the angiogenesis associated with TMR is likely to be a non-specific response of the myocardium to injury.
