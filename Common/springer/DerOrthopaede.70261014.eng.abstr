Complex joint trauma is a term reserved for specific and severe injuries that include two or more structural elements of the joint. These structural elements are the articulating bones, the major ligaments of the joint, the local soft tissue envelope and the neurovascular structures. Complex joint trauma has a high risk for complications and requires a special treatment algorhythm. A staged surgical protocol with initial soft tissue debridement, closed joint reduction and external fixation of the extremity followed by secondary recontructive surgery after soft tissue recovery is suggested.
