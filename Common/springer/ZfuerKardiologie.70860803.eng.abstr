 Dilated cardiomyopathy ist a desease of the myocardium which is characterized by predominant enlargement of the left ventricle, decreased systolic function, and reduced myocardial wall thickness. The reduction in the number and function of myocardial fibers induces hypertrophy and leads to intersitial fibrosis. Ventricular dilatation and reduced wall thickness contributes to a further increase of the already elevated myocardial wall stress and triggers the continuous decrease of mykocardial function.
