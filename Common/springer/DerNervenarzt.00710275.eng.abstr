In 45 patients with Parkinson's disease, we investigated coping behavior and its correlations to demographic and disease-related data, locus of control, depression, and psychosocial adaptation. Active, problem oriented, and self-reorganizing strategies were predominantly used and regarded as especially helpful by the 27 men and 18 women (age: 56 years; duration of illness: 9 years). While age and sex were not associated with coping, external locus of control correlated positively to "depressive coping" and duration of illness correlated negatively to "distraction and self-affirmation." Coping strategies regarded as maladaptive and a small degree of internal locus of control correlated to unfavourable results for depression and satisfaction.
