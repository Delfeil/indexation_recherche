 Behçet's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by the triad of oral and genital ulcers and ocular lesions. One of the most life-threatening manifestations results from involvement of the central nervous system, presenting as necrotising meningo-encephalitis, most typically affecting the brain stem, internal capsula and basal brain ganglia. We report on a young Caucasian mate with Behçet's disease (HLA B51+) and recurrent uveitis, who presented with acute neurologic involvement under CyA therapy 5 years after first diagnosis. At the time of admission MRI showed two high intensity lesions in the brain stem on T1 weighted images enhanced with Gd-DTPA, reflecting active inflammation.
