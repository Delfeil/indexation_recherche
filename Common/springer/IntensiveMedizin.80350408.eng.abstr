 Background: Evacuation of hemodynamically compromising pericardial effusion should be performed using intensive care facilities. If hemorrhagic fluid is aspired, it is difficult to distinguish cardiac or vascular damage from hemorrhagic effusion. Several methods of proving the correct position of the needle have been recommended, e.g., injection of radiopaque contrast medium or determination of the hemoglobin level. Methods: In 10 patients with hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, most of them having malignancies, pericardiocentesis was performed under echocardiographic guidance from a subxiphoid approach with the patient's chest tilted up app. 30 °. When hemorrhagic fluid was aspirated, 3 to 5 ml of d-galactose (Echovist-200, Schering AG, Berlin) was injected. The distribution in the pericardial effusion was followed echocardiographically. If the needle position was correct, a sheath and a pigtail catheter F5 were inserted over a guide wire. Results: A mean of 546 (260-800) ml of effusion was removed. In one patient, the contrast medium was visualized within the right ventricle indicating an incorrect needle position. This could be corrected without sequelae. In one patient, loculated effusion required a second pericardiocentesis. Conclusions: Contrast echocardiographically guided pericardiocentesis using Echovist as a contrast medium is a fast and safe method of evacuating hemorrhagic pericardial effusions, which can be performed in a bedside fashion.
