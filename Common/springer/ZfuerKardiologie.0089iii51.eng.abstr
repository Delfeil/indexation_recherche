 For the analysis of a disturbed autonomic function as a risk predictor for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, tonic and phasic procedures are available. The heart rate variability as a tonic procedure shows significant differences between patients with an increased risk of malignant arrhythmias and patients without increased risk. This can be demonstrated in patients with survived myocardial infarction, dilative cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. But the positive predictive value amounts only to about 50%.
