In our study we tested 2 different rapid assays for cardiac troponin t (TropT-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,2 ng/ml and TropTsensitive-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,1 ng/ml) in 75 chest pain patients. Additional to the emergency ECG (3-lead) we acquired a 12-lead ECG. The TropT-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 11% (specifity 94,3%). The TropT sensitive-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 62% (specifity 100%).
