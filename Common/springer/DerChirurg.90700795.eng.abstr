 Persistent sciatic artery as a rare entity results from lack of regression of the femoral artery blood supply of the leg and is often combined with an abnormally developed superficial femoral artery. We describe the case of a complete, persistent sciatic artery with peripheral ischemia caused by thrombo-embolism from buttock aneurysmal formation. Combined therapy of catheter fibrinolysis, followed by proximal and distal ligation of sciatic artery and peripheral bypass procedure, restored regular leg perfusion.
