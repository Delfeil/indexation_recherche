 Several studies have demonstrated an association Chlamydia pneumoniae with coronary artery disease, suggesting that infection with C. pneumoniae increases the risk for coronary artery disease by factor 2 or more. Since atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory process, these data would fit into the response-to-injury hypothesis of atherosclerosis rather than representing a completely novel concept. Several pathomechanisms as increased cytokine synthesis, proliferative and proaggregatory effects could transmit the effects of chronic C. pneumoniae infection. Animal models and first clinical trials using antibiotic therapy seem to support an etiological role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease. In this paper the current knowledge of the role of C- pneumoniae in coronary artery disease is reviewed and possible pathomechanisms are discussed.
