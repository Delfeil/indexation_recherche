 A case of unilateral pulmonary edema occurred after treatment of acute smoke inhalation injury complicated by respiratory failure. An endotracheal tube had been placed into the right main stem bronchus due to emergency treatment at the site of a large fire in a nursing home. Local dexamethasone prophylaxis had been administered by aerosol application via the tube before it was corrected 1 h later in the intensive care unit. We conclude that early local administration of aerosolized dexamethasone is an effective prophylaxis after severe acute smoke inhalation injury in patients undergoing ventilatory support and that the contralateral development of toxic pulmonary edema was most probably due to the inappropriate drug access.
