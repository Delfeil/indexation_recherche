 Lung transplantation (uni- or bilateral) is an accepted treatment option for patients with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pulmonary function improves significantly and 5-year-actuarial survival is more than 70 % at acceptable early mortality rates. Careful evaluation of risks and benefits is necessary because of the known donor-organ shortage and the risks of life-long immunosuppressive treatment. The bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is still a non-solved problem in the long-term course after LTx and it can influence late graft function and patient survival.
