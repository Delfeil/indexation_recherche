The usual treatment for operative repair of diaphragmatic injuries is laparotomy or thoracotomy. We report on a 26-year-old patient, who was treated by laparocopic surgery for a rupture on both sides of the diaphragm. The operation was without complications and the advantages of minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery were clearly evident. There was much less strain on the patient and the postoperative recovery period was short. In addition, for unclear findings there is a high diagnostic potential in laparoscopy. The rupture on the right side of the diaphragm was not diagnosed until laparoscopy, although our patient underwent extensive diagnostics prior to the intervention.
