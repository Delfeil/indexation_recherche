 Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is a rare indication for liver transplantation. The excised liver of the FAP patient can be transplanted into a selected patient. In the following report, sequential liver transplantation is described where a 34-year-old female FAP patient received a cadaver donor liver. The excised native liver was transplanted to a 60-year-old male patient suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis due to hepatitis C.
