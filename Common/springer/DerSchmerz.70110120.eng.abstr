The present paper is one in a series of publications reviewing German instruments for the psychological assessment of pain. Part X deals with pain measurement of acute and chronic pain in infants and children. German assessment instruments of pediatric pain together with frequently used instruments of American origin are examined and described. The survey contains self-report and behavioral pain measures. Multidimensional pain interviews for both children and parents, diaries and rating scales, as well as observation measures especially for infants, are examined. Since the selection of pain-assessment instruments is dependent on the age and cognitive level of the children, for each instrument a minimum age limit is given. In cases in which quantitative indices of reliability, validity and objectivity are still needed, the evaluation is based on qualitative quotations.
