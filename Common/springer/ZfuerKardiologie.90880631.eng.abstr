 Aims: The flow convergence method enables the determination of flow across restrictive orifices. It was validated for planar orifice plates and atrioventricular valves. However, its quantitative application to aortic regurgitation is complicated due to the complex valve anatomy which distorts the converging flow field. An open angle formed by the leaflets causes relatively lower velocities in the region near the orifice, resulting in underestimation of flow. Confinement of the flow convergence region by the ascending aorta relatively increases the velocities at greater distance to the orifice and can cause overestimation of flow. We hypothesized that there is a region at intermediate distance to the orifice, where both these effects on the flow field are minimal, so that the local velocity there is only a function of flow. Methods and results: In a flow model, aortic regurgitation was simulated. The flow convergence was imaged by color Doppler. Different scanning directions were used (analogue to apical and parasternal approach). Velocity profiles across the flow convergence were read along the line from the scanhead to the orifice. At a distance of 7 mm to the orifice, a uniform value was found for the ratio of local velocity v(7 mm)/flow (=0.28cm-2). Variations in size (3.5 to 7 mm), site (central versus lateral) and leaflet angle (planar versus inverted funnel) of the orifice and in the scanning approach had only a minimal effect on this value. Conclusion: The aortic regurgitant flow convergence is characterized by a relatively uniform V (7 mm)/Q. Independent of variations in the anatomy and the scanning approach, this value directly reflects flow.
