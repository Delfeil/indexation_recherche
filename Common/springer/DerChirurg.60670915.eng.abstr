 In 348 patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between 1985 and 1994 we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection, its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging. The same histopathological work-up was carried out in all cases. Whether resections or extirpations were performed, the number of dissected lymph nodes increased from 5.3 and (1985/1986) to 16.7 and 17.3 (1991/1992) and to 15.8 and 17.3 (1993/1994) respectively. Neither the type of operation nor the surgeon's experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected. The increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation, the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk. We found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases (P = 0.02) and between an increase in UICC stage III (P = 0.005) and pN2 tumors (P = 0.000) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected. Central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases.
