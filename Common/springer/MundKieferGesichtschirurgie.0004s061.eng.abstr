In spite of all interdisciplinary efforts and functionally oriented operation procedures, there are still unsatisfying results in the treatment of cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients. Secondary corrections involve upper lip, nose, and palate (fissures). In some cases, it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla. Finally, there are indications for speech improving measures and total septorhinoplasties. Dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant-borne prosthodontic work. In this paper, some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described, which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary CLP care.
