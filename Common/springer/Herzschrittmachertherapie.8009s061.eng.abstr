 Meta-analysis is often used as a synonym for result synthesis of single studies. This disregards the important fact that meta-analysis is only the last statistical step in a systematic review. The latter is a scientific method which extracts the best actually available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Systematic reviews use explicit rules for the inclusion of studies. These refer to criteria of study quality such as patient selection, conduct or methods of analyses. Meta-analyses of pooled individual study data facilitate a cautious analysis of patient subgroups impossible with single study results. They may produce new evidence and generate new hypotheses. Meta-analyses which are merely restricted to information obtained from the literature require critical scrutiny. Summarizing non-randomized observational studies with meta-analytical techniques should be avoided in most situations.
