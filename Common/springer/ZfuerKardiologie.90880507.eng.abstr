  The aim of this serial 3 year follow-up study in 42 clinically stable patients with chronic aortic dissection was to assess quantitatively morphologic changes of the descending thoracic aorta (AD) using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Communicating dissections (ca) were present in 16/19 patients with operated type I and in 11/23 patients with type III AD wherase 12/23 type III AD according to De Bakey were non-communicating (nc). Diametral enlargement of the desc. thoracic aorta was 4 mm (mean value) at 1 year in all patients, 5.9 mm in type I ca, 7.2 mm in type III ca but only 3.1 mm in type III nc at 3 years. The ration between true lumen and false lumen (FL) changed in ca AD from 1:2 to 1:3 over the period of 3 years but remained constant at 1:1 in ncAD. Progressive thrombosis of the false lumen (FL) occurred in 76 % of patients but complete thrombosis of the FL occurred in only 6 % of type I ca, 18 % type III ca but in 84 % of type III nc patients.
