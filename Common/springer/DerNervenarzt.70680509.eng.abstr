Abstract  Quantitative assessment of thermal and pain sensitivity (Marstock method on a SOMEDIC Thermotest, Somedic AB Stockholm, Schweden) was made and the function of autonomic nerveous system (sympathetic skin response and R-R interval variation) indicating the function of small nerve fibres (A-delta and C) was determined in 44 patients with symptoms of the presumed sensory neuropathy. The function of the large nerve fibres was evaluated by the classic nerve conduction study. The methods of small nerve fibres evaluation exhibited greater sensitivity as the classic nerve conduction study. The dysfunction of small nerve fibre function was morphologically proved by sural nerve biopsy.
