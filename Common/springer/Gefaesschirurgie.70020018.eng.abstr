 Vascular injury by irradiation seldom occurs. Particularly at risk are the iliac and femoral arteries after radiation therapy of lower abdominal tumors. The problem of vascular reconstruction is explained in a case report about a 78-year-old female patient, who received an extra-anatomic iliofemoral crossover bypass after radiation-induced occlusion of her left iliac artery. Because of an infection with a deep ulcer in the left femoral region, the extra-anatomic iliofemoral bypass was removed and vascular reconstruction was performed by a lateral aortofemoral reconstruction. The ulcer was treated by a fasciocutaneous flap.
