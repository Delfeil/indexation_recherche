Abstract.  An increasing number of surgical departments is creating its own homepage in the World Wide Web (WWW). We investigated 184 presentations concerning their quality in content and technical realization. Our research revealed that most presentations regard patients as their main target group in order to meet the patients' demand for information and transparency. However, universities are especially concentrating on scientific development and neglecting the patients. Only a few presentations contain means for web-based training. In general, technical realization seems to be much better than the content itself. As patients tend to appear as customers who will choose the hospital they feel comfortable with, every clinical department that is a competitor should create a communication and information base for their customers. Thus, they will be able to keep in touch, present their treatment types and to enable patients to compare a multitude of surgical departments. The usefulness for colleagues or cooperating institutions must be improved. The WWW has become an important center of information in surgery.
