The serin protease tryptase (ECNr. 3.4.21.59), which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells, is released by mast cell degranulation in an enzymatically active form together with other mediators, e.g. histamine, into the extracellular space and the circulation. The capability of the enzyme to directly stimulate several cell types as well as to cleave polypeptide hormones and to activate pro-enzymes suggests a role for tryptase in inflammatory and tissue-remodeling processes. Therefore, in the skin, a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions, but also in other inflammatory diseases, degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing, where an accumulation and/or activation of mast cells is found. Extracellular tryptase may be superior to histamine as a parameter for the onset and course of immediate type reactions and as an indicator for the activation of mast cells in other conditions. Its absence during histamine-liberating reactions may suggest basophil activation. In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues.
