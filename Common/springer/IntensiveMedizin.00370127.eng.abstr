 We report on a 55-year old patient who presented with a four month history of intermittent left thoracic painful attacks which radiated in the left arm. Both normal 12 lead electrocardiogram and treadmill stress tests showed no significant ST changes. A thallium-201 scintigraphy afterwards disclosed a non-transmural septal ischemia. The consecutively performed diagnostic catheterization revealed a severe, almost pouch-like proximal aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a maximal diameter of 15-20 mm as well as an aneurysmatic modified left coronary artery and an impaired left ventricular function (EF 49%). In the absence of coronary artery stenosis, the patient was treated conservatively with an ACE inhibitor (lisinoprile 20 mg/day) under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with coumadin. With this strategy the patient has been asymptomtic during the eight month follow-up period.
