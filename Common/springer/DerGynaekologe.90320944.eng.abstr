An overall view shows that the organization of a department of gynaecology and obstetrics is a highly complex task. Not only formal, legal positions have a role in this; personal strengths, such as the ability to convince others by professional and personal authority and by exerting the will to manage, are also essential. Management requires the superintendent to define his or her own range of duties in collaboration with a representative or representatives of the authority responsible for the hospital. It has proved worthwhile for the responsible authority and the medical superintendent to lay down guidelines for procedures and instructions to be adopted in standard situations (indications, informing assistant medical director, paediatrics and neonatology, examination to be carried out on admission, division of labour with midwives, etc.) in writing, to inform the staff of these together, and to deposit the guidelines at a central point in the department, so that any member of staff can consult them without any substantial hold-up if there are any points of dispute or uncertainties.
