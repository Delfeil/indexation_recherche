Fetal teratomas are extra- or intracorporal congenital malformations with different localization. Although they are rare, they may provoke severe obstetrical complications if they are not prenatally diagnosed. If sonographic examination of fetal teratomas is performed, it is necessary to evaluate the further development of pregnancy for fetal outcome and pregnancy aspects in relationship to the localization, size and ultrasound criteria of the tumor. Sonographic findings reveal the criteria and conditions for conservative or invasive management or reasons for continuing or terminating the pregnancy. Prenatal ultrasound examination is the only possibility to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, as exemplified by 8 prenatally examined fetal teratomas.
