The incidence of melanoma, the most aggressive tumor of the skin, is increasing worldwide. The genetic mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of melanoma are poorly understood. Mutations of p16 (CDKN2), p53, ras, neurofibromatosis type I gene (NF-1), bcl 2 and the retinoblastoma gene have been described, but none are common. Suggesting heterogeneous mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Both familial inheritance of potential tumor suppressor genes, e.g. p16, and differences in DNA-repair capacity contribute to the individual risk for melanoma. The most important carcinogen for melanoma seems to be UV exposition whose mutagenic effects can be demonstrated by molecular analysis of detected point mutations in relevant genes. The UV-induced DNA damage generates mutations which are capable of activating proto-oncogenes or inactivating tumor suppressor genes, demonstrating the molecular link between UV exposition, DNA damage, mutations and tumor initiation and/or progression. A stage-dependent model of melanoma carcinogenesis analogous to colorectal cancer remains to be established, despite the existence of morphologically and histopathologically well defined melanoma precursor lesions in the skin.
