 "The Old Kulm Law" was a medieval town code, one of the most important inspired by the Kulm Charter and widespread in the Teutonic Order state from the end of fourteenth century. It was influenced by the Magdeburg town code and contained many similar resolutions also in the matter of the qualification of body lesions. The medico-legal questions in "The Old Kulm Law" were not only limited to this subject and some of ideas presented gave rise to an appreciation after centuries. The three revisions of the Kulm law performed in Royal Prussia (the part of the realm of polish kings) in the sixteenth century transformed it to the most excellent in the Kingdom of Poland.
