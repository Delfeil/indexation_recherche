By the method of the colour-coded duplex Dopplersonography the maximal velocity of flow and the diameter of the vertebral artery are measured on the level of the atlantal loop. 3 different head positions were examined, namely positioning at 0  °, 45  ° and rotation and 90  ° rotation of the head. The measurements are taken on the contralateral side of the rotation. The study concept was drafted, to measure in the above described positions. For the first time it was possible to measure the vertebral artery during the whole phase of an increasing traction of the head till 10 kg. No significant change for the velocity of flow and the diameter of the vertebral artery was detected regardless wether the head position or the traction of the head.
