Six patients (3 children and 3 adults) with acute exacerbated atopic eczema were treated with basic emollients in combination with chlorhexidine-soaked dressings over a period of three days using the "wet-pyjama" technique. Improvement of eczema was documented with the severity score "Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis" (SCORAD); most pronounced changes were found for the subjective parameters itch and sleep loss. Paralleling skin improvement a reduction of Staphylococcus aureus colonisation was noted. Improvement of skin changes lasted beyond the active treatment period. Wet-wrap dressings are an effective treatment modality for atopic eczema without use of corticosteroids and can be used easily on an outpatient basis when manufactured dressings are used.
