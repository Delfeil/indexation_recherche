  Within the last 5 years new less invasive surgical techniques have been developed in the field of cardiac surgery. This new field named minimally invasive cardiac surgery can be subdivided into techniques which do not require cardiopulmonary bypass and are used mainly for coronary artery surgery (called minimally invasive direct coronary artery surgery, MIDCAB technique). This MIDCAB procedure can be done through a small left anterior thoracotomy or a sternotomy. In addition there are other methods which allow the performance of complex cardiac surgery through small accesses in combination with the use of an endovascular CPB system and internal aortic clamping to achieve cardioplegic arrest (so-called Port-Access method). Also for valvular surgery, new surgical techniques were developed allowing access to mitral and aortic valves through limited incisions. In addition, new less invasive techniques were developed for congenital heart surgery. This article will describe the various surgical techniques and define the indications for minimally invasive cardiac surgery.
