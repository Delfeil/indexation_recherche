In clinical practice, the administration of supplementary albumin often depends on the measured plasma concentration of total protein (TPC). A TPC of less than 5 g/dl is generally accepted as an indication for albumin therapy, assuming an albumin concentration of less than 2.5 g/dl. However, a physiological relation between TPC and albumin cannot be expected in critically ill patients, and thus, measurement of TPC may be misleading as an indicator for the use of albumin. Therefore, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of TPC testing for diagnosing hypoalbuminaemia requiring treatment.
