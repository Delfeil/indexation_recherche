PUVA-induced acrobullous dermatosis is characterized by the occurrence of blisters on the acral extremities during PUVA therapy. The tense blisters apparently arise as a result of PUVA damage to the epidermodermal cohesion coupled with friction or trauma. They must be distinguished from phototoxic reactions induced either by UVA overdosage or excessive psoralen uptake. We report on, two cases of acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis, discussing clinical features, pathophysiological aspects and differential diagnosis.
