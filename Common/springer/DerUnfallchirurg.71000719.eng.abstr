In the presented study, knee joint proprioception of 43 patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated. In a control group, the proprioception of 30 healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestic inconspicous knee joints was examined. We tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test. Additionally, all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage. The patient group showed significant deterioration of angle reproduction capability (13.2  °  +/-  6.1  °) compared to the control group (7.8  °  +/-  2.8  °). After applying an elastic knee bandage, the angle reproduction capability significantly improved to 9.2  °  +/-  4.5  °. Proprioception of the contralateral, noninvolved knee joint in the patients (11.6  °  +/-  6.3  °) was worse compared to the control group. Applying an elastic knee bandage did not significantly improve the proprioception of the uninjured knee joint.
