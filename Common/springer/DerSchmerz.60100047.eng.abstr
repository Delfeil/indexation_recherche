 Four multidimensional inventories used as instruments for the assessment of pain are examined: "Fragebogen zur Erfassung der Schmerzverarbeitung' [Questionnaire for Assessment of Level of Coping with Pain], "Kieler Schmerzverarbeitungs-Inventar' [Kiel Inventory of Coping with Pain], "Fragebogen zur Schmerzregulation' [Questionnaire on Pain Regulation], and the German version of the "Multidimensional Pain Inventory'. None of these questionnaires assesses all domains that are important in chronic pain. The recommended standardized assessment routine for pain centres includes the use of a diary, the rating of actual, average and maximum pain intensity, the application of the PDI, a measure of disability, and the FESV, which records cognitive processing and coping. As measures of general psychological dysfunction the ADS for the assessment of depression and the B-L, a symptom checklist, are suggested as instruments suitable for routine use in diagnosis and evaluation.
