The doctor in charge, who is generally the medical director, is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational faults within his or her department. Even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible - that is to say the medical director - to be liable. For this reason, the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training. Every training measure must guarantee specialist standards; this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist. A legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times. Operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist; otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization. Because of staff shortages it often happens that inexperienced beginners - often doctors doing their practical training - are on call very early on. In the high-risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times. The changeover from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are rested and that adequate free time is guaranteed. There must be no friction when cooperation with other disciplines concerned is needed. Each sector must know its own area of responsibility. The doctor in charge is resonsible for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment. Uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his/her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects.
