Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole) have revolutionized the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention. These substances inhibit the H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of H2-receptor-antagonists. The first proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has been introduced ten years ago. Since then, sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated. Omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older. A new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients. The main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies. In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics. The recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0,7-1,4 mg/kg bodyweight and day. However, some children with ulcerative esophagitis may need daily doses up to 3.5 mg/kg. Healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy. After remission, doses can often be reduced for maintenance therapy. Side effects are rare and do not seem to increase with higher doses. Possibly interactions with other medications, i.e. antiepileptic drugs, may occur. A long-term therapy lasting more than 6 months in a child should be monitored by an experienced pediatric gastroenterologist.
