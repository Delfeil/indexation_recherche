 Despite all efforts to find alternative bypass material, there is still a need for arterial grafts for autologous saphenous vein grafts in coronary or peripheral bypass surgery. Harvesting of the saphenous vein is usually performed with a continuous or with interrupted skin incisions. Severe wound complications occur in 1-3% while minor complications occur frequently in up to 43%. We developed an endoscopic harvesting technique using a single 2-3 cm skin incision. Endoscopic vein harvesting was performed in 218 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Severe wound complications did not occur. One hematoma and three seroma were noted. According to our experience, we employ the endoscopic harvesting as a routine procedure especially in patients with a higher risk of wound complications.
