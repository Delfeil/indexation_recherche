 Today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques. The retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach. The correct anatomical placement of the first trocar is of particular importance in procedures with the patient in lateral decubitus position in order to avoid injuries. The overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the magnifying effect of the laparoscope, which is, furthermore, positioned very close to the operative field. It is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation. The decisive anatomical aspects and landmarks in different minimally invasive operations on retroperitoneal organs are outlined.
