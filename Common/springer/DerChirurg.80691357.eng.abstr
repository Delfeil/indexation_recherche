 Benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to "malignant" complications, so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance. Our investigation summarizes a 10-year experience after surgical treatment of 29 patients suffering from benign intracavitary cardiac tumors. The postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in 27 cases; in 2 cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed. The main symptom in 19 patients was dyspnea. In 8 cases an embolic event occurred. All patients underwent extirpation of the tumor. Early mortality was 10 %, while late mortality was 4 %. The treatment of choice of benign intracavitary cardiac tumors is extirpation, which, due to unpredictable embolic complications, is to be carried out immediately should the tumor have a lobulated tuberous surface. In such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance.
