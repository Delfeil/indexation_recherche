 Background: Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (EXCH) is an important regulator of intracellular calcium homeostasis. To maintain a normal intracellular Ca2+ concentration, EXCH expression may be upregulated before the onset of end-stage heart failure. We tested for a correlation between the EXCH transcription level and the degree of myocardial dysfunction as well as the suitability of EXCH transcription as a molecular marker for early detection of a transition from adequate to inadequate myocardial adaptation to chronic pressure and/or volume overload in valvular heart disease (VHD).   Methods: The level of EXCH transcription was analyzed in myocardial biopsies from eleven patients with aortic stenosis (AS), five with aortic regurgitation (AR) and six with primary mitral regurgitation (MR) of different hemodynamic severity and myocardial impairment using the quantitative rt-PCR technique. In addition, endomyocardial tissue from thirteen explanted hearts with end-stage heart failure and biopsies from seven individuals without heart disease were investigated.   Results: The mean level of EXCH transcription in patients with AS was: 1.8 +/- 1.4amol/ng total RNA, with AR: 1.9 +/- 0.8amol/ng and with MR: 2.2 +/- +2.1 amol/ng. This was not from different controls (2.6 +/- 1.2 amol/ng total RNA). However, in myocardium from end-stage heart failure, EXCH transcription was increased fourfold amounting to 8.9 +/- 1.9amol/ng total RNA. No difference in the EXCH transcription was found in VHD with respect to the degree of myocardial dysfunction: cardiac index (CI) >3.5l/min/m2 (EXCH 1.4 +/- 1.1amol/ng total RNA); CI 3.5-2.4 (EXCH 2.5 +/- 1.8); CI <2.4 (EXCH 1.8 +/- 1.0); EF-angio >50% (EXCH 1.9 +/- 1.8); EF-angio <=50% (EXCH 1.9 +/- 0.9); EF-RNV >50% (EXCH 2.4 +/- 1.8), EF-RNV <=50% (EXCH 1.7 +/- 1.0).   Conclusion: Myocardial EXCH transcription does not change parallel to the degree of myocardial dysfunction in VHD. Consequently, myocardial EXCH transcription does not appear to be suitable as a parameter indicating the transition from adequate to inadequate myocardial adaptation to chronic volume and/or pressure overload.
