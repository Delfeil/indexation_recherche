Erythropoietin, the hematopoietic growth factor, is synthesised in the kidneys and liver and regulates red blood cell production. Within the last few years, recombinant DNA technology has produced synthetic erythropoietin (rhEPO). Some patients, especially Jehova's Witnesses, will not accept blood transfusion. The perioperative administration of rhEPO increases the patients' hematocrit (HCt) to a higher than physiological level.
