 In the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period. However, about 20% of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive, the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles. Furthermore, beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are, e.g., left heart failure, inadequate sedation, neuropsychiatric issues, malnutrition and aspiration.   The mere application of a consistent weaning strategy (independent from its concrete content) leads to an improved success rate. In this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with: 1) The concept of interventions (in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes unloading respiratory muscles), 2) pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3) organisation of the T-tube trials.   A new approach in weaning of long-term ventilated patients is non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NMV). Compared to invasive mechanical ventilation NMV aims at reducing weaning time, decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis. Finally, the last section addresses terminal weaning.
