In Germany, as in all industrial nations, there has been an increase in the number of cases of cancer and in cancer-related mortality. According to the German Federal Bureau of Statistics, in 1998 nearly 213,000 persons died due to malignant cancer. Cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all. Pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family. Although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy, in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians. This work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine.
