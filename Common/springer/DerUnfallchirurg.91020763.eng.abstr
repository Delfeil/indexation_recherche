The discussion about the therapy of the posterior cruciate ligament persists. Conservative treatment, augmented repair, and reconstruction with autografts are discussed. From 1993 to 1997, 49 patients with posterior cruciate ligament rupture had repair Trevira ligament augmentation of 3 mm. There were 21 isolated and 28 combined ruptures. In 5 cases bony avulsions were refixed by screw or additional hook plate. Investigation of 36 patients, in 15 cases with isolated ligamentous ruptures was made. Osseous avulsion had good results in all cases. Isolated posterior cruciate ligament rupture showed good stability in 7 of 15 cases and instability of 2 + in 8 cases. The medial range Lysholm score was 76.8 (+/- 21.6), the OAK score showed 2 very good and 5 good results, 3 fair and 5 bad results. Using the IKDC score led to 3 very good and 4 good results, 2 fair and 6 bad results. Using subjective criteria, 10 patients described results as very good or good, 2 fair and 3 bad. Posterior cruciate ligament rupture with additional knee injury or fracture of the leg showed bad results in 60 % of cases, and good or fair results in only 40 %. We think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft.
