 We report on a 26 year old woman with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, diagnosed at 10 years of age, who developed arthritis, symptoms of celiac disease, and Sjögren's syndrome 15 years later. Clinical symptoms, biopsies of duodenal mucosa and salivary glands as well as serological findings established the diagnoses. A coincidence of these pathologies has not been reported before. Gluten-free diet alleviated severity of clinical symptoms very quickly indicating the basic pathology of celiac enteropathy in the immunological disorders.
