Complications during cataract surgery such as dropped nucleus or lens fragment dislocation into the vitreous cavity may become sight threatening. The recommendations regarding possible therapeutic approaches are inconsistent. Several factors like uveitis and/or an increased intraocular pressure play a major role in the decision on the further surgical procedure. Recent publications recommend an early pars plana approach in order to avoid any traction at the peripheral retina during manipulations via a limbal approach.
