In recent years the investigation of cytokines has been a focus of scientific interest in order to understand the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. In additions cytokines are increasingly being used for therapeutic purposes, including dermatologic disorders. IL-10 is a recently described cytokine with anti- inflammatory and immunosuppressive qualities which plays an important role in immunoregulation. The overexpression of this mediator has been proven in some inflammatory dermatoses as well as in various skin tumors. These observations help to understand down regulatory events in hyperinflammatory conditions such as allergic or toxic dermatitis on the one hand and the suppression of an adequate anti-tumor response and thereby the progression of malignant tumors on the other hand. Recent investigations indicate a relative IL-10 deficiency in psoriasis. Initial therapeutic applications of IL-10 in psoriasis underline the pathophysiological importance of this cytokine.
