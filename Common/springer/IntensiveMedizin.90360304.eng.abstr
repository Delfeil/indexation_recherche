 A 57 year old female patient was admitted with acute myocardial infarction of the posterior wall. In the angiography of the coronary arteries, a dissection of the right coronary artery was found. The vessel was successfully recanalized by implantation of two stents. Further diagnostics showed a dissected aneurysm of the aorta ascendens (Stanford type A) and a bicuspid aortic valve.
