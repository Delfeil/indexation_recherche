E-mail is an Internet service that can be used for sending messages and binary files between individuals as well as for participating in discussion groups. For sending and receiving these types of messages, the users must use either a dedicated e-mail client or one of the several mailing facilities of the World Wide Web. The newsgroups enable like-minded people to discuss subjects on a group-wide basis, but access is generally not limited, and the participants cannot be selected.
