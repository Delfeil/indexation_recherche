We report a case of a 41-years-old woman presenting for revision of a secondary reconstructive procedure using the modified Tagliacozzi upper arm flap after subtotal maxillectomy. Because of the pedicle flap the upper arm was fixed in a pre-facial position and so fiberoptic intubation was required. After routine pre-anesthetic preparations and topical anesthesia of the nares and nasopharynx a CO2 measuring catheter as well as a O2 catheter to administer 100% oxygen was inserted deeply into the left naris. At that time, a continous infusion of 0,05 µg/ kg/min remifentanil and 2 mg/kg/h propofol was started. After 4 min, fiberoptic intubation was performed through the right nare without any technical difficulties in conscious sedation of the patient. During the entire fiberoptic intubation SaO2 was constant at 100% and capnogram tracings with etCO2 values ranging from 31 to 33 mmHg were displayed on the monitor. At the end of this second surgical procedure with fixed pre-facial upper arm position the patient was uneventfully extubated fully awake. For the time period of fiberoptic intubation the patient had complete amnesia.
