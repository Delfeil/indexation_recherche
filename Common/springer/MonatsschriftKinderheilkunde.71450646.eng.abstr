Glutaric aciduria type I is a disease caused by deficiency of the enzyme Glutaryl CoA-Dehydogenase with an increased urinary excretion of glutaric and 3-hydroxy-glutaric acid. We report on two patients in whom glutaric aciduria type I was misdiagnosed as battered child syndrome because of subdural hygromas which are a peculiar feature of the underlying metabolic disease. The characteristic neuroradiologic manifestations of glutaric aciduria type I are illustrated. We also report on two patients who were diagnosed because of macrocephaly in the newborn period lacking neurological symptoms. They were treated at the presymptomatic stage of the disease and developed almost normally up to the age of now five and six years.
