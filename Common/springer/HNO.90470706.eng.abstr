Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent factors in tumor-induced neoangiogenesis. After binding to its specific receptors KDR and FLT-1 on the endothelial cell surface cell proliferation and migration are stimulated. Recently there has been some evidence for the expression of these receptors on tumor cells. We investigated the protein and mRNA expression of KDR and FLT-1 in native tissues and tumor cell cultures from squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) and analyzed their in vitro functional significance for tumor cell proliferation and migration. Apart from the expected expression of VEGF receptors on endothelial cells we observed a tumor cell-specific localization of FLT-1 in 29 tumors and KDR in 16 of 37 tumors analyzed. Functional studies in vitro revealed that the addition of VEGF to HNSCC cells inhibited the proliferation and migration of these cells in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggest a potential negative regulatory loop for VEGF and FLT1 when tumor cells have an insufficient blood supply.
