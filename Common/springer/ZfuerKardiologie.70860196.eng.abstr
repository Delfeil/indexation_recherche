  Introduction. To evaluate patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death the analysis of ventricular late potentials, heart rate variability and baroreflexsensitivity is helpful. However, the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy. For a better identification of high risk patients other methods are necessary. In this study the impact of the chemoreflexsensitivity for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated.
