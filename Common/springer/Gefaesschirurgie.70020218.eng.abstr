 Presently, the use of r-hirudin is limited to those indications in which the use of heparin has expected disadvantages, for example, in patients with deficiency of antithrombin III as an inborn syndrome and in those with secondary consumption following severe disturbances of coagulation. Hirudin can save lifes in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II. The systemic infusion therapy can be controlled by aPTT or better by Ecarin-time. After an arterial reconstruction operation, the danger of late bleeding must be excluded. When using r-Hirudin in fluid for local flushing of the vessel wall, one must take care to prevent a systemic effect. A particular danger is that overdosage can be induced in patients with renal failure and pharmacological antidote is yet known.
