 In 20 patients the hemodynamic and ventilatory data during endoscopic retroperitoneal adrenalectomy were checked retrospectively to analyze the hemodynamic and ventilatory effects of a pneumoretroperitoneum. After insufflation of CO2 into the retroperitoneal space we observed an increase in systolic blood pressure [median 180 mm Hg ([130-200)] . Analyzing the ventilatory parameters we noted that the minute ventilation had to be invreased by a median value of 4.25 l (0,4-13) to reduce the increased carbon dioxide levels during CO2 insufflation. After insufflation of CO2 into the retroperitoneal space we observed no major complications. We therefore believe that retroperitoneal endoscopic adrenalectomy is also indicated in patients with cardiac or pulmonary diseases.
