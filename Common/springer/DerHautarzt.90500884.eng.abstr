A 28 year old patient developed a severe bullous exanthem and enanthem combined with hepatitis, fever and blood count abnormalities after taking carbamazepine and consumption of heroin and alcohol. After discontinuing carbamazepine, prednisolone was given over a five day period accompanied by intravenous fluid and electrolyte substitution and local therapy which lead to improvement. Severe bullous skin reactions nowadays are classified into erythema exsudativum multiforme majus (EEMM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), overlap Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), TEN with maculae and TEN on large erythema, and they are most often caused by antibiotics and anticonvulsant drugs. Heroin and alcohol abuse alters host immunity which subsequently may increase susceptibility to allergic reactions. There is a high (40%) mortality rate for TEN, and patients with organ involvement are at increased risk.
