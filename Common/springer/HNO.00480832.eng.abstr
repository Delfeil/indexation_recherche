Background and objective. This study compares the results of the outpatient-based program of the Cochlear Implant Center Ruhr with inpatient-based rehabilitation, which is almost exclusively performed in Germany. Patients/methods.  The Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Essen in Germany provided 52 patients with either 22- or 24-channel Nucleus cochlear implants from March 1996 to July 1999. Almost all patients (n=49) were rehabilitated on an outpatient basis, which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside Germany.
