Background: Angiotensin converting  enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) alter the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldesterone-system, which regulates the angiotensin II synthesis. Angiotensine II is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor. ACE-inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the WHO-guidelines. The experiences concerning the use of ACE-inhibitors in pediatric patients are  limited. The frequency of side-effects are not known on a sufficient scientific basis.
