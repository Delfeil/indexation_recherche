A 44-year-old male patient with lupuserythematosus profundus (lupus panniculitis) (LEP) of the right cheek/infraorbital region presented as a recurrent swelling. He had only anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), which have not been previously described in association with LEP. There was no indication of systemic lupus erythematosus. While chloroquine produced no benefits, the skin lesions promptly cleared with dapsone. Step by step we reduced dapsone to a final dose of 50-75 mg per week. The ANCA titer decreased in parallel to the clinical improvement.
