  Although a variety of histologic entities were described, primary tumors of the trachea are rare findings. Over a period of 20 years, 30 patients underwent 31 tracheal resections in two hospitals for thoracic surgery. Among them 4 patients had thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea. In these patients a strumectomy combined with tracheal resection was performed. One re-operation for erosion bleeding of the innominate artery on the 8th postoperative day was successfully performed. All patients showed excellent long-term survival.
