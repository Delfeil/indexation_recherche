Purpose. The effect of glaucoma surgery can simply be measured in terms of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. However, IOP reduction is not the final goal of glaucoma surgery, but rather long-term visual field preservation. Visual field preservation, on the other hand, can only be judged many years after surgery. Therefore, a formula that could be used to define the success of a pressure-lowering operation soon after surgery should take account of IOP reduction, but the correlation between "successful IOP reduction" and "long-term visual field preservation" should be as high as possible.
