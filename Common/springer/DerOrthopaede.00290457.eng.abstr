The treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head involves a continuum based on a radiographic spectrum of disease. Core decompression or pharmacological agents can be utilized for the earliest small or medium-sized pre-collapsed lesions. For these types of lesions, osteotomy has been tried by various authors with moderate success. For small or medium lesions that are post-collapse, various bone grafting procedures have been used. This approach should be tempered with a look at the articular cartilage if this is damaged or the lesion is large. Limited femoral resurfacing can be used for hips that do not have acetabular involvement. If there is acetabular involvement, total hip replacement remains the treatment of choice.
