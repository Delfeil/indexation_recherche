Infectious agents may directly or indirectly (through the response of the host's immune system) modulate the growth of vascular cells. Local and/or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of (re-)stenosis in the vascular tree. Further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for atherogenesis and restenosis. Their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions.
