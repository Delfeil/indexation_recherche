Clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a rare, low-malignant bone tumor. The lesion most commonly occurs in adults, generally in the 3rd or 4th decade. Clear-cell chondrosarcoma has a predilection for the epiphyses of long tubular bones, particularly the femoral head. Radiologically, it is a sharply defined radiolucent lesion. Histologically, it is characterized by large tumor cells with distinct boundaries and a clear cytoplasm. In addition to areas of conventional chondrosarcoma, there are partially mineralized trabecular osteoid formations. On the basis of 16 cases of clear-cell chondrosarcoma, we present the observations of the Hamburg Bone Tumor Register. The cases were examined according to age distribution, location, and radiological and pathomorphological criteria. The proximal femur was the most frequent location; rare manifestations in the rib, os ilium, and distal phalanx of the hand were also present. In 50% of the cases high-malignant osteosarcoma or conventional chondrosarcoma was considered. In addition to the epiphysis of the proximal femur, clear-cell chondrosarcoma can also involve other, rather unusual sites in the skeleton. Knowledge of the histomorphology of this tumor is therefore of crucial importance for the diagnosis.
