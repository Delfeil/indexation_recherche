The management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently. Surgeons' education, preclinical rescue structures, initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies, as well as diagnostic imaging, have progressed. Plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of CT. Fast imaging techniques (spiral CT) have led to the inclusion of CT in the primary survey. To minimize the risk to the patient during prolonged diagnostic time, algorithms have to be defined concerning structures, emergency room equipment and quality. Basics, state of the art and suggestions concerning management of multiple trauma patients are presented and discussed from the radiologist's point of view.
