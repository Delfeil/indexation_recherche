Orbital pseudotumor can be divided histopathologically into three basic types: lymphoid, granulomatous and sclerosing. Chronic lymphoid and granulomatous types may eventually transform into the sclerosing type. The calcifying orbital pseudotumor is a very rare disorder due to a chronic, idiopathic inflammatory process of the orbit. The granulomatous type shows a good response to steroids while radiotherapy is the method of choice for lymphoid lesions. In general, calcifying pseudotumors can be treated only by operative exploration and tumor removal. We report a patient with a calcifying pseudotumor of the orbital apex that was removed through an endonasal approach. Preoperative diagnostic procedures and differential diagnosis are discussed.
