 The building-up of multipurpose arthritis centers in Germany led to a network including outpatient and inpatient services, primary care physicians, rheumatologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, acute care clinics, and rehabilitation centers. The structural improvement in the care of patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases has to be followed by an improvement of processes in the care of these patients and by an improvement of outcome. Coordination offices can help not only to further improve cooperation between primary care physicians, specialized rheumatologists and hospitals but also to establish a comprehensive clinical quality management.
