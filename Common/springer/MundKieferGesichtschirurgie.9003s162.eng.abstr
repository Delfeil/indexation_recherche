Since the introduction of laser therapy was developed continuously. New indications are possible in the aesthetic surgery. The laser is used for the treatment of naevi, hemangiomas, wide port-wine-stains, teleangiectasias, tatoos, epilations and skin resurfacing. To fulfill the expectations of the patients and the remands of a plastic aesthetic surgeon it is important to find the correct indication and choose the right laser. Vascular and pigmental disorders can be successfully treated with the flash lamp pumped pulsed dye laser. Laser containing different wave lengths are available. For the treatment of the aged skin the Ultrapuls-CO2-Laser offers advantages in comparison with the Erbium-YAG-Laser. However these lasers can not replace a facelift or blepharoplasty.
