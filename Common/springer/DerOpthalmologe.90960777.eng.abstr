Objective: Resistance against the anticoagulatory effect of activated protein C (APC) is the most common genetic risk factor for venous thromboembolism. In the industrialized nations, the prevalence is 4-7 % of heterozygous symptom carriers and 0.04 % individuals with homozygous defect. The hereditary form is conditioned by a single-point mutation in factor V gene, whose molecular characterization became available in 1994. The fact that so far there are no reports about this specific disease in the German literature signifies a lack in the diagnosis of thromboembolic diseases.
