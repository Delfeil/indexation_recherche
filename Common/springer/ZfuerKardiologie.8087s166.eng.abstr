  Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is a clinical problem associated with major ischemic events or repeat interventions in 20-50% of the treated patients. Systemic drug therapy has not yet been shown to prevent restenosis in clinical conditions. However, local therapeutic strategies are evolving, such as the catheter-based delivery of drugs, of antiproliferative genes, or of ionizing radiation. Experimental studies show that radiation therapy reduces restenosis rates, and preliminary clinical trials investigating a small number of patients indicate that, in particular, catheter-based radiation may be safe and effective. Randomized multicenter studies with long follow-up periods are needed to support these early results.
