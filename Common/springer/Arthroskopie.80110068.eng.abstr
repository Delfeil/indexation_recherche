Biomechanically correct positioning of the replacement material is vital for a successful operation in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery. However, intra-articular fixation of the ACL to the anatomic origin and insertion has not yet been performed using any surgical technique. The transtibial canal is the principle underlying all previous ACL reconstruction operations. External fixation at such a distance exerts substantial strain on the graft in the tibial canal. This strain is due to a "windshield-wiper motion" occurring with each extension and flexion of the knee. Detrimental shearing forces at the graft's point of exit additionally weaken the replacement material. The all-inside technique is an innovative development in arthroscopic ACL surgery which obviates the need for a transtibial canal and fixes the graft anatomically correctly to the femoral origin and tibial insertion. The way in which the lateral third of the patellar tendon is excised is new. No patellar bone core is removed. Thus long-term post-operative patellar pain, which is otherwise frequent, does not occur. The chief advantages of the all-inside technique are as follows: anatomic graft fixation to the origin and insertion of the ACL; no graft overloading in a transtibial canal, shear stresses and the windshield-wiper effect are eliminated; a dorsally open, tibial fixation angle of the graft, which counteracts ventral translation forces of the tibia; simplified revision possibilities; and a lower morbidity rate.
