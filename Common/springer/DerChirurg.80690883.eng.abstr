 Non-traumatic duodenocaval fistulae are rare, but may be the source of massive gastrointestional bleeding with associated fever and sepsis. These fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen. The outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs. The therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava. We describe the seventh case with radiogenic duodenal ulcer. Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred 10 years after radical nephrectomy and radiation (60 Gy). The patient survived following partial pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple).
