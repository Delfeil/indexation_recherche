The case of a 30-year-old patient is reported who presented with a right-sided amaurosis fugax and a simultaneous frontobasal fracture that had occurred after a fall. By CT angiography and MRI angiography obstruction of the ophthalmic artery following a dissection of the internal carotid artery with ascending thrombosis could be  demonstrated. There was a lack of further neurological deficits because of sufficient perfusion of the cerebral arteries by the arterial circle of the cerebrum. Among the etiological variety of types of post-traumatic amaurosis, this rare cause should be taken into consideration in the etiology, diagnosis and therapy, if appropriate.
