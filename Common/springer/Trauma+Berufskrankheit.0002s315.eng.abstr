A change of treatment modality in osteosynthesis is based on one of two principles. On the one hand, fixation can be performed as part of a two-step procedure to reduce the side effects of fracture stabilization. On the other hand, a revision osteosynthesis may be required for the treatment of complications. Indications for a two-step procedure are fractures in polytraumatized patients and fractures with a tendency to swelling and infection (pilon-tibial fractures). External fixator devices applied in a two-step procedure were used for stabilization of fractures involving severe soft tissue damage in past decades; unreamed nailing is now commonly preferred. Revision osteosynthesis may be appropriate in the treatment of complications. Such complications can be caused by failure of the osteosynthesis; they can also be due to delayed union or nonunion of fractures, osseous defects or infection. In the case of failed osteosynthesis the reasons for failure must be thoroughly studied and a variety of subsequent procedures considered for successful treatment.
