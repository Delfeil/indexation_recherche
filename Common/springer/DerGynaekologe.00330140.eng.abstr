ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) has been shown to effectively help couples, even in cases of severe male factor infertility. In this paper, we concentrate on new and developing techniques which might help to improve fertilization and pregnancy rates in problematic cases. We discuss the possibility of in vitro maturation of spermatogenetic cells in patients suffering from maturation arrest who currently  only have the chance to conceive by elongated or round spermatid injection - if those cells are available at all. The re-transplantation of spermatogenetic cells in patients following chemotherapy, e.g., for Hodgkin's disease, might help to restore their natural fertility. Couples with chromosomal abnormalities are also considered problematic cases. There is still ongoing discussion whether these couples have a lower chance of fertilization and implantation, besides the risk of transmission of chromosomal abnormalities to their offspring. The problematic cases of Klinefelter's syndrome are especially discussed. Finally, cytoplasmic donation and reproductive cloning are discussed, regarding technical perspectives as well as the ethical problems arising from these techniques, which may be able to help couples who are classified as untreatable by other techniques.
