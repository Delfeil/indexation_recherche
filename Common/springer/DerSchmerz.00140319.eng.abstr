Phenomenon pain. While pain is one of the main reasons for an unscheduled visit to the paediatrician, pain due to painful procedures is of major importance in scheduled visits. Actual pain therapy is illustrated in the treatment of burns. Incomplete analgesia may have an unfavourable impact on morbidity and mortality. The pain score does not correlate with the extent of the burned area, and is regularly underestimated. General anaesthesia or analgo-sedation are warranted during the care of the burned patient.
