Background: The recently described "APC resistance" caused by a mutant form of factor V (factor V Leiden) is the most frequent cause of hereditary thrombosis. This study was carried out to investigate the association between activated protein C resistance and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). We evaluated the prevalence of APC resistance in patients with CRVO, patients with a history of deep-vein thrombosis, and a healthy control group.
