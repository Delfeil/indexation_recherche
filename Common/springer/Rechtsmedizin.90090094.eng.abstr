 We reviewed 114 fatalities investigated at the Institute of Legal Medicine of Zurich from 1989 to 1997 where methadone was detected. Of these 44 persons were enrolled in a methadone program at the time of death. Polydrug toxicity was the leading cause of death (n = 73) and the most frequently abused drugs were benzodiazepines, alcohol and opioids. In 25 cases the autopsy revealed another cause of death (e.g. infection, freezing to death) and 12 cases could be related to a "methadone only" intoxication (relative overdose). In four cases death was the result of mechanical violence (traffic accident, strangulation, fall, shooting). No person died during a strictly regulated methadone program.
