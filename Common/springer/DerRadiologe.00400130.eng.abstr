Purpose: Assessment of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency with computed tomography methods has been demonstrated as an alternative to coronary angiography. The evaluation of the bypass anastomoses is still of limited success. Prospective ECG triggering of conventional CT scanners al- lows heart phase-triggered single-slice acquisition in the sub-second range. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the use of ECG triggering can optimize the evaluation of proximal CABG anastomoses.
