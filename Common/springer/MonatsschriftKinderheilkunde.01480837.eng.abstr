Case report: We report on three female patients with myelomeningocele, Chiari II malformation and severe respiratory control disorder despite neurosurgery. After life-threatening events (two patients) and negative weaning (one patient) we decided a longterm home-care ventilation at the age of 5 months, 3.1 respectively 10.1 years of age. Patients were ventilated by a pressure-controlled ventilator via nasal mask (one patient) respectively by a volume-controlled ventilator via tracheostoma (two patients). Over a period of 2.7 respectively 5.2 years we could prevent two patients from life-threatening events. During a follow-up of 7.3 years our third patient suffered from a prolonged convulsion, which led to a severe neurologic deterioration. Two of the three patients showed a positive neurologic development and social integration.
