The Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) has first been described in 1972. The characteristic features with variable penetrance and expression are: anorectal malformations - sensoneural deafness - satyr ears - polydactyly - triphalangeal thumb anomaly. A mother, her daughter, and son show the typical, variable phenotypic signs of TBS. The autosomal dominant inheritance as stated in the literature, can be shown in two generations of this pedigree.
