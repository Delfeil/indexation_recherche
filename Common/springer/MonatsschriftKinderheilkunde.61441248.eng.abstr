In the past, home made preparations of phenylalanine free aminoacid mixtures, oil and carbohydrates have been used in this country for the dietary treatment of infants with phenylketonuria (PKU). Recently ready-to-use phenylalanine free diets for infants have become available which promise marked advantages for use in partially breastfed infants with PKU. In a pilotstudy we evaluated acceptance and nutrient supply of such a therapeutic infant diet (PKU-1-Mix, Milupa, Germany) in four partially breastfed infants with PKU previously supplemented with a home made diet. The infants' parents judged the taste of the formula (on a scale from 1 = very good to 6 = unacceptable) with an average score of 2.3, much better than that for the conventional diet (5.0). They reported an improved drinking behaviour of their babies and less time required for the preparation of the meal (7.0 vs. 26.3 minutes/feeding). We calculated the average nutrient intake during the three weeks before and after the dietary change. The mean daily food consumption increased from 121,7 ml/kg bodyweight to 132,6 ml/kg, due for an increased consumption of the phenylalanine free diet. Calories/kg intake rose ( + 19 %) even more markedly, protein equivalents/kg + 9 %, calcium + 65 % and zink + 39 %. We conclude that the use of this ready-to-use phenylalanine free diet markedly improves dietary treatment of partially breastfed infants with PKU.
