Skin grafting is one of the earliest described surgical procedures. In the age of microsurgery and free-tissue transfer, it remains a utilitarian means of achieving soft tissue reconstruction. Free skin grafts can be classified into three types: full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness skin grafts, and composite grafts. The indications, techniques, donor site considerations, postoperative complications, and results of each type are reviewed. The full-thickness skin graft for facial and cervical reconstruction is usually harvested from the upper arm or postauricular region and is applied under a tie-over dressing. When comparing the functional and aesthetic results of full-thickness skin grafts and split-thickness skin grafts in terms of morbidity, skin elasticity, skin sensitivity, matching, and scar recurrence, full-thickness skin grafting seems to be the most adequate technique.
