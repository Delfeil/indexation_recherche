 Bacterial infections still pose a threat to intensive care patients. The progression of an infection once contracted often leads to severe sepsis with subsequent organ failure and death. Despite better understanding of the pathophysiological course, the hyperinflammatory reaction cannot be retained. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) regulates the multiplication and differentiation of neutrophil precursors and modulates neutrophil function. Since 1987, recombinant human G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) has been approved for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, all forms of congenital neutropenia, as well as for the mobilization of progenitor cells for peripheral progenitor cell transplantation. Since G-CSF modulates the function of neutrophil granulocytes and since its endogenous production is induced by bacterial infection, it has been assumed to have an important role in bacterial infections. In animal models of infections it has been shown that rhG-CSF could significantly increase the survival rates and reduced the endogenous production of TNF-. In healthy volunteers G-CSF improves the granulocyte function and has an anti-inflammatory effect on the cytokine network. First clinical studies in patients with infections (pneumonia) as well as surgical intensive care patients have shown that the administration of G-CSF is safe and that it might have a beneficial effect on the clinical course.
