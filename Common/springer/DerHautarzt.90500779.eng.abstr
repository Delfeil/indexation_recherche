Congenital melanocytic nevi are benign skin tumours with a population-based prevalence of 1-6%. They run an increased life-time risk of transformation into malignant melanoma. Additionally, they can be associated with an involvement of the leptomeninges (neurocutaneous melanosis), and may cause considerable cosmetic and psychic problems. In contrast to the past, the risk of congenital melanocytic nevi developing into melanoma is now regarded as well-established. Thus, excision is recommended whenever possible. Large lesions which do not allow complete excision should be treated by dermabrasion within the first weeks of life.
