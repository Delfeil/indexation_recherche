Operative repair in ruptures of the extensor mechanism of the knee joint mostly requires additional external or internal fixation by plaster, transfer of tendons or encircling wires. Reconstruction of initially undiagnosed ruptures has to solve the problems of fixed proximal or distal migration of the patella and tendenous shortening. This can be performed with a tibiopatellar external fixator which allows gradually reduction of the patella in an anatomical position before operative reconstruction by suturing or reinsertion. During this period as well as a postoperative protection this fixator enables patients to maintain motion of the knee joint and full weightbearing. This technique can avoid poor functional results caused by long periods of immobilisation and is helpful in patients with marked displacement of the patella and inability to manually reduce the patella distally when delayed repair is necessitated.
