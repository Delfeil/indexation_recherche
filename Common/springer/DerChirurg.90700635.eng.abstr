 Over a period of 12 years, 73 patients received a continent ileostomy. 19 Kock pouches were primarily constructed due to contraindications against the ileoanal pouch, 30 ileostomies were converted due to psychological rejection of the incontinent stoma and 9 ileoanal pouches for dysfunction. 15 Kock pouches had to be corrected for nipple valve complications. Perioperative complications (14/73) were related to the Kock pouch in only one third of cases. Surgical late complications of the nipple valve function decreased with technical modifications from 41.1 % to 20.0 % and then to 4.8 %. They could always be dealt with surgically. Pouchitis was observed in 26.8 % of cases of ulcerative colitis (11/41), and in 6/15 patients with Crohn's disease (40.0 %) complicated ileal recurrences developed. The definitive rate of success over the time was 98.1 % in ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis (53/54) and 63.2 % in other conditions (12/19). Continent ileostomy has become universal and safe method for conversion of any previous operation.
