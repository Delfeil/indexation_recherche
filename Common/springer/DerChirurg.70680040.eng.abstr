 In recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) in otherwise healthy adults. It is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about 30 %. This paper describes the history of two patients with severe streptococcal TSLS. Various aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy are discussed. Only early, aggressive and repeated surgical debridement can reduce the bacterial load and decrease circulating exotoxins and thereby, in combination with antibiotic therapy, decrease the high mortality of this entity.
