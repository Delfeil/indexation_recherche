In patients with a significant elongation of the ACL we propose a new therapeutic regimen. After mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the ACL we pull the bone block with the attached ACL distally. Thus the ACL is easily tightened. In accordance with this method, we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the ACL: the tibial insertion is mobilised, the bone block with the attached ACL removed from the joint. Ex vivo sutures are placed into the ACL, the ligament is pulled back into the joint, and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block.
