Germany has a longstanding tradition of human milk banking. With modern screening methods, contamination of donor milk has been largely eliminated. The milk banks are able to supply pasteurized and deep-frozen donor milk to recipients whose physicians order it. There is a low incidence of NEC. Because the composition of milk from preterm mothers is uniquely suited to the needs of premature infants, this milk is preferred.
