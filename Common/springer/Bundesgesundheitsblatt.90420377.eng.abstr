Travel medicine in Germany is getting more important, but also more complex in view of increasing worldwide tourism, the unbroken keenness of Germans to travel, new vaccines, changed travel habits and the altered epidemiological situation of several infectious agents. Qualified health information requires extensive specialized knowledge and up-to-date, differentiated information about travel destinations. The quality of the manifold counselling services varies considerably, and it is often difficult for the traveller seeking medical advice to make judgements about the quality of counselling. Possible solutions for the improvement of quality and transparancy in this field are seen - amongst others - in the further development of quality standards, the certification and publication of qualified information and in a closer cooperation between travel agencies, pharmacies and physicians.
