In a retrospective analysis of 299 consecutive patients with degenerative cervical spine disease the incidence of cervicogenic headache and the results of conservative and operative therapy have been investigated. Cervicogenic headache was noted in 117 of 299 patients (40%). 73 of those patients were treated conservatively. The cervicogenic headache resolved in 10% or improved in 27% and remained unchanged in 63% of the patients. 44 of these patients were operated by ventral discectomy, which was indicated in case of neurological deficit and painful shoulder-arm syndrome refractory to conservative treatment. In none of these patients the operation was indicated by the cervicogenic headache. In the postoperative follow-up with a mean of 6 months the headache resolved in 20%, improved in 60% and remained unchanged in 20% of the patients. These results suggest the existence of a cervicogenic headache, i.e. a headache due to disorders of the cervical spine, and the chance of successful operative treatment.
