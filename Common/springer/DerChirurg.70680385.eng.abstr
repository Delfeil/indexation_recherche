A 41-year-old patient with liver cirrhosis due to autoimmune hepatitis received an emergency transjugular portosystemic stent shunt for uncontrolled acute variceal hemorrhage. Because of markedly impaired liver function, liver transplantation was considered to be indicated and was performed on the following day. Intraoperatively, one of the intrahepatic metal stents migrated unnoticed into the pulmonary artery. The postoperative course was uncomplicated and the displaced stent was left in situ. Eighteen months after the transplantation the patient is well with normal liver function and no pulmonary problems.
