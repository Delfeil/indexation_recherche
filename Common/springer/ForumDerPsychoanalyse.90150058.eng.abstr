 This paper considers the current relationship between psychoanalysis and neuroscience. In this second part of the paper, it is argued that developments in this school of neurology since Freud's death, specifically the work of Aleksandr Lurija, have made it possible for fruitful contact between psychoanalysis and neuroscience to be re-established, on a sound clinical-scientific basis. The compatibility between Freud's conceptualisation of mental dynamics and that of modern dynamic neuropsychology is illustrated through an example: The neurological organisation of dreaming, which is the paradigmatic mental function of psychoanalysis.
