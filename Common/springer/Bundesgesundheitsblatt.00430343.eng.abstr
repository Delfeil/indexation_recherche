Until today the "Environment and Health" action program (APUG = Aktionsprogramm "Umwelt und Gesundheit") is not well known, neither by the public nor by the media. At the expert level only complex relationships and general points of view have been discussed. Among other actions an evaluated electronic information tool with the aim to facilitate the tasks to be performed by APUG should promote a broad public participation and initiate concrete actions on the local level. Thus it will provide the essential flow of information between the public and Environmental Health professionals.
