A 7-year-old otherwise healthy girl presented with a 2-year history of an ILVEN (inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus) located on the inner part of her right upper arm. The diagnosis was histologically confirmed. Different conservative therapeutic strategies with corticosteroids, antibiotics and antimycotics produced little or no improvement. Because of encouraging reports describing the successful use of 0.005% calcipotriol ointment in patients with ILVEN, we treated our patient with this regimen. After 4 weeks we could recognize a impressive improvement and after 8 weeks the ILVEN had nearly completely disappeared. 25 weeks after withdrawal of calcipotriol, no relapse had occurred. The dramatic response to calcipotriol suggests some pathological links between ILVEN and psoriasis.
