A 31-year-old woman was found dead with a peripheral venous access in the back of her left hand. The post-mortem examination revealed extensive blisters which contained a serosanguinous fluid and extremely demarcated cutaneouns veins were observed completely covering the upper left limb. Signs of autolysis were absent corresponding to the short lapse of time since death (a maximum of 24 h). Toxicological analysis revealed the presence of the barbiturate thiopental in blood and a high thiopental concentration of 1025 µg/ml was detected in the blister fluid which exceeded the venous blood concentration (5.35 µg/ml) by almost 200-fold. It was concluded that part of the thiopental infusion had been incorporated after circulatory arrest and therefore remained deposited in the left arm. The results indicate that barbiturate-induced vascular damage and blister formation in the present case had occurred in the supravital or early post-mortem period as a purely local phenomenon. Extreme care should be taken when evaluating blisters as a vital reaction. The analysis of various body fluids available in a case should be used for characterization of local and systemic distributions of the barbiturate involved.
