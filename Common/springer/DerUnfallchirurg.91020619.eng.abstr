Although children are injured everyday through accidents, road traffic, leisure or sports activities, internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare. Diagnose and therapy follow rather empirical than analytical patterns. A retrospective, controlled study evaluates and recommends ways of treatment. Traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in 76 children up to age 16. The pattern of injury changed with increasing age, the trauma remaining the same. Most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Main cause where sports activities. Operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment. Osseous avulsions of the cruciates and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture. Suturing of intraligamentous ACL-ruptures as well as patellar ligaments plasty showed unsatisfactory results. Secondary lesions due to instability of the knee where also observed in children. Children cannot self estimate the severity of the injury so subjective statements are insecure. Trauma, surgery, pain and immobilisation cause a marked malfunction of the senso-motor system which is effectively treated by physiotherapy.
