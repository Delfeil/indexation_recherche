 Contrast media-associated nephrotoxicity continues to be a relevant cause of acute renal failure especially in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency. Alterations in renal hemodynamics and direct tubular toxicity by contrast media are the primary factors believed to be responsible for contrast media-associated nephrotoxicity. We review recent insights into the pathogenesis of this complication and summarize prophylactic strategies focusing on hydration, vasoactive pharmacological agents, alternative contrast media, and "prophylactic hemodialysis".
