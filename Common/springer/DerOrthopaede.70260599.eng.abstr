The precise preoperative clinical and electrophysiological evaluation of the brachial plexus as well as an exact rediological evaluation are the keystones for the treatment of traumatic injuries of the brachial plexus. Furthermore, surgical management and prognosis of traction injuries of the brachial plexus depend on the accurate diagnosis of root avulsion from the spinal cord. Myelography, myelo-computed tomography and recently magnetic resonance imaging are the main radiological methods for preoperative diagnose of cervical root avulsions. Surgical experience shows that in may cases, extraspinal findings diverge from intradural findings. Consequently, only correlation with the intradural surgical findings will allow us to define the factual accuracy of myelo-CT and MRI studies. Accuracy of the preoperative myelo-CT based diagnosis related to the intraoperative intradural findings was 85 %. On the other hand, MRI showed an accuarcy of only 52 %. Therefore, myelo-CT scans with 1 to 3 mm axial slices proves to be the most reliable method to evaluate preoperatively the presence of complete or partial root avulsion in traumatic brachial plexus injuries. However in 15 % of the cases preoperative exact radiological diagnosis is unfortunately not reliable. In these special cases intraspinal surgical exposure of the cervical roots will provide the accurate diagnosis of root avulsion. Accurate clinical evaluation and exact assessment of intraspinal root avulsion simplify enormously the decision concerning the choice of donor nerves for transplantation and/or neurotization during brachial plexus surgery.
