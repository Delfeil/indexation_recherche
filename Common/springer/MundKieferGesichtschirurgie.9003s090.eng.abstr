After the resection of a tumor, many patients need a reconstruction with hard and soft tissue and also with sufficient dentures. Often, only little space is available for the implantation. Implant length and diameter have to be reduced, and the result is a change in the biomechanics with a possible mechanical overloading of the implant. We examined 52 tumor patients undergoing reconstruction with 189 implants. A new concept involving attachment with the help of magnets is presented, offering a satisfactory solution in these difficult cases after tumor resection and reconstruction.
