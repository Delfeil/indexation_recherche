 Since there are clear concerns about anesthesia in emergency medicine, physicians have been interviewed concerning its application in a prehospital setting. Forty-four percent of emergency doctors were anesthesists with several years experience in emergency medicine and anesthesia. In 61% of cases anesthesia was performed in traumatic patients where babiturates were used in 55%. While Ketamine is used in the hospital in only 5%, it is used in 16% in a prelinical setting. Fifty-three percent of emergency doctors do use muscle relaxation and 47% not at all. If it was used, suxamethonium was the most used muscle relaxant (39%). Advantages and disadvantages of alternative narcotics are discussed with special focus on its usefulness in a preclinical setting. It is concluded that anesthesia in emergency medicine needs to be intensified in the training of emergency doctors.
