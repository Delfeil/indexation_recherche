Baker, Norlin, Hintermann and  Arciero have described the arthroscopic findings in first-time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation (FTASD) in a homogeneously aged population. There is no report of arthroscopic findings in other age groups, taking into consideration the time elapsed from the initial traumatic episode. A prospective study of 48 patients suffering a complete FTASD have been arthroscopically examined and documented. Arthroscopy was performed within 6 weeks of the traumatic episode (group 1) or subacutely after 6 weeks in case of persistent pain and apprehension (group 2). To study the effect of age, patients were divided between those under and those over 32 years of age. All groups demonstrated high numbers of laberal detachments. Group 1 shows no instances of labral destruction and the lowest rate of labral substance lesions (40%). However, this group revealed the highest rate of IGHL detachment (insertion site), Hill-Sachs-Lesions and glenoid rim defects. There was a significant difference in IGHL substance lesion between acute (group 1) and subacute (group 2) cases (P = 0.0485) as well as in IGHL scar formation (P = 0.0052). Group 2 also showed a statistical higher rate of labrum destruction (P = 0.078). Patients older than 32 years showed the highest percentage of partial and complete rotator cuff tears and rotator interval biceps pully lesions. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study which documents the arthroscopic intraarticular pathology in cases of FTASD, also taking into account patient age and time interval from injury. Although patient numbers were small, certain trends appear to emerge. Young patients with FTASD show high percentages of labrum and IGHL detachment, whereas substance defects in these structures were low. Persistent pain and apprehension after initial dislocation appears to be related to substance lesions of the labrum and of IGHL (group 2). As anticipated, more and marked rotator cuff lesions were found in patients > 32 than in patients <= 32 years. An unexpectedly high rate of partial rotator cuff lesions (25%) was detected in patients <= 32 years.
