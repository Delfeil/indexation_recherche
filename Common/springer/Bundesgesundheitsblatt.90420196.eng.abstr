To assess the epidemiological situation of salmonellosis in Germany a total of 1608 strains of salmonella sampled in a sentinel-study were isolated and typed. The results on occurrence, distribution, types and antbiotic resistance of salmonella were compared with both the strains forwarded to the National Reference Center (NRC) for Salmonellosis for typing from all regions of Germany and the strains notified according to the duty of notification in the five new Länder (federal countries) and Berlin.
