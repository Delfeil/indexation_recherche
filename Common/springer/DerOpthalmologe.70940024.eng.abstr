The implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses (PCL) leads to greater trauma to the eye than endocapsular PCL implantation. Persistent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long-term prognosis. Using laser-tyndallometry, we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long-term postoperative course for both surgical procedures. During the first 3 postoperative days, flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured PCL than in the conventional PCL group. Cell counts after transscleral suture fixation (27.7 +/- 18.3/0.075 mm3) decreased slightly during the first 5 postoperative days. In contrast, the conventional PCL group regained the preoperative level (2.5 +/- 5.1) after 3 days. After 3 months, no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups. After implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses, breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional PCL implantation. However, the barrier function was re-established equally in both groups in the long term. No signs of a persistent disorder of the barrier were found.
