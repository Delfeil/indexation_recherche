In this study we compare the results of various methods of treatment in 159 patients who were operated on between 1980 and 1990 for scaphoid pseudarthrosis at the Budapest Central Institute for Traumatology. Rated subjectively, 84 % of the results of the Russe-I plasty were regarded as good, as were 75% of the spongiosaplasty, 88 % of the Ender plate synthesis, and 75 % of the AO navicular screw. Of the palliative methods retaining movement, denervation with styloidectomy yielded good results. Silicon prosthesis and proximal pole resection only led to temporary improvement. In patients with severe radiocarpal arthrosis who do heavy work, even today radiocarpal stiffening is regarded as the procedure of choice. In our experience, the best functional results can be expected when immobilization is as short as possible and fixation as stable as possible - which corresponds to Ender plate synthesis according to our results.
