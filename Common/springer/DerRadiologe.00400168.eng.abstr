Background: Echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease. The good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects. Dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant jets are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies.
