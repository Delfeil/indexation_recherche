Asymptomatic microhematuria is a common reason for a urological consultation. Uncertainty prevails as to how meticulous the work-up must be, to not miss relevant or even life-threatening underlying diseases.

There are various potential examinations that can be applied, ranging from a clinical examination to a kidney biopsy.
