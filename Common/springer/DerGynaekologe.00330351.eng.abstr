Since the mid-1980s, various research groups have tried to improve the prediction of preterm deliveries by immunological diagnostics, especially by measurements of cytokines. It has been shown that inflammatory cytokines correlated well with prepartal infection and preterm delivery. However, in contrast to the serum cytokine levels of pregnant women, only the prenatal diagnostics using amnion fluid samples (i. e., amniocentesis) revealed reliable results. This finding might be due to the cytokine-impermeable placental barrier that could be shown in placenta perfusion experiments. Furthermore, the levels of cytokines are characterized by a great variety of different mediators. These problems have led to alternative detection methods and development of cytokine patterns. Especially, current work is focused on cytokine measurements in cervical samples of pregnant women using PCR technology.
