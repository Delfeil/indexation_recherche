Abstract.  Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmHg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria. In primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis, ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma. Secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery. The effects are decreased cardiac output, pulmonary atelectasis, oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion. Effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure. Normal values are between 0 and 7 cm H2O, after elective laparotomies 5-12 cm H20. Above 25 cm H20 they are definitely pathological. For the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended. Between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in 377 patients. In 16 % of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31  +/-  4 cm H20 preoperatively, which could be lowered to 17  +/-  4 cm H20 by laparostomy. An early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18 % of the cases. Conclusions: The abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems. The temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances.
