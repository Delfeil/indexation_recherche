The long-standing consultant service for neurological patients in a general hospital requires questions to about the dimensions and efficiency of being answered cooperation between a general hospital and a neighbouring neurological clinic with a casualty ward and neuroradiology. From 1987 to 1995, 1471 patients with neurological diagnoses were observed retrospectively. The small number of requested consultancies (4-5%) was conspicious related to the total member of patients treated in the general hospital. About 25% of the recommendations of the consultants were realized. The percentage of pensioners and housewives was distinctly higher (45%). With the help of the diagnosis "concussion of the brain" good cooperation was observed between the general physicians to whom the consultant's recommendations had been passed on and the neurological casualty ward. The results, tendencies and possibilities for improvement of interdisciplinary cooperation are discussed.
