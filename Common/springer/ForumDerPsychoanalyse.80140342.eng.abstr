 The author discusses critically the "extension" of psychoanalysis through "body-therapeutical elements" by Tilmann Moser. She demonstrates on the basis of the publications of Moser on this topic, especially of his didactical films about psychoanalysis and body work, how some acts between therapist and patient which are to understand sexually and are also experienced as such, are systematically reinterpreted by Moser as "preverbal" and "preoedipal". This reinterpretation leads to the manipulative confusion of the patient and corresponds to the structure of abuse sceneries. Theoretical reflections about healing phantasies and about the concept of abstinence in psychoanalysis follow and on their basis the thesis is substantiated, that psychoanalysis and body-therapy are incompatible concepts.
