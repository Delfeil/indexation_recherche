High-frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent - among others - two treatment options in hypoxemic respiratory failure of neonates. We report the case of a term infant with meconium aspiration syndrome, who only responded favorably to inhaled nitric oxide following the initiation of high-frequency ventilation. At an oxygenation index of 17 we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right-to-left shunting and improve oxygenation. How- ever the respiratory situation did not improve, the oxygenation index increased to 25. After discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to HFV with mean airway pressures of 15 mbar. Again oxyena-tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile 31. At that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of 10 ppm while continuing high-frequency ventilation. Immediately oxygenation improved significantly, the oxygenation index decreased to 9 within several minutes after restarting nitric oxide. This effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high-frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from iNO could be performed.
