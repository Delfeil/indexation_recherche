 Pulmonary sequestrations have no communication with the bronchial tree. Therefore they are usually airless. However, in the presence of a fistula to the esophagus or the stomach, they might contain air or could even be emphysematic. Such a case in a newborn is presented. This very rare anomaly is frequently named "communicating bronchopulmonary foregut malformation". This malformation has to be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic lung diseases. Diagnosis can be made preoperatively by esophagography and Doppler sonography.
