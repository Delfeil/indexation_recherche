 The surgical treatment of varicous veins demands complete exclusion of the primary recirculation circuit. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms, on i.e. morphologic and functional signs. If there is saphenous vein agreement between them, phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation. The prospective comparative examination of non-invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12% of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3% for the small with a correction of the operative procedure. In 10 cases of incomplete trunk varicosis, only one diagnosis was correct with non-invasive measures. This leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms.
