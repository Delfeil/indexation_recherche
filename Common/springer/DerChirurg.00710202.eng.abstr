Abstract.  Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis, e. g. early elective resection and primary anastomosis. Methods: The data of 445 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified Hinchey classification (stages 0-III). Results: Within our study group the morbidity was 26.5 % (n = 118) and the mortality was 1.6 % (n = 7). In 96 % (n = 425) of all cases and in 64 % (21/33) of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis (stage III), a primary anastomosis was performed. Four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis (0.9 %). No leakage was observed from any of the anastomoses performed in stage III diverticulitis. Stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality. Some 53 % (94/177) of the patients in stage II and 67 % (22/33) of the patients in stage III had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before. Conclusion: Prophylactic surgery to avoid life-threatening situations, including abscess formation or perforation, is not possible in many cases. However, especially patients at risk (age, coexisting illness) should undergo early surgery. Primary anastomosis can be performed safely even at an advanced stage.
