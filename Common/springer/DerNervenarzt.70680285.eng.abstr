The tethered spinal cord syndrome is more often encountered in children, but does also occur in adults. Its clinical spectrum comprises low back pain, neurological deficits such as distal motor weakness and trophic and sensory disturbances in the legs, urological symptoms and such musculoskeletal signs as scoliosis or foot deformities. In addition, cutaneous lesions or subcutaneous lipomas in the lumbosacral region may be indirect signs of an intraspinal pathology. This consists in a tight, thickened and sometimes shortened filum terminale, an intraspinal lipoma, intradural scar formation or other lesions that lead to conus fixation. The common mechanism of injury of these types of pathologies is an impairment of longitudinal movement of the spinal cord, especially the conus medullaris, which subsequently leads to chronic local ischemia. Diagnosis is most readily achieved by magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment is aimed at the restoration of cord mobility by means of microsurgical release of the conus, the cauda equina and the filum terminale with the aid of cauda equina neuromonitoring. Further progression can be effectively halted; in fact almost half of the patients actually improve. Therefore, every patient presenting with the clinical diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome should be offered specialized surgical treatment.
