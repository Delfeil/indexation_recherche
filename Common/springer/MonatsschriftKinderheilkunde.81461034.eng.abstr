The association of congenital hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia has been listed as a rare autosomal dominant disorder (MIM 146255) with variable expressivity. We report on a new family with hypoparathyroidism causing tetanic spasms in the father but not in his son; both father and son had a non-progressive sensorineural hearing deficit for high frequencies since early childhood; there was chronic, compensated renal insufficiency in the father, and severe renal dysplasia causing renal failure from the first year of life in the son. Interestingly, father and son had a supernumerary marker chromosome identified by FISH as a dicentric chromosome 22q11. The marker had arisen de novo in the father and was not present in any other family member except for his son.
