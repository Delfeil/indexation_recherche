Twenty-one patients were evaluated with an average follow up of 30 month after arthroscopical reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament using the IKDC-Evaluation Document, Lysholm-Score, KT 1000 and X-ray. Complex ligament injuries and chronic instability of the knee were the indications for operative treatment. Semitendinosus - or patella ligament autografts were used. The Lysholm-Score significantly improved preoperatively to postoperatively (p < 0.01). The IKDC revealed 11 patients for group B, 7 patients for group C and 3 patients for group D. The KT1000 measurement showed a postoperative drawer of 3.6 mm compared with the nonoperated side. Thirteen of the 21 patients showed a posterior drawer of less than 3 mm. The lateral posterior stress view of the X-ray revealed a 4.1 mm (  +/-  2.9 mm) side to side difference postoperatively in comparison to 9.5 mm (  +/-  3.5 mm) preoperatively. Three patients possessed radiological signs of osteoarthritis grad I by Ahlbäck. Our results recommend in patients with complex PCL-injuries as well as in cases of chronic posterior instability a complex reconstruction of the ligaments.
