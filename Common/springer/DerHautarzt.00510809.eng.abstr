The object of this review is to give a structured report of different pulsed laser and laser-like systems (Epilight, Photoderm, long-pulsed ruby-, alexandrite- and diodelaser) that are available in Germany, including their side effects and complications.The current status of scientific investigation in this field is discussed.
