In this very personal communication the author, independently of affiliations to a particular psychotherapeutic school of thought, attempts to illuminate ways in which, certain characteristics inherent in the professionalisation of psychotherapy can lead to various forms of alienation as well as an impairment of the therapist's capacity for genuine interpersonal encounters. He advocates the restitution of a concept of the human being which, more explicitly than is the case in most of the theories of psychotherapeutic medicine, actively acknowledges the status of every human being as part of a superordinate order - Nature as a whole - and as an explorer actively engaged in enhancing his/her own art of living. A scientifically grounded form of counselling based on the concept of salutogenesis can to be regarded as having the same potential value as curative psychotherapy itself. If we investigate people's genuine creative power and their capacity for development, the common diagnostic tools and frequently schematic approaches of the profession may be helpful, but of ten counterproductive. Many selective instruments used by the therapeutic professions, for example the advisory screening and report practices employed by the health insurance schemes, actively divert attention away from the art of living. They involve the risk of simplistic classification, pathologization and possibly even exploitation of people seeking psychotherapeutic aid. As a corrective to this tendency, the author suggests focussing therapeutic attention more consistently on the question of how to achieve a heightened awareness of the elementary somato-mental life-energy of the individual patient. The steady cultivation of one's own ability to love is part and parcel of this process. The therapist's awareness of the potential for self-experience and self-expression through artistic activity can be helpful in acquiring a broadly developed ability for interpersonal response. This self-experience must then be integrated into psychotherapeutic practice as completely as possible. The members of the helping profession should ask themselves from time to time to what extent they are likely to be perceived by others as masters in the art of living.
