Currently 2D time-of-flight MR angiography (MRA) is most commonly used for the evaluation of the extremities. The major limitation is their susceptibility to signal loss from intravoxel phase dispersion. This leads to overestimation in the grading of stenoses. Further difficulties are motion artifacts and the limited spatial resolution. Phase-contrast MRA is increasingly used. However, further studies are required to verify its diagnostic potential. MRA technology continues to advance rapidly. Stronger gradient fields, shorter echo times and high resolution surface coils are developed. Contrast medium can be applied under standardized conditions with MR compatible power injectors. In phantom studies, the contrast-enhanced gradient echo sequences show reduced phase dispersion, resulting in an improved grading of stenoses. Initial patient studies underline these findings. Contrast-enhanced MR angiography has the potential to replace invasive arteriography in the evaluation of peripheral arterial vessels in the near future.
