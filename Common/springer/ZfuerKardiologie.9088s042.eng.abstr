 The rigid design of conventional endoscopic instruments with limited degrees of freedom has not allowed for endoscopic cardiac surgery. Using a surgical telemanipulation system that is operated from a master console, endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve repair can be performed with high precision. Closed chest cardiopulmonary bypass systems that allow cardioplegic cardiac arrest are required. After extensive experimental testing a telemanipulation system was als used clinically.
