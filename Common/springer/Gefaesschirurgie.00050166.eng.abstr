Abstract   There is little commercial medical software available for department management in the field of vascular surgery. The database VasoDat was created as an eventual study of vascular surgery 10 years ago. In the meantime it has been autonomously developed into an integral part of daily life in our department. With its relational structure it covers all routine procedures in the department with an intense working stability. Instruments have been developed for optimizing the department's organization and for supporting scientific works. Statistical functions have been added. Data exchange with other systems at the moment is restricted to the program "Quality management in carotid surgery" of the DGG (German Society of Vascular Surgery), and linking to the practising program PatiO and the accompanying private liquidation. Adding tools for image storing, visual report documentation, and linking with other computer systems is possible. Extensions for supporting the management of budgets and resources, e.g., in managing operative capacity, were developed in order to provide adequate time results and department controls.
