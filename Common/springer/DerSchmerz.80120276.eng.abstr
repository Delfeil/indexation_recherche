Background: Neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system. The pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain (SMP). Typical disorders with a SMP component are complex regional pain syndromes (reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia), traumatic neuralgias and herpes zoster.
