 Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a group of secretory as well as intracellular enzymes that release phopsholipides as an early step in inflammation and play a physiologic role in digestion. In humans, the group of secretory, low-molecular-weight PLA2 (sPLA2) is differentiated from the cytosolic, high-molecular-weight PLA2 (cPLA2). The two known cPLA2 mediate the intracellular response to inflammation by releasing arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Secretory pancreatic PLA2 (sPLA2-I) is a digestive zymogen secreted from pancreatic acinar cells in its inactive form. Activated by trypsin in the duodenum, it is an important digestive enzyme. In acute pancreatitis, circulating sPLA2-I indicates pancreatic injury but is mostly inactive. Synovial-type secretory PLA2 (sPLA2-II), first isolated from synovial fluid of arthritis patients, is increased in inflammation, after surgery or trauma, and in various inflammatory diseases. Unlike sPLA2-I, its catalytic activity is held responsible for mediating the systemic inflammatory reaction and its complications by regulating the synthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and platelet activating factor. Clinically, sPLA2-II offers new possibilities as an early marker for severe inflammation and predicting systemic complications in severely ill patients.
