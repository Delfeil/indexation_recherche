It is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability when treating shoulder instability. The traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions (Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs lesion, overstretching of the capsule), which are caused at the time of primary dislocation. The quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the Bankart lesion. The stronger the capsule, the greater the external force has to be in order to surmount the resistance caused by the capsule. The damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule. In cases of atraumatic instability, secondary lesions are normally absent. These instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule. When stabilizing, a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration: stability and function. Reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability. Additionally, the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted. Both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation.
