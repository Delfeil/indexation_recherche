  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. However, despite manifold publications reflecting numerous clinical trials about treatment of AF, the management of this arrhythmia is still under controversial discussion, in daily clinical work as well as in research. The present study concentrates on three major questions: 1. How frequent are recurrences of AF in long-term follow-up? Most of the previous studies used the occurrence of symptoms as a surrogate parameter for recurrences of AF, despite the expected high rate of asymptomatic relapses. In the present study a daily transtelephonic ECG transmission enables a rhythm monitoring independent of symptoms. 2. Is the frequency of AF recurrences significantly reduced by antiarrhythmic medication? A direct comparison of class I and III antiarrhythmic drugs, which still are most frequently used for this indication, and of placebo will answer this question. 3. How safe is the long-term treatment for the prevention of AF recurrences with special respect to proarrhythmic effects? The daily transtelephonic ECG transmission enables a quantitative and qualitative monitoring of tachy- and bradyarrhythmias independent of symptoms. Additionally, the daily analysis of ECG measures may detect parameters predicting subsequent life threatening arrhythmias.
