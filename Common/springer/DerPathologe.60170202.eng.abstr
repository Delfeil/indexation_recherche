The influence of oral contraceptives (OC) on histomorphological and molecular biological prognostic factors was studied in 471 breast cancer patients. Differences in histological tumor type, histological grade, tumor size, lymph node status, hormonal receptor status, PCNA expression and c-erbB-2 protein overexpression were investigated in relation to the duration of OC use ( < 5 years/ >= 5 years) and the time since last use. A total of 297 (63 %) patients had used oral contraceptives at some time in their life; 186 patients (39.5 %) had used OC's for 5 years or more. There were no significant differences in the tumor characteristics investigated with respect to OC use in general. Neither long-term use at some time in their life nor long-term use until breast cancer diagnosis had an effect on histomorphological and molecular biological factors. Thus, steroid hormones contained in OC's had no direct effect on prognostic factors in breast cancer.
