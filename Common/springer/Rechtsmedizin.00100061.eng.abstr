The composition of amalgam used as dental filling material has undergone many changes since it was first introducted by Adolf Witzel 100 years ago in Germany. Using the X-ray microanalysis EDAX allows a qualitative and quantitative determination of the metals in the alloy. The quantitative evaluation of the components makes it possible to classify the alloy into specific amalgam types. Changing definitions (such as specification No. 1 by the FDI) and quality regulations (such as the use of gamma-2-free amalgams) of new types of dental amalgams were made at various time periods and can therefore be used as an approximate time indicator. Such analyses are possible even with small volumes of material. Metallographic investigations support this analytical process and make the identification of the amalgam product possible. However, a more substantial amount of material is necessary for a metallographic investigation. These methods were tested on human remains and it can be concluded that they contribute to a delimination of the postmortem period.
