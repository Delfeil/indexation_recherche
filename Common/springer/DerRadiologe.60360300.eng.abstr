The Swedish Mammography-Screening trials have shown a long-term reduction in the mortality rate in women aged between 50-69 of up to 30 %. The lower reduction in mortality observed in women aged 40-49 was not statistically significant. Long-term observation over 20 years) has shown that a radiation dose of 2.4 mGy for a 2-view-mammography per breast does not lead to an increase in occurrence of breast cancers. The advantage of screening with regard to a reduction in death rate, frequent use of breast cancerving therapy and the reduction by half in the average size of the tumor compared to control groups results in: A recommendation for quality controlled screening in Germany from the age of 50 to 70. The possible advantage for younger women must be examined in further trials. Screening in the form of a de-centralized check-up system is to be carried out by practising doctors in co-operation with hospitals which will be responsible for double findings, assessment of difficult cases and continuous cost evaluation. Quality assuarance centres, reference and training centres are required. The mammography in curative check-ups will also benefit from a screening programme.
