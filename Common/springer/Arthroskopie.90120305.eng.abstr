In recent years ACL reconsruction with the midpatellar tendon has been being called into question more and more because of high morbidity at the harvest site and problems with fixation near the joint. The"wiper effect" or "bungee-effect" may be mentioned as an example. In this paper, ACL reconstruction using the hamstrings is presented, which, in contrast to fixation with the Endobutton, has a very high pull out strength and also tibial fixation near the joint with a biodegradable interference screw. This surgical method has been carefully developed and is technically sophisticated. The technique can be used mainly in younger women with small patellae, athletically inactive persons with a high level of instability, all patients with parapatellar problems or pain, and patients whose occupation involves kneeling. The short-term results are excellent; long-term results with this new method are not yet available. This method should be seen as an alternative to ACL reconstruction with the midpatellar tendon and, in our view, the security of fixation is at least as good as with the Endobutton.
