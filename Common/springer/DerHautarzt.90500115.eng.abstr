Perforating disorders represent a heterogenous group of dermatoses characterized by transepithelial elimination of dermal structures. Primary perforating disorders should be distinguished from secondary perforating disorders in which perforation with transepithelial elimination is a rare component of a variety of dermatoses. The primary perforating disorders are hyperkeratosis follicularis et parafollicularis in cutem penetrans (Kyrle's disease), elastosis perforans serpiginosa and perforating folliculitis. Acquired reactive perforating dermatosis (also known as acquired reactive perforating collagenosis) together with the hereditary variant of the reactive perforating collagenosis represent further examples of the primary perforating disorders. We report on 84 year old and 96 year old female patients with an acquired perforating dermatosis. Both of the patients additionally showed diabetes and hyperuricemia. Oral administration of allopurinol (100 mg daily) led to a healing of the disseminated skin lesions in 1-2 weeks. After a follow-up period of 6 months, both patients were in complete remission. On one hand, these results prove again the existence and the severity of this disease, and on the other hand suggest an immunomodulating or differentiation-promoting action in addition to the uricostatic effect of allopurinol.
