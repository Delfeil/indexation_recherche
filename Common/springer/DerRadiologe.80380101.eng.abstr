The laryngostroboscopy is regarded to be the most important functional investigation in laryngologic and phoniatric diagnostics. She allows an analysis of vocal fold vibrations during phonation. Stroboscopic evaluations permit to early detect infiltrative processes of the vocal folds. Superficial alterations of the mucous membrane that invade into the muscle cause a phonatory "standstill" of the vocal fold in the stroboscopy, i. e. a complete lack of vibratory motion. If such a phonatory standstill persists for more than 2 or 3 weeks, a biopsy via microlaryngoscopy is indicated for diagnostic purposes. In comparison to stroboscopy, imaging techniques are not of such great significance in early laryngeal cancer. But in case of suspected infiltration of the tumor a further diagnostic evaluation with CT or MRI is necessary to detect possible neoplastic invasion of the laryngeal cartilage or of extralaryngeal structures. In this paper, we present the principle of laryngostroboscopy, the examination procedure and the stroboscopic parameters. Case reports of early laryngeal cancer illustrate the interdisciplinary diagnostic procedure with CT, MRI and stroboscopy.
