In 33 patients with chronic venous incompetence (CVI) caused by primary varicoses or postthrombotic syndrome stage I-III (according to Widmer) the therapeutic benefit of 6 months of medically supervised physical exercise training was documented. During the training penud there was an improvement in subjective complains such as pain and tendency for edema in the legs. Mobility in the upper ankle joint was improved asuss as venous drainage function. Clinical benefit was achieved in the reduction of ulcer size; 7 of 10 ulcers completely healed. Medically supervised physical exercise training and optimized compression therapy are basic therapeutic approaches in conservative treatment in chronic venous insufficiency. Costs are covered by the patient's health insurance company in Germany, as long as the exercise training is medically supervised.
