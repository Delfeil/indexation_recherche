Red cells, platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma of a single donation contain leucocytes, causing a lot of side effects. Modern filtration- and apheresis-techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of <1x106 per unit. The best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised prestorage-filtration. This is an effective method, to prevent cytokine-mediated and leucocyte-mediated febrile nonhaemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), to prevent a primary immunisation to leucocyte- and histocompatibility-antigens, to avoid transmission of viral infections by blood transfusion, e.g. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and to exclude in special cases bacterial septicaemia. In addition, there are references to reduce the postoperative infections, the rate of recurrence of a tumor and the postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The use of leucocyte-depleted blood components for special indications is meanwhile established. Some European countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes. The authors recommend the general leucocyte-depletion of blood components considering the German medical law (AMG) and cost/benefit ratio.
