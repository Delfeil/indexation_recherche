Inhalational anaesthesia is the most common anaesthesia technique in paediatric anaesthesia worldwide. Up to now the standard anaesthetic used is halothane. Because halothane is tolerated in the upper airways without side effects it is well suited for the inhalational induction of anaesthesia. However, halothane exerts side effects on the hepatic and the cardiovascular system. This review focuses on the replacement of halothane by sevoflurane in paediatric anaesthesia. Apart from its favorable pharmacological properties sevoflurane is also superior because of economical considerations. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) Halothane and sevoflurane do not cause irritations of the airways and are thus suitable for an inhalational induction. Sevoflurane should be administered in oxygen/nitrous oxide during induction of anaesthesia to reduce excitation. (2) The MAC values of sevoflurane are age dependent. In contrast to adult patients the MAC values of sevoflurane are only decreased by 20 to 25% in paediatric patients. The end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane necessary for intubation or insertion of a laryngeal mask is 2 to 4 Vol.%. (3) The blood/gas partition coefficient of sevoflurane is low, resulting in shorter induction times with sevoflurane compared to halothane. The so called priming technique with 8 Vol.% of sevoflurane results in shorter induction times. Consequently, times to recovery and psycho-motor functions are favourable for sevoflurane compared to halothane in paediatric patients. However, shorter recovery times lead to earlier perception of postoperative pain, requiring adequate pain management. (4) The hemodynamic stability after administration of sevoflurane is favourable to that after halothane in paediatric patients, leading to significantly less bradycardia. (5) In paediatric patients no negative effects on kidney function have been observed after administration of sevoflurane. There is no scientific basis for organotoxic effects, thus sevoflurane is suitable for low-flow and minimal-flow anaesthesia. (6) The duration of the action of muscle relaxants is increased to a greater extent in presence of sevoflurane compared to halothane. Consequently, the total dose of muscle relaxants can be reduced using sevoflurane. (7) Similar to the established inhalational anaesthetics sevoflurane triggers malignant hyperthermia (MH) and must not be used in patients in which MH is suspected or in which a predisposition for MH is known.
