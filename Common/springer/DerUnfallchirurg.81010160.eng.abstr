Quality control in preclinical medical care has become a matter of concern in recent years. In order to evaluate the quality of treatment one has to set standards. Most of the current standards were defined by different preclinical care organisations and are also accepted in the unique emergency medical care protocol used in the Federal Republic of Germany. Considering these standards, we retrospectively analyzed the preclinical treatment of all multiple trauma patients admitted to our department between 1985 and 1996. The major issues of this analysis were the diagnoses, the indications for invasive measures and the performance.
