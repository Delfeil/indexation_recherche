The development of modern endonasal sinus surgery is fundamentally based on the introduction of optical instrumentation. Endoscopes and microscopes are commonly used in such surgery. We tested a new combination of a stereoscopic single-channel endoscope with an operating microscope (ENDO-OPMI) for endonasal sinus surgery. This combination of the endoscope and microscope are connected in a way that results in a self-carried stereo-endoscope. To date, the ENDO-OPMI has been evaluated in cadaver studies and 7 cases of endonasal sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis. The trial was used to evaluate the clinical use of the current system and its possibilities for future developments.
