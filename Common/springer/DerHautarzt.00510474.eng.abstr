Background and Objecitve. Actinic prurigo (AP) is a hereditary photodermatosis with typical symptoms and is quite common in North- and South-America. The key genetic factor appears to be a Native American background. In Europeans this type of AP is extremely rare; some dispute if this disease exists in Caucasians. Some newer publications postulate that these patients share HLA markers with the Native Americans. The most important differential diagnosis for AP is polymorphic light eruption which can be excluded relatively accurately by the clinical picture, typical histology and HLA pattern.
