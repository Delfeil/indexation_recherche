A 51/2 year-old girl with an optic glioma had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation because of hydrocephalus internus at the age of 5 years: seven months after this operation she developed an ascites. Elevated protein levels could be detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and ascites fluid. Results of CSF protein electrophoresis suggested a disturbed blood-CSF barrier as the possible cause of the elevated protein level. The ascites most likely was a consequence of a poor peritoneal absorption of the protein-rich CSF and resolved completely after converting the shunt to a ventriculoatrial system.
