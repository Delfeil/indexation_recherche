Cisatracurium (51W89) is one of the ten  stereoisomers of atracurium, accounting for about 15% of the racemate. The ED95 of cisatracurium was determined to be about  50 µg/kg (cation, molecular weight 929), while the ED95 of atracurium (besylate salt, molecular weight 1245) was 250 µg/kg. Thus, on a molar basis in adult patients, cisatracurium is about 3.5 times as potent as the racemic atracurium mixture. We compared atracurium with cisatracurium in healthy adult patients and found an almost identical pharmacodynamic profile. In children, an ED95 of about 40 µg/kg was determined, while a 1-min-longer onset of cisatracurium was found in geriatric than in young adult patients. The presence of chronic renal failure did not prolong the duration of action of cisatracurium. The recovery of neuromuscular transmission from a cisatracurium infusion of up to 145 h was investigated in intensive care unit patients. Their time from the end of infusion to a train-of-four ratio >0.7 (68 +/- 18 min) was on average only some 70% longer than after an infusion of cisatracurium for 2 h in normal surgical patients. In another study, no signs of histamine release nor any clinically relevant cardiovascular effects of cisatracurium were found in doses up to eight times ED95.
