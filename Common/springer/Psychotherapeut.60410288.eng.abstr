In this essay Kernberg discusses prevalent categorical and dimensional classification systems of mental disorders in view of the fact that these are unsatisfactory from a clinical point of view. Regarding the all too strong identification of surface behaviour and psychological structure as one of the major problems in these classifications, he first presents briefly his theory of relationships of (constitutionally determined) affects as components of drives (temperament) and discusses connections between temperament and character in normal personality. Without claiming to present a fully satisfactory psychoanalytic classification of personality disorders, he proposes a classification which integrates accepted diagnoses in a psychoanalytic framework. It is a developmentally based hierarchical model, involving reflections of object-relations theory, the theory of instincts and structural theory, as well as the theory of self. The common classification into neuroses, personality disorders, borderline disorders and psychoses is substituted by a comprehensive use of "personality disorders" resp. "personality organisations" as supraordinate categories. The hierarchy is conceived along the dimension of severity with "borderline personality organisation" and "neurotic personality organisation" as supraordinate concepts.
