The correction of complex long bone deformities with concurrent bending, twisting and shortening is primarily based on complex preoperative planning. Up to now, wedge-shaped cortico-spongiose osteotomy has usually been performed. The single cut osteotomy requires more complex mathematical calculations and was therefore less frequently undertaken. In this paper, we present a graphical approach to define the plane of the single-cut osteotomy without any calculations. The resulting osteotomy allows a simultaneous correction of a deformation in the coronal and sagittal planes, as well as a coexisting torsional error. The advantages of this graphical approach are evident. Preoperative planning is significantly simplified and abbreviated as mathematical calculations are no longer needed. Furthermore, the precision by which the osteotomy plane is defined is not decreased by application of this method. However, the osteotomy should be done preoperatively in a model.
