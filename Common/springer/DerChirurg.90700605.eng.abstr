 A 36-year-old female patient was transferred to our unit for surgical treatment of a biliary tract obstruction. ERC disclosed an obliteration of the common hepatic duct involving the hepatic bifurcation. Primary sclerotic cholangitis and carcinoma of the bile duct could not be confirmed histologically in the biopsy specimens. Tumor markers and autoimmune antibodies were normal. Histological examination of the ductus choledochus during the operation was not conclusive and a malignant lymphoma was considered. The macroscopic appearance comprised obliterative alterations extending to the right hepatic duct. Therefore, resection of the extrahepatic bile duct, right hemihepatectomy and hepaticojejunostomy were performed. The final histological statement revealed a lymphoepithelial carcinoma. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful, and the patient is in good condition without any signs of recurrent disease 12 months after the operation. This tumor has been described as occurring as a neoplasm of the stomach and salivary glands exclusively and as being of low-grade malignancy. Additional histological evaluations confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoepithelial carcinoma.
