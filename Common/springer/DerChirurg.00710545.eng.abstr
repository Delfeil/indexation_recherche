Abstract.  In recent years, two methods of intraoperative monitoring of the laryngeal nerve have mostly been used: evoked electromyographic responses via endscopically applied needle electrodes inserted into the adducting laryngeal muscles, and non-invasive electrodes like special tubes with integrated electrodes or separately insertable electrodes like the postcricoid electrode or disposable electrodes attached to the tube, as used in this study. The incidence of recurrent nerve paresis or paralysis during the IRM period was 1/174 nerves (0.6 %). The advantage of the IRM is the quick and certain identification of the nerve; intraoperative monitoring cannot replace a proper surgical technique. We conclude that the IRM, using a laryngeal surface electrode attached to the tube, is a safe and reliable method.
