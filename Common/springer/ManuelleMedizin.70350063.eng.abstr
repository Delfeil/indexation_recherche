This report describes a distinctive pattern of findings in peripheral sensory-nociceptive afferent nerves after spinal injury. Subsequent to trauma there was segmental, multisegmental or hemilateral hypoaesthesia with refractory, intenseful painful symptoms. None of the classical neurological causes for such hypoaesthesia were present. "Normal" therapy resulted in more severe symptoms. Depending on the distribution of the hypo- or anaesthesia, there were also efferent symptoms (coordination problems, impairments of proprioception, etc.). Colleagues who have made similar observations or are familiar with these symptoms are cordially invited to assist with the interpretation of this clinical picture.
