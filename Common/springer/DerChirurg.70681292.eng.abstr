 Jaundice in critically ill patients may be difficult to explain. This study analyzes pathophysiologically relevant data, and discusses the prognostic value of hyperbilirubinemia. A total of 1275 patients were prospectively enrolled; 7.6 % developed hyperbilirubinemia of at least 2 mg/dl. Mortality in icteric patients was significantly higher (29 %) than in the non-icteric group. Sepsis, shock and the number of blood transfusions are very important in hyperbilirubinemia. Nevertheless, in critically ill patients, jaundice per se is not a sign of poor outcome; indeed it only reflects the underlying disease.
