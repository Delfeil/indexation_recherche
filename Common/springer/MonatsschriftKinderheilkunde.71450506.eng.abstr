We report on three cases with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes. All three patients suffered from autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II. Among our patients with isolated IDDM (about 250 patients) no case of ITP was seen. Therefore we recommend that all patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored for other diseases associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type II.
