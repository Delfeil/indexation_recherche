  In accordance with the German law on care for helpless persons, an observer rating scale has been developed to allow a staging of need of care. Construction of the scale, item descriptions, definitions, algorithms for sum score and inter-rater reliability data are reported. The scale can reliably measure the need of care, quality of care, and who is the care provider.
