 The oral ingestion of 50 - 300 ml Lysoformin 3000, a glutaral, glyoxal, and didecyl-dimethyl-ammoniumchloride containing disinfectant, caused severe coagulative necrosis in the upper gastrointestinal and whole respiratory tract in a 31 year old female. In the course of 86 days the injuries in the esophagus and stomach decreased almost entirely, while still ventilation and perfusion disorders in the respiratory system persisted. The mucosal injuries should lead to the change in the valuation of Lysoformin 3000 as corrosive to mucosal and dermal membranes.
