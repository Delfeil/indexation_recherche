 Primary systemic vasculitities play an important role in the differential diagnosis of systemic diseases. They can be classified according to newly developed classification criteria. In the past, systemic vasculitities were more diagnosed in the general phase of the disease. In the meantime limited forms can be diagnosed more easily. Prior to immunosuppressive therapy, a standardized staging-procedure is essential to define the extent of the disease. Therefore a program was established using methods that are easy to apply in all patients. In this setting the usefulness of this approach was investigated. Apart from the laboratory tests including antibody testing, the chest x-ray, consultation of the ENT specialist, ultrasound of the abdomen, and ECG were also very useful. The eye and neurological investigations, and the MRI of the head were of minor significance, but also important.
