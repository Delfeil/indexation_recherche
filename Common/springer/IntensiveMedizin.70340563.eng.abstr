 Thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has proved to be an established method; but intra- and postoperatively, there is a high risk of bleeding complications. A 50-year old female with familiar hypophosphatasia and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture. Intraoperatively, petCO2 suddenly dropped, paCO2 rose, and circulatory arrest occurred. CPR was started immediately with closed-chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines. While continuing CPR, surgery was stopped, the wound was sealed provisionally, and the patient was transferred to the ICU. Because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in a total dosage of 100 mg was begun. 2.25 hours after the onset of circultory arrest, and 1.5 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis, the patient's hemodynamic patterns under high-dosage catecholamines were satisfactory. The bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions. The situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver, spleen and small intestines, which required surgical intervention, and acute renal failure, which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration. Twenty-eight days after receiving CPR, the patient was discharged from the ICU. A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs, capnometry, blood gas analysis, and electrocardiography. Due to the requirements of the emergency situation (ongoing CPR), further diagnostic tools were not used. The patient survived without any neurological deficiency, despite the extended 135-min use of CPR, and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma, and to performing CPR in the presence of fibrinolytica.
