Thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA) faces growing interest as an adjuvant anaesthetic and postoperative analgesic regimen. The procedure allows a specific blockade of nociceptive reflex arches and may exert beneficial effects on stress-induced alterations of organ function. Myocardial blood flow to areas at risk is improved, and paradoxical reactions of atherosclerotic coronary arteries after sympathetic stimulation are suppressed. After cardiac surgery, TEA improved postoperative recovery and resulted in better haemodynamic stability and allowed earlier extubation. During vascular surgery, the graft occlusion rate was significantly decreased. The improved pulmonary function after TEA is due to superior pain relief which allows the patients to breathe and cough sufficiently. After upper abdominal surgery, TEA leads to improved recovery of gastrointestinal function which reduces the risk of bacterial translocation. Although lumbar epidural anaesthesia is preferred by many anaesthesiologists as there is no risk of traumatizing the spinal cord, many positive effects are forgone. With insufficient rostral spread of a lumbar epidural block above the fifth thoracic level, cardiac complications can occur due to reflex activation of sympathetic outflow in unblocked thoracic regions. When the contraindications are carefully observed, TEA can be safely performed in most patients.
