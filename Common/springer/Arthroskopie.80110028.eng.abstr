Because of better clinical examination, MRI and arthroscopy, more ligamentous tears of the anterior cruciate ligament are being detected at an earlier stage. Conservatively treated secondary meniscal lesions develop very rapidly. In operative treatment there is the concern that damage to the growth plates may occur because of drilling the bone tunnels, with subsequent leg length differences and axial deviations.
