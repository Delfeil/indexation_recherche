Despite the diagnostic criteria of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, the term borderline has been used in a non-specific way for a long time. For our investigation we constructed a questionnaire, which contained the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder (BPD), plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder. The two additional criteria for the BPD used by the DSM-IV were added. 800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria, which they thought were typical for the BPD. By using the operational diagnostic approach for ICD-10 and DSM-IV a disorder was diagnosed from each of the 162 received questionnaires based on the marked criteria. 92,0% of the questionnaires contained marked criteria for the diagnosis of the BPD by ICD-10 and 96,3% by DSM-IV. In addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis. This is a sign for the difficulty to separate the BPD from other personalitiy disorders or the schizotype  disorder by using operationalised criteria. Looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality  disorders, e.g. for the BPD which has been discussed by many authors for years, modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered.
