Within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill, we examined 83 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program. The course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3-year period by means of annual follow-up examinations. The sample comprised 44 men and 39 women with an average age of 35 years (SD +/- 8,5). The majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization. After 3 years, 22% of the patients were integrated into the general labor market, 26% had sheltered employment, 23% were still in work therapy, and 29% were unemployed. Besides the patients' subjective expectations, early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration. Outpatient work therapy is a contemporary, effective organizational form of sociotherapy. It may contribute to improved vocational competence and integration, reduced psychiatric hospitalization and stabilized psychopathology.
