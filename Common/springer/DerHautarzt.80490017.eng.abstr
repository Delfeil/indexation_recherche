We describe an immunochemotherapy for metastatic melanoma that combines epifocal applications of the contact sensitizer DNCB over cutaneous metastases with systemic DTIC treatment. 4 complete remissions and 3 partial remissions were achieved in  15 patients. 6 of these remissions were seen in the 7 previously untreated patients. The advantages of this therapy which is in particular interesting for dermatologists are  tolerable side effects and low costs. This  publication is designed to stimulate larger randomized trials in order to answer open questions.
