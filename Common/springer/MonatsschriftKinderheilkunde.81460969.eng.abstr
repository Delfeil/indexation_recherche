A 23 month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia, mainly truncal rash and unclear pain. Previously he had shown fever, conjunctivitis and desquamations of hands and feet. Laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and an elevation of ESR and gamma-globulins. No bacterial infection was found. The ECG showed signs of a myocardial ischemia. The sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery. The boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest. The autopsy verified the diagnosis of Kawasaki-syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis.
