Abstract.  An accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by Matthias Grünewald in his painting "The Temptation of St. Anthony", which is part of the Isenheim altar piece (1512 - 1516), which is now exhibited in Colmar, Alsace. In contrast, Sutton in 1916 only described a "leucoderma acquisitum centrifugum", leaving the nature of the central lesion in the dark. The term Sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative eponymic designation "Grünewald naevus".
