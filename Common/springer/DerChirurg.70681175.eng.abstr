This prospective study served as a quality control of a revision concept for case of post-traumatic infection following open reduction and internal fixation in fracture treatment. It is based on clinical and microbiological criteria and has two aims: (1) eradication of the infection and avoidance of development of chronic osteitis; (2) maintenance of internal fixation, if possible. Thirty-four patients were recruited in this study. Surgical revisions were performed according to a consistant concept (débridement, irrigation, local chemotherapy, drainage) in defined time intervals (2 days). The operation site had to be bacteriologically clean after four revisions. Otherwise, the implant had to be removed. Both aims were reached in 11 cases: management of infection with maintenance of internal fixation. In 23 cases the implant material had to be removed. Nevertheless the infection was eliminated in all these patients without exception. The following risk factors for mandatory implant removal were evaluated: diabetes, arteriosclerosis, alcoholism, nicotine. This revision concept helps in the management of acute postoperative osteitis following ORIF in fracture treatment and in avoiding the development of chronic osteitis.
