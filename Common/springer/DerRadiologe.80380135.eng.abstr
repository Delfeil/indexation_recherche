Retained surgical towels (gossypiboma) present a diagnsotic problem if they remain asymptomatic for many years. We report on one 51 year old patient with repeated septic temperatures in the early post-operative phase after hemicolectomy. The contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed a well-defined round soft-tissue mass with a dense, enhanced wall containing an internal high-density wavy and striped area. At laparotomy a secondary infected surgical sponge with abscess formation was found.
