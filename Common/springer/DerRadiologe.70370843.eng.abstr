This review focuses on the pathophysiological changes in acute cerebral ischemia, with special emphasis on disturbances of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the associated penumbra concept. Alternatively, the model of peri-infarct depolarization is demonstrated. Metabolic and molecular changes caused by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion are discussed, namely energy failure, release of glutamate with an excitatoric burst, calcium influx in neurons, generation of free radicals, activation of different proteases, disturbances of protein synthesis, induction of gene expression and apoptosis, loss of membrane integrity, edema formation and microvascular disturbances. In summary, the pathophysiological changes after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion are most adequately described by a network of interacting different mechanisms of tissue alterations. The simple concept of a cascade of ischemic effects which would be easy to block seems to be less applicable. A time window of approximately 6 h for the acute stroke therapy is postulated on the base of the above mentioned pathophysiological changes. The recently introduced treatment regimen with optimized basic treatment, recanalization using thrombolysis and neuroprotection by different agents is presented. Different modes of a possible intervention are discussed. Modern concepts of stroke therapy including stroke-unit care and thrombolysis with add-on neuroprotection seem to have potential for improving the outcome of acute stroke patients.
