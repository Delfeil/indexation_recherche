 Concerning the problem of violation of sexual abstinence in analysis the essay shows the dilemma between the call for the judge and the necessity of supervision and analysis of the analyst. The author sees one of the roots of the problem in the absence of a practicable psychoanalytic concept how to handle the erotic feelings in analysis appropriately so as to further development. Extending the idea of a "transitional space" Winnicott's the conception of an "erotic-sexual full scope" is developed that makes a form of abstinence possible, which cancels the contradiction between substitutive satisfaction and renunciation sexual gratification. Following this conception the connection between the neurotic treatment of sexuality in our society and violations of abstinence in analysis rooted in the disturbed relationship to ourselves as our body is shown. Further, the significance of the interdependence between the interest of society in a protected space of development and the elementary interest of psychoanalysis in the possibility and the existential conditions of this space is emphasized, for it is identical with the existential basis of psychoanalysis in society.
