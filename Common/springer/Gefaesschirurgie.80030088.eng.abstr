 In contrast to carotid endarterectomy, the indication for vertebral surgery is not standardized. In a prospective study including 44 patients, it was investigated whether extended diagnostics help in making the decision as to whether operative treatment should be given. The diagnostic procedures included DSA, CCT, MRI, 24 h ECG, otoneurological, and neurological examination, and ultrasonic flow measurement. We compared the diagnostic results before and after surgery with the subjective symptoms of the patients. Two different surgical procedures were used: transposition of the vertebral artery to the CCA or graft implantation between CCA and atlas loop. In the follow up period (6 - 9 months), 72% of the patients had improved or were without complaints. The validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement. In our opinion, exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery.
