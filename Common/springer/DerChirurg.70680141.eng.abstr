 Surgery for symptomatic hyperparathyroidism remains the standard therapy. Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidsm (pHPT) is being diagnosed with increasing frequency owing to broad serum testing. Indications for surgery in this setting are controversial. For evaluation of surgical safety we performed a retrospective analysis of our patients who were being operated on for asymptomatic pHPT. From January 1988 until August 1995, 243 patients were treated for pHPT and registered prospectively at our unit. Seventy-six patients were classified as asymptomatic. In all, 75 % of the patients were female; the mean age was 62 years. In this group, 87 % of the patients had cervical sonography in order to localize the adenoma. Highly selective venous catheterization was required in cervical reexplorations. Statistical analysis for potential prognostic factors for the clinical outcome was performed. Successful cervical exploration was possible in 71 patients (94.7 %). With 4 patients remaining hypercalcemic, the rate of persistency was 5.2 %. Localization procedures were correct in 58 % for cervical ultrasound and 77 % for selective venous catheterization. Postoperative morbidity included one permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and 2 patients with hemorrhage who were treated by reoperation. While one case of permanent hypoparathyroidism was well controlled by oral supplementation, 18 patients recovered from temporary hypoparathyroidism. No postoperative mortality occurred. Risk factor analysis revealed only cervical reexplorations for HPT to be associated with a higher morbidity (P = 0.02). Surgery for asymptomatic pHPT can be performed with reasonable safety. Cervical reexplorations in asymptomatic patients should be reserved for special indications. Apart from this small group, all patients should be evaluated for surgery.
