X-ray images were taken of 22 patients suffering from different orthopaedic disease patterns using magnification with focus diameters between 0.012 and 0.100 mm. This yielded improved resolution of detailed structures, especially in tumours and aseptic bone necroses. Owing to the relatively low efficiency of the X-ray tube (affected by the condition of the X-ray equipment), however, exposure times of several seconds were required, and the voltage had to be higher than in a conventional X-ray procedure. This resulted in a lack of sharpness owing to movement and a loss of contrast. Hence, the clinical use of focus diameters below 0.1 mm does not seem to be meaningful.
