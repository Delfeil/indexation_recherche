Problem: "Pain under Discussion" aims at the education of patients with chronic headache and back pain by applying a standardized manual with detailed instructions for seven sessions in a group setting. Apart from encouraging a reconceptualization of the patients' pain experience with reference to a bio-psycho-social model, the program provides information about the vicious circle of pain, avoidance and demoralization and relies heavily on behavioral assumptions about the process of chronicity. Patients are offered participation in progressive relaxation according to Jacobson, they learn to engage in pleasant activities, and are instructed to more and more maintain an upright body position during various activities of every day life. The study evaluates the outcome of the training. Moreover, as an algorithm for grading pain patients according to their level of chronicity has recently been developed by Gerbershagen, we use this algorithm in order to investigate the relationship between the outcome of treatment and the assigned level of chronicity. In addition, we test the assumption that a higher level of chronicity is related to a lower level of psychological functioning pre treatment.
