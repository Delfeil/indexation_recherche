Since the first child was born after in-vitro fertilization in 1978, different techniques of ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval and embryo culture have improved significantly. The development of microinjection techniques was a mile stone in reproductive medicine. Even in cases of severe impairment of semen quality, using the Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), pregnancy rates of approximately 20 % per treatment cycle can be achieved. However for using artificial reproductive techniques (ART) the female age is a major limiting factor as well as the development of premature ovarian failure (POF). Crucial for the male is the question whether or not sperm cells can be retrieved. Today an interdisciplinary approach is recommended to take care of the afflicted couple in order to address the complex problem of infertility. There is evidence that children born after microinjection techniques bare a higher risk for chromosomal aberrations compared to the normal population. However rates of major malformations seem to be identical in both groups. An evaluation of the potential risks and efforts and an extensive counseling of the infertile couple has to be taken before initiating invasive ART.
