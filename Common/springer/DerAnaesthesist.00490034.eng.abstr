Although autoantibodies against factor VIII or factor IX are a rare phenomenon, they are associated with a high risk of bleeding and high mortality. The condition, termed ac- quired haemophilia, occurs equally in both sexes and is most frequent in higher age groups. Patients typically present with severe bleedings in muscles and skin. In contrast to patients with congenital haemophilia and inhibitors, joint bleedings are very rare. In approximately half of all cases an associated disease state can be identified as the cause of autoantibody formation. An immediate and comprehensive diagnosis is essential for a rapid initiation of therapy. Equally important are a careful diagnostic differentiation between congenital and acquired factor deficiencies and the exclusion of non-specific inhibitors, which increase the occurrence of thrombolic events. The inhibitor titre, quantified using the Bethesda assay, is an important criterion for selecting the appropriate therapy. A wide range of treatment options is now available for the management of bleedings in patients with acquired haemophilia, namely porcine factor VIII, recombinant factor VIIa, prothrombin complex concentrates, and immunoadsorptions. In addition, immunosuppressive therapies are used to achieve permanent reduction or elimination of inhibitors.
