Gynecomastia is an enlargement of the male breast. We studied a group of 115 men attending a dermatological clinic to evaluate the frequency of possible risk factors and hormonal findings. Gynecomastia was diagnosed, if a horizontal skinfold exceeded 2-3 cm, and if the diameter of the areola wa greater than 3 cm. In 32 patients (27,8%) the criteria for gynecomastia were fulfilled. The frequency increased significantly with the body mass index. 18 different medications were identified, but only two were take by more than two patients (allopurinol, coronary dilators). None of the 15 underlying diseases was associated with a significant increase or decrease in the risk of gynecomastia. Serum cortisol was the only endocrine study which was associated with an increased incidence of gynecomastia. As gynecomastia appears frequently as a phenomenon unrelated to other diseases or medications, it may be a condition per se.
