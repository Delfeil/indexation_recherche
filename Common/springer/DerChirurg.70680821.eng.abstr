 We present a case of primary plasmocytoma of the left upper bronchus. Occlusion led to atelectasis of the left upper lobe and subsequent poststenotic pneumonia. Therapy consisted of local excision of the bronchus and postoperative radiotherapy. This type of lung-conserving therapy in a case of primary plasmocytoma has not been described before.
