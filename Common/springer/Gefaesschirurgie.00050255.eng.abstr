 "Chronic venous insufficiency" is the name for a pathologic condition in which the blood can no longer be pumped from the veins in the legs in adequate quantities when the normal conditions of daily living apply. The reflux progresses from the principal veins back through the smallest venules into the region of the microcirculation and ultimately takes its toll on the tissue metabolism. Typical clinical characteristics that can be confirmed with the aid of a simple objective measuring process are the most suitable basis for staging principles.
