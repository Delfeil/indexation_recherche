 Accidental injury of important anatomic structures is a factor frequently mentioned in the discussion of the sense of laparoscopic hernia repair via the transabdominal or extraperitoneal approach. We describe the topographic anatomy of the inguinal region and point out important structures in this area as found in our anatomic preparations of eight specimens at the Department of Anatomy of the University of Ulm. These observations are correlated with a meta-analysis of published data on complications of this new technique for inguinal hernia repair. It is concluded that complications of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair can be avoided if the topographic anatomy of the inguinal region is sufficiently taken into consideration.
