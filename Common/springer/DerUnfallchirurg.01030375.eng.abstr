The fixation of hamstring grafts in ACL reconstruction requires a connector device. During the process of ingrowing the graft stability depends entirely on the fixation. The following study focused on the mechanical conditions of no 6 Ethibond, 5 mm Mersilene tape and 5 mm Polylene tape. The material were tested as loops with a length of 30 mm including the knot similar to intraoperative conditions. The ultimate tension load and elongation of the conditioned and unconditioned loops were investigated under cyclic load of 50 N and 100 N using a tension load machine. The ultimate tension load increased significantly only for Mersilene from 416 N to 462 N. However, the highest ultimate tension load showed Polylene with 479 N. The oscillating load up to 100 N revealed for unconditioned loops and elongation of 4.1 mm for Ethibond, 2.9 mm for Polylene and 5.4 mm for Mersilene. The elongation decreased significantly for the conditioned loops to a maximum of 1.4 mm. Concerning the amplitude during the period of oscillating load there was found a significant reduction as well. Based on our results Polylene showed the best mechanical properties. Regardless the intraoperatively used material we advocate the conditioning of the loops before anchoring the hamstring graft in ACL reconstruction.
