In a report reflecting my personal experiences the work of the East-West-Committee of the DPV (German Psychoanalytic Association) is presented. The exchange of clinical experiences during the last ten years is considered retrospectively, and it is recognizable, that those members of the relatively small group of East-West-colleagues who participated regularly at this dialogue differ less and less in their way of working. The approaches to psychoanalysis had often a personal slant and were related to the development of friendships. In contrast, the parallel approach on an institutional level - concerning much more colleagues - seems to be far more ponderous.
