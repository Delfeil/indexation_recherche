According to a literature search, it seems most unlikely based on pathophysiological requirements and physiological aspects that traumatized children benefit from preoperative waiting times aimed at achieving a 6-h fast. Irrespective of fasting, traumatized children are at risk of requiring aspiration. Many generally recommended measures for the avoidance of aspiration are neither reasonable nor effective in traumatized children. The physical and psychological benefits that can be derived from shorter preoperative waiting times can more than override the organizational difficulties caused by waiting longer.
