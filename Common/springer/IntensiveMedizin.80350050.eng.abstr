 Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nerve system. Clinical hallmarks are symmetric muscle paralysis, areflexia and pronouced autonomic disturbances. Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for intensive care support in patients with GBS. The present report of a 33 year old man with Miller-Fisher syndrome, a variant of the GBS, discusses the management of patients with GBS in the intensive care unit.
