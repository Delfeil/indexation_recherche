Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is a severe disease of unknown etiology. Accumulating evidence suggests that agonist-like autoantibodies against the 1 adrenoceptor in the circulation of dilated cardiomyopathy may play an important role. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the selective 1-adrenoceptor blocker, bisoprolol, on 1-adrenoceptor peptide induced autoimmune myocardial damage.
