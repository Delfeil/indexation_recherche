Objectives: Continuous epidural analgesia (EA) and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) are widely used for postoperative pain control. Studies indicate that both analgesic regimens provide good analgesia after major surgery. However, because of the following reasons it is still unclear whether one of the two modes of application is superior. First, there are conflicting data regarding the differences in pain relief and drug use between epidural and intravenous administration of opioids. Second, in many studies epidural analgesia is performed by a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids. Third, reduced morbidity was observed only in some of the studies, in which epidural analgesia provided better pain relief than systemic opioid supply. Despite these conflicting results, EA with local anaesthetics and fentanyl as well as PCA with piritramid, a highly potent µ-agonist, are routinely used in Germany. The purpose of this study was to compare these two treatments for analgesic efficacy, pulmonary function, incidence of side effects and complications in patients undergoing thoracotomy.
