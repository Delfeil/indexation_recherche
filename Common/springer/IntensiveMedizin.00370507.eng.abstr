 The hemodynamic treatment of septic shock consists of fluid repletion, maintenance of an adequate cardiac output, and restoration of mean arterial pressure. Norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor that can be considered when the patient is adequately fluid resuscitated, when cardiac output is greater than 3.5 l/min/m2 (or Sv O2>=65%) and when blood pressure remains low. The objective is to achieve and maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60-70 mmHg, or more in some patients (older or hypertensive patients). Renal effects of norepinephrine were evaluated in several studies; urine output, creatinine clearance, and osmolar clearance are significantly increased. Norepinephrine is perfectly suited in situations of high renal output and low renal resistance, as is the case in septic shock patients. The effect on oxygen transport is unpredictable. The effects on lactate concentrations were poorly evaluated, but several studies suggest that the drug does not worsen and can even improve tissue oxygenation of septic shock patients. Provided that cardiac output is maintained, treatment with norepinephrine is without negative effects on splanchnic tissue oxygenation. In conclusion, the clinical experience with norepinephrine strongly suggests that this drug can successfully increase blood pressure without deteriorating cardiac output and organ function. Whether using norepinephrine in septic shock patients effects mortality as compared to dopamine or epinephrine still requires a prospective study.
