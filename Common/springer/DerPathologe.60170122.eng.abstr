Gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type (according to Ming) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only. Over the past 18 years, we have observed 23 cases of this tumour type, accounting for 3.6 % of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas. Macroscopically they were classified as Borrmann IV or III, while histologically most of them were well differentiated. Histologically, these tumours retained the pre-existing structures of the stomach, most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic, particularly in the submucosal and subserosal layers. In all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels. All but 2 cases with metastatically involved lymph nodes, often small, showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus; in three quarters of cases the serosa was infiltrated by the tumour. Significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom Billroth II operation had been performed. The mean survival time of 16 patients was 14.9 months. Owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth, extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of signet ring cell cancer. The high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging. Preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult, because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification. Close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary, and intraoperative assessment of the tumour - including frozen section of necessary - in particular is of the outmost importance.
