The purpose of this study was to evaluate low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist. Between August 1995 and May 1997, 75 patients at the Unfallchirurgische Universitätsklinik, Mainz, Germany, with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination, X-ray and MRI imaging. MRI analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying MRI experience without knowledge of the patient's history. The sensitivity and specifity of the more [U1] and the less experienced [U2] radiologist ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 61 to 100% (U2). Positive and negative predictive value ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 58 to 100% (U2); accuracy ranged from 92 to 100% (U1) and from 77 to 100% (U1). We conclude that the results of low-field MRI are comparable with those of high-field MRI and that differences in the results of the experienced and less experienced radiologist can be established.
