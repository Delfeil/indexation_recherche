We report on two patients with postmenopausal frontal fibrosing alopecia. This recently described disease affects postmenopausal women and is characterized by progressive recession of the frontotemporal and parietal hair margins. It leads to a symmetrical band-like scarring area of alopecia 3-6 cm wide. Histological examination shows perifollicular fibrosis and lymphocytic inflammation concentrated around the isthmus and infundibular areas of the follicles. One of our two patients also had vulvar lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. An effective treatment for this type of postmenopausal alopecia is yet not known, but the course of the disease seems to be self-limited.
