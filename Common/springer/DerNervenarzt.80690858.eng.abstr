Seventy-nine patients with chronic neuromuscular diseases were examined by psychodiagnostic tests. The most frequently used coping strategies were "compliance and confidence in the physician", "self encouragement", "to relative by comparison" and "problem-solving". Comparison of the test  sample and our total sampling group and the groups divided by diagnosis showed more common features than differences in the coping process. This might be caused by similar general problems in chronic diseases. Less "compliance and confidence in the physician" was the only significant difference between the myasthenic patients and the remaining test group. We supposed less treatment possibilities and/or longer duration of illness (remaining test group) to be responsible for this result. Duration of illness in common seems to have an influence on coping. Patients suffering a longer illness showed reduced values in "self encouragement". Common and specific problems and circumstances of illness seem to be more significant for the coping process than the diagnosis. The patients' mood, which we took as a measure for partial aspects of adaptivity of coping, correlated significantly with the strength of the complaints felt. Classification into adaptive and maladaptive coping forms is not possible.
