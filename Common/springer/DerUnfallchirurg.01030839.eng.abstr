Using a mechanical testing procedure, various fixator constructs were tested in vitro. In addition, the influence of the passive soft tissue structures on the fixation stiffness was determined. An increased number of Schanz' screws or Kirschner wires led to a comparable increase in stiffness than that observed with an increasing screw or wire diameter. In consequence, larger diameters should be preferred over an additional screw or wire where clinically applicable. With diaphyseal telescoping rods only the axial stiffness decreased. As expected, large ring diameters as well as titanium wires reduced stiffness components. Bracing the outer rings caused a reduction of the overall stiffness. Asymmetric pre-tensioning of the K-wires resulted in a significant reduction of tension in the neighboring wire.
