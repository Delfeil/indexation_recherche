Background: Electron beam CT (EBCT) can acquire rapid, multiple thin-section tomograms of the beating heart in synchrony with the electrocardiogram and quantify coronary calcification without intravenous contrast. Coronary calcification is an active process exclusively associated with atherosclerotic plaque formation and regulated in a manner similar to the calcification of bone. Clinical studies have demonstrated that EBCT coronary calcification (1) follows a pattern similar to the epidemiology of coronary artery disease (CAD), (2) has a high sensitivity (90-95 %) for coronary plaque and significant angiographic coronary stenoses, and (3) has the potential to assess the prognosis of patients with coronary atherosclerotic disease. Coronary calcium area or "score" correlates best with overall plaque burden within the coronary system. However, coronary calcium is of limited value in distinguishing coronary stenosis on a segment-by-segment basis.
