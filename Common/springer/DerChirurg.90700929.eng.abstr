 A few months ago an endovascular implantable PTFE stent graft became commercially available. Since May 1998 we have treated 15 patients with extensive vascular occlusion at the femoropopliteal level. The implantation is carried out via a single inguinal approach in combination with conventional vascular surgical techniques like orthograde ringstripping of the superficial femoral artery, local TEA and patch-grafting of the femoral bifurcation, angioplasty, local lysis, etc. The self-expanding thin-walled PTFE stent prothesis appears to be a viable alternative to the femoropopliteal P1 bypass and can be performed under local anesthesia, percutaneously or through a small inguinal incision. The implantation can be carried out with minimal tissue trauma.
