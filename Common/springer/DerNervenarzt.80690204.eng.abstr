In the German mutlicentre ANI study comparing continuous prophylactic treatment with intermittent medication, the social situation of a large sample of 364 schizophrenic patients was investigated and followed up over a 2-year period of outpatient aftercare. Effective therapy and prophylaxis substantially reduced relapses and rehospitalization. On the other hand, the psychosocial situation still showed considerable disadvantages. Of the patients (35 years old on average), 60% were still unmarried. Almost one-half of the patients still lived alone or with their parents, and one-third lived a very solitary life. At the end of the 2-year aftercare period, one-third was able to earn their own living. Almost one-half retired early from their occupations. Predictors and intervening variables are presented in order to stimulate early rehabilitation approaches. Schizophrenics are particularly placed at a disadvantage by tighter competition in the employment market, even though the course of illness can be improve. Social psychiatry must to be involved in helping to improve social contacts, accommodation and employment in order to prevent major distress.
