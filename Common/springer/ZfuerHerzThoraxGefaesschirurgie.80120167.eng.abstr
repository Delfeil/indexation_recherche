  The anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies which often remains asymptomatic until the patients achieve advanced age but may also be clinically manifest already in infants and lead to sudden death. We report the diagnostics and surgical treatment in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child and the necessity of surgical repair. The diagnosis was incidentally made during an echocardiographic procedure and confirmed by coronary angiography. A reimplantation of the ano origin of the coronary artery was carried out wihtout using extra-corporal circulation. There were no postoperative complications. Due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the related coronary risk, surgical repair is recommended also for asymptomatic cases.
