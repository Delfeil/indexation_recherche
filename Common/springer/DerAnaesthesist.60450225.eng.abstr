Diagnosis of a perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) on the basis of measurement of the creatine kinase MB fraction (CKMB) alone is not always easy. Surgical traumatisation of muscle fibres can lead to false-positive elevations. Newly introduced laboratory tests for cardiac troponins seem to facilitate the diagnosis of PMI. We measured serum values of cardiac troponin T in 139 patients described in detail in part I and compared them with common diagnostic tools for myocardial infarction.
