 The objective of this study was to investigate whether the structure of the Mainz Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system warrants an adequate care of emergency patients a) within a certain time-frame, b) in any part of the city. We analyzed the influence of the city's infrastructural factors as well as bystander resuscitation upon structure and outcome elements of quality. The EMS system investigated serves a population of 190 000 in an 80 km2 area with four emergency ambulances manned with EMT-Ds and 1 physician-staffed Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) in a two-tiered system. From February 1992 until July 1993 we prospectively collected data from 171 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of non-traumatic etiology. Twenty-four of the patients were discharged from hospital (14%). Patients with ventricular fibrillation as first ECG-diagnosis had a 28% discharge rate (19 of 69). The time interval from call reception at the dispatch center until arrival of the emergency ambulance at the scene was 5 min, and 8 min for the MICU, respectively, which indicates a proper deployment of the vehicles. Both teams then took 0.83 min to reach the patient after leaving their vehicles, which indicates a suitable city structure for a swift patient access. Although short in median, single time intervals in peripheral parts of the city were delayed. This turned out to be a problem in cases when the MICU was not preceded by an emergency ambulance as first tier, which happened in 30% of the cases. Rescue teams had a significantly shorter access to patients collapsing in a public place as compared to patients collapsing at home (0.5 vs. 1 min, p = 0.01). Survival rates were also significantly higher in the first group (29 vs. 11%, p = 0.039). With a rate of 25% bystander resuscitation turned out to be a problem. Half of these bystanders were medical professionals, leaving a layperson resuscitation rate of 13%. With the following system changes the problems identified in our investigation could be solved, and the overall effectiveness of the system could be improved:...
