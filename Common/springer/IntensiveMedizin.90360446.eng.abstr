 In general, assessment of the correct placement of a central venous catheter is performed by fluoroscopy or by postinsertional chest X-ray. We report a case of intraaortic malposition of a central venous catheter in a 59-year-old male patient that was not detectable in chest films. Further exploration of this patient revealed a left-sided superior vena cava.
