Hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Intensive ambulatory obstetric care is likley to achieve a risk reduction with the following topics: early identification of typical signs of preeclampsia, detection of uteroplacental insufficiency and their consequences and early admission to a specialized obstetric care unit or perinatal center. There are no established methods for the prevention of preeclampsia. Women who are at increased risk for having preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies might be appropriate candidates for low-dose aspirin during pregnancy; prophylactic calcium supplementation is controversial. To prevent cerebrovascular complications antihypertensive therapy is mandatory. Alpha-Methyl-dopa is the initial drug of choice for oral long-term treatment. In severe preeclampsia continuous monitoring and laboratory evalution of the mother and the fetus are required. Immediate introduction of therapy, including continuous infusion of magnesium sulfate to prevent convulsions, hydralzine to reduce blood pressure and careful volume expansion, is necessary. Under intensive monitoring, prolongation of pregnancy in patients at 25 to 32 weeks' gestation is reasonable under the following conditions: stable maternal condition, no suspected or manifest DIC and fetal well-being. Immediate delivery is indicated in cases of therapy-refractary severe preeclampsia, imminent eclampsia, after an eclamptic convulsion, and signs of intrauterine fetal asphyxia.
