 The interactions of 2-adrenoceptor agonists with anaesthetics, analgesics and local anaesthetics are not only of practical importance in many areas of anaesthesia and pain therapy, but also of significant theoretical interest. Laboratory investigations and animal research allow us to study the pharmacological mechanisms of these drug interactions by using the tools of molecular biology. This may lead to the establishment of a scientific basis allowing the definition of rational drug therapies. In the first part of this overview, recent data on local anaesthetic effects of 2-adrenoceptor agonists on peripheral nerve conduction and their interaction with local anaesthetics are presented. Some important experimental work focusing on additive and synergistic spinal interactions of 2-adrenoceptor agonists with opioids and some other agents are then discussed. Finally, there is a brief reference to the central role of the spinal cord in mediating and controlling nociception.
