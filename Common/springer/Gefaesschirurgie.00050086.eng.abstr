Abstract  Corrective vascular surgery of the SSS is not indicated in cases in which angiography has revealed retrograde blood flow in the vertebral artery in the presence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery. Primary complaints requiring therapy have to be present. Symptoms due to the reduced blood perfusion of the brain are regularly present. Brachial ischemia is rarely an indication for vascular intervention. Re-insertion of the subclavian artery into the common carotid artery a. carotis communis (SCT) is an appropriate procedure to re-establish orthograde blood flow in the arm and brain. It is, however, possible that the therapeutic aim is thwarted due to hemodynamic changes in the area of the origin of the vertebral artery. The cerebral neurological symptoms are efficiently eliminated by re-insertion of the vertebral artery. The early and late results of this operation were analyzed in a patient population of 31 patients. The operative result needed revision in two cases, with a successful outcome in one case. The primary patency rate was 96.77%. After a mean follow-up period of 48.5months (4-106) 24 patients were examined again, with all reconstructions that had postoperatively been patent functioning well. The re-insertion technique offers the same benefits as are emphasized by the literature recommending SCT (no prosthetic material to be used, preventing typical complications due to alloplastic material - carrying out only one anastomosis which is hemodynamically favorable, eliminating the source of embolism with regard to the brain, short operation and clamping times). In addition, vertebral re-insertion is the only method which enables simultaneous correction of concurrent pathological vascular changes of the proximal vertebral artery - such as the arteriosclerotic plaque, age-dependenting elongation und kinking or (mostly) inborne kcoiling. Thus, an intervention according to Kieffer is to be considered the method of first choice for patients with SSS showing no brachial symptoms (90 %) (6.7). For patients with brachial symptoms, a combined re-insertion and SCT is to be recommended. Here the SCT is carried out distally to the primary re-inserted vertebral artery during the same surgical intervention.
