  1911 informal caregivers from the Federal Republic of Germany who care for someone with a chronic, non-congenital condition rendering them in need of "hands-on" nursing completed a standardized questionnaire on their situation as caregivers. The informants were found through magazine advertisements as well as through dissemination of the questionnaires via contact persons in the social services.
