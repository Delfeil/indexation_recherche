Abstract   Patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment. The aim of the study was to compare health-related quality of life in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular or conventional surgery. A total of 40 patients were included (20 treated by endovascular and 20 by conventional surgery). A questionnaire with 28 items similar to the SF-36 was answered during scheduled appointments. On the third postoperative day, the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed (80% vs. 32%) and complained of intervention-related pain (90% vs. 42%) and incisional pain (26% vs. 15%); 55% of the patients suffered from obstipation (vs. 5% of the endovascular group). Furthermore, the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified. In comparable percentage, both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively. Sexual dysfunction was more frequent in the conventional group (33% vs. 13% three months postoperative). In addition, the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities (25% vs. 40%) and had more fear of ambulation (35% vs. 6%). The patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations (39% vs. 5%) that were often related to X-ray exposure (67% vs. 20%). All of the conventionally operated patients had a sense of improvement (vs. 89% of the endovascular group); nevertheless only 28% felt completely healthy, compared to 11% of the endovascular treated patients. Advantages of the endovascular treated patients were "short hospital stay", "decreased pain", "smaller scars", and a "shorter confinement to bed". After intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality-of-life aspects. After 3 months, differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities. The patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent X-ray examinations than the conventionally treated group.
